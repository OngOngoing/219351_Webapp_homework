10039-8{_}5{_}III   EDITED BY MONTAGUE SUMMERS   MCMXV    CONTENTS:  THE TOWN-FOP; OR, SIR TIMOTHY TAWDREY THE FALSE COUNT THE LUCKY CHANCE; OR, AN ALDERMAN'S BARGAIN THE FORC'D MARRIAGE; OR, THE JEALOUS BRIDEGROOM THE EMPEROR OF THE MOON NOTES       THE TOWN-FOP; OR, SIR TIMOTHY TAWDREY.
10039-8{_}6{_}ARGUMENT.
10039-8{_}7{_}Sir Timothy Tawdrey is by the wishes of his mother and the lady's father designed for Celinda, who loves Bellmour, nephew to Lord Plotwell.
10039-8{_}8{_}A coxcomb of the first water, Sir Timothy receives a sharp rebuff when he opens his suit, and accordingly he challenges Bellmour, but fails to appear at the place of meeting.
10039-8{_}9{_}Celinda's old nurse, at night, admits Bellmour to her mistress' chamber, where they are surprized by Friendlove, her brother, who is, however, favourable to the union, the more so as he is a friend of Bellmour, and they have but newly returned from travelling together in Italy.
10039-8{_}10{_}Lord Plotwell warmly welcomes his nephew home, and proceeds to unfold his design of giving him his niece Diana in marriage.
10039-8{_}11{_}When he demurs, the old lord threatens to deprive him of his estate, and he is compelled eventually to acquiesce in the matrimonial schemes of his guardian.
10039-8{_}12{_}Bellmour sends word to Celinda, who replies in a heart-broken letter; and at the wedding feast Friendlove, who himself is deeply enamoured of Diana, appears in disguise to observe the traitor.
10039-8{_}13{_}He is followed by his sister disguised as a boy, and upon Friendlove's drawing on Bellmour a scuffle ensues which, however, ends without harm.
10039-8{_}14{_}In the nuptial chamber Bellmour informs Diana that he cannot love her and she quits him maddened with rage and disappointment.
10039-8{_}15{_}Sir Timothy serenades the newly-mated pair and is threatened by Bellmour, whilst Celinda, who has been watching the house, attacks the fop and his fiddlers.
10039-8{_}16{_}During the brawl Diana issuing forth meets Celinda, and taking her for a boy leads her into the house and shortly makes advances of love.
10039-8{_}17{_}They are interrupted by Friendlove, disguised, and he receives Diana's commands to seek out and challenge Bellmour.
10039-8{_}18{_}At the same time he reveals his love as though he told the tale of another, but he is met with scorn and only bidden to fight the husband who has repulsed her.
10039-8{_}19{_}Bellmour, meantime, in despair and rage at his misery plunges into reckless debauchery, and in company with Sir Timothy visits a bagnio, where they meet Betty Flauntit, the knight's kept mistress, and other cyprians.
10039-8{_}20{_}Hither they are tracked by Charles, Bellmour's younger brother, and Trusty, Lord Plotwell's old steward.
10039-8{_}21{_}Sharp words pass, the brothers fight and Charles is slighted wounded.
10039-8{_}22{_}Their Uncle hears of this with much indignation, and at the same time receiving a letter from Diana begging for a divorce, he announces his intention to further her purpose, and to abandon wholly Charles and Phillis, his sister, in consequence of their elder brother's conduct.
10039-8{_}23{_}Sir Timothy, induced by old Trusty, begins a warm courtship of Phillis, and arranges with a parasite named Sham to deceive her by a mock marriage.
10039-8{_}24{_}Sham, however, procures a real parson, and Sir Timothy is for the moment afraid he has got a wife without a dowry or portion.
10039-8{_}25{_}Lord Plotwell eventually promises to provide for her, and at Diana's request, now she recognizes her mistake in trying to hold a man who does not love her, Bellmour is forgiven and allowed to wed Celinda as soon as the divorce has been pronounced, whilst Diana herself rewards Friendlove with her hand.
10039-8{_}26{_}SOURCE.
10039-8{_}27{_}_The Town-Fop; or, Sir Timothy Tawdrey_ is materially founded upon George Wilkins' popular play, _The Miseries of Enforced Marriage_ (4to, 1607, 1611, 1629, 1637), reprinted in Dodsley.
10039-8{_}28{_}Sir Timothy himself is moulded to some extent upon Sir Francis Ilford, but, as Geneste aptly remarks, he may be considered a new character.
10039-8{_}29{_}In the older drama, Clare, the original of Celinda, dies tragically of a broken heart.
10039-8{_}30{_}It cannot be denied that Mrs. Behn has greatly improved Wilkins' scenes.
10039-8{_}31{_}The well-drawn character of Betty Flauntit is her own, and the realistically vivacious bagnio episodes of Act iv replace a not very interesting or lively tavern with a considerable accession to wit and humour, although perhaps not to strict propriety.
10039-8{_}32{_}THEATRICAL HISTORY.
10039-8{_}33{_}_The Town-Fop; or, Sir Timothy Tawdrey_ was produced at the Duke's Theatre, Dorset Garden, in September, 1676.
10039-8{_}34{_}There is no record of its performance, and the actors' names are not given.
10039-8{_}35{_}It was a year of considerable changes in the company, and any attempt to supply these would be the merest surmise.
10039-8{_}36{_}THE TOWN-FOP; or, Sir _Timothy Tawdrey_.
10039-8{_}37{_}PROLOGUE.
10039-8{_}38{_}_As Country Squire, who yet had never known The long-expected Joy of being in Town; Whose careful Parents scarce permitted Heir To ride from home, unless to neighbouring Fair; At last by happy Chance is hither led, To purchase Clap with loss of Maidenhead; Turns wondrous gay, bedizen'd to Excess; Till he is all Burlesque in Mode and Dress: Learns to talk loud in Pit, grows wily too, That is to say, makes mighty Noise and Show.
10039-8{_}39{_}So a young Poet, who had never been Dabling beyond the Height of Ballading; Who, in his brisk Essays, durst ne'er excel The lucky Flight of rhyming Doggerel, Sets up with this sufficient Stock on Stage, And has, perchance, the luck to please the Age.
10039-8{_}40{_}He draws you in, like cozening Citizen; Cares not how bad the Ware, so Shop be fine.
10039-8{_}41{_}As tawdry Gown and Petticoat gain more (Tho on a dull diseas'd ill-favour'd Whore) Than prettier Frugal, tho on Holy-day,         | When every City-Spark has leave to play_,      | --Damn her, she must be sound, she is so gay;  | _So let the Scenes be fine, you'll ne'er enquire For Sense, but lofty Flights in nimble Wire.
10039-8{_}42{_}--What we present to Day is none of these, But we cou'd wish it were, for we wou'd please, And that you'll swear we hardly meant to do: Yet here's no Sense; Pox on't, but here's no Show; But a plain Story, that will give a Taste Of what your Grandsires lov'd i'th' Age that's past_.

10039-8{_}64{_}ACT I.
10039-8{_}65{_}SCENE I.
10039-8{_}66{_}_The Street_.
10039-8{_}67{_}_Enter Sir_ Timothy Tawdrey, Sham, _and_ Sharp.
10039-8{_}68{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}69{_}Hereabouts is the House wherein dwells the Mistress of my Heart; for she has Money, Boys, mind me, Money in abundance, or she were not for me--The Wench her self is good-natur'd, and inclin'd to be civil: but a Pox on't--she has a Brother, a conceited Fellow, whom the World mistakes for a fine Gentleman; for he has travell'd, talks Languages, bows with a _bonne mine_, and the rest; but, by Fortune, he shall entertain you with nothing but Words--  _Sham_.
10039-8{_}70{_}Nothing else!--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}71{_}No--He's no Country-Squire, Gentlemen, will not game, whore; nay, in my Conscience, you will hardly get your selves drunk in his Company--He treats A-la-mode, half Wine, half Water, and the rest--But to the Business, this Fellow loves his Sister dearly, and will not trust her in this leud Town, as he calls it, without him; and hither he has brought her to marry me.
10039-8{_}72{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}73{_}A Pox upon him for his Pains--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}74{_}So say I--But my Comfort is, I shall be as weary of her, as the best Husband of 'em all.
10039-8{_}75{_}But there's Conveniency in it; besides, the Match being as good as made up by the old Folks in the Country, I must submit--The Wench I never saw yet, but they say she's handsom--But no matter for that, there's Money, my Boys.
10039-8{_}76{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}77{_}Well, Sir, we will follow you--but as dolefully as People do their Friends to the Grave, from whence they're never to return, at least not the same Substance; the thin airy Vision of a brave good Fellow, we may see thee hereafter, but that's the most.
10039-8{_}78{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}79{_}Your Pardon, sweet _Sharp_, my whole Design in it is to be Master of my self, and with part of her Portion to set up my Miss, _Betty Flauntit_; which, by the way, is the main end of my marrying; the rest you'll have your shares of--Now I am forc'd to take you up Suits at treble Prizes, have damn'd Wine and Meat put upon us, 'cause the Reckoning is to be book'd: But ready Money, ye Rogues!
10039-8{_}80{_}What Charms it has!
10039-8{_}81{_}makes the Waiters fly, Boys, and the Master with Cap in Hand--excuse what's amiss, Gentlemen--Your Worship shall command the best--and the rest--How briskly the Box and Dice dance, and the ready Money submits to the lucky Gamester, and the gay Wench consults with every Beauty to make her self agreeable to the Man with ready Money!
10039-8{_}82{_}In fine, dear Rogues, all things are sacrific'd to its Power; and no Mortal conceives the Joy of Argent Content.
10039-8{_}83{_}'Tis this powerful God that makes me submit to the Devil, Matrimony; and then thou art assur'd of me, my stout Lads of brisk Debauch.
10039-8{_}84{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}85{_}And is it possible you can be ty'd up to a Wife?
10039-8{_}86{_}Whilst here in _London_, and free, you have the whole World to range in, and like a wanton Heifer, eat of every Pasture.
10039-8{_}87{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}88{_}Why, dost think I'll be confin'd to my own dull Enclosure?
10039-8{_}89{_}No, I had rather feed coarsely upon the boundless Common; perhaps two or three days I may be in love, and remain constant, but that's the most.
10039-8{_}90{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}91{_}And in three Weeks, should you wed a _Cynthia_, you'd be a Monster.
10039-8{_}92{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}93{_}What, thou meanest a Cuckold, I warrant.
10039-8{_}94{_}God help thee!
10039-8{_}95{_}But a Monster is only so from its Rarity, and a Cuckold is no such strange thing in our Age.
10039-8{_}96{_}_Enter_ Bellmour _and_ Friendlove.
10039-8{_}97{_}But who comes here?
10039-8{_}98{_}_Bellmour!_ Ah, my little dear Rogue!
10039-8{_}99{_}how dost thou?
10039-8{_}100{_}--_Ned Friendlove_ too!
10039-8{_}101{_}Dear Lad, how dost thou too?
10039-8{_}102{_}Why, welcome to Town, i'faith, and I'm glad to see you both.
10039-8{_}103{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}104{_}Sir _Timothy Tawdrey!_--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}105{_}The same, by Fortune, dear _Ned_: And how, and how, Man, how go Matters?
10039-8{_}106{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}107{_}Between who, Sir?
10039-8{_}108{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}109{_}Why, any Body, Man; but, by Fortune, I'm overjoy'd to meet thee: But where dost think I was going?
10039-8{_}110{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}111{_}Is't possible one shou'd divine?
10039-8{_}112{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}113{_}Is't possible you shou'd not, and meet me so near your Sister's Lodgings?
10039-8{_}114{_}Faith, I was coming to pay my Respects and Services, and the rest--Thou know'st my meaning--The old Business of the Silver-World, _Ned_; by Fortune, it's a mad Age we live in, _Ned_; and here be so many--wicked Rogues, about this damn'd leud Town, that, 'faith, I am fain to speak in the vulgar modish Style, in my own Defence, and railly Matrimony and the rest.
10039-8{_}115{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}116{_}Matrimony!--I hope you are so exactly refin'd a Man of the Town, that you will not offer once to think of so dull a thing: let that alone for such cold Complexions as _Bellmour_ here, and I, that have not attain'd to that most excellent faculty of Keeping yet, as you, Sir _Timothy_, have done; much to your Glory, I assure you.
10039-8{_}117{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}118{_}Who, I, Sir?
10039-8{_}119{_}You do me much Honour: I must confess I do not find the softer Sex cruel; I am received as well as another Man of my Parts.
10039-8{_}120{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}121{_}Of your Money you mean, Sir.
10039-8{_}122{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}123{_}Why, 'faith, _Ned_, thou art i'th' right; I love to buy my Pleasure: for, by Fortune, there's as much pleasure in Vanity and Variety, as any Sins I know; What think'st thou, _Ned?_  _Friend_.
10039-8{_}124{_}I am not of your Mind, I love to love upon the square; and that I may be sure not to be cheated with false Ware, I present 'em nothing but my Heart.
10039-8{_}125{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}126{_}Yes, and have the Consolation of seeing your frugal huswifery Miss in the Pit, at a Play, in a long Scarf and Night-gown, for want of Points, and Garniture.
10039-8{_}127{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}128{_}If she be clean, and pretty, and drest in Love, I can excuse the rest, and so will she.
10039-8{_}129{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}130{_}I vow to Fortune, _Ned_, thou must come to _London_, and be a little manag'd: 'slife, Man, shouldst thou talk so aloud in good Company, thou wouldst be counted a strange Fellow.
10039-8{_}131{_}Pretty--and drest with Love--a fine Figure, by Fortune: No, _Ned_, the painted Chariot gives a Lustre to every ordinary Face, and makes a Woman look like Quality; Ay, so like, by Fortune, that you shall not know one from t'other, till some scandalous, out-of-favour'd laid-aside Fellow of the Town, cry--Damn her for a Bitch--how scornfully the Whore regards me--She has forgot since _Jack_--such a one, and I, club'd for the keeping of her, when both our Stocks well manag'd wou'd not amount to above seven Shillings six Pence a week; besides now and then a Treat of a Breast of Mutton from the next Cook's.--Then the other laughs, and crys--Ay, rot her--and tells his Story too, and concludes with, Who manages the Jilt now; Why, faith, some dismal Coxcomb or other, you may be sure, replies the first.
10039-8{_}132{_}But, _Ned_, these are Rogues, and Rascals, that value no Man's Reputation, because they despise their own.
10039-8{_}133{_}But faith, I have laid aside all these Vanities, now I have thought of Matrimony; but I desire my Reformation may be a Secret, because, as you know, for a Man of my Address, and the rest--'tis not altogether so Jantee.
10039-8{_}134{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}135{_}Sir, I assure you, it shall be so great a Secret for me, that I will never ask you who the happy Woman is, that's chosen for this great Work of your Conversion.
10039-8{_}136{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}137{_}Ask me--No, you need not, because you know already.
10039-8{_}138{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}139{_}Who, I?
10039-8{_}140{_}I protest, Sir _Timothy_--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}141{_}No Swearing, dear _Ned_, for 'tis not such a Secret, but I will trust my Intimates: these are my Friends, _Ned_; pray know them--This Mr. _Sham_, and this--by Fortune, a very honest Fellow [_Bows to 'em_] Mr. _Sharp_, and may be trusted with a Bus'ness that concerns you as well as me.
10039-8{_}142{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}143{_}Me!
10039-8{_}144{_}What do you mean, Sir _Timothy_?
10039-8{_}145{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}146{_}Why, Sir, you know what I mean.
10039-8{_}147{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}148{_}Not I, Sir.
10039-8{_}149{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}150{_}What, not that I am to marry your Sister _Celinda_?
10039-8{_}151{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}152{_}Not at all.
10039-8{_}153{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}154{_}O, this insufferable Sot!
10039-8{_}155{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}156{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}157{_}My Sister, Sir, is very nice.
10039-8{_}158{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}159{_}That's all one, Sir, the old People have adjusted the matter, and they are the most proper for a Negotiation of that kind, which saves us the trouble of a tedious Courtship.
10039-8{_}160{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}161{_}That the old People have agreed the matter, is more than I know.
10039-8{_}162{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}163{_}Why, Lord, Sir, will you persuade me to that?
10039-8{_}164{_}Don't you know that your Father (according to the Method in such Cases, being certain of my Estate) came to me thus--Sir _Timothy Tawdrey_,--you are a young Gentleman, and a Knight, I knew your Father well, and my right worshipful Neighbour, our Estates lie together; therefore, Sir, I have a desire to have a near Relation with you--At which, I interrupted him, and cry'd--Oh Lord, Sir, I vow to Fortune, you do me the greatest Honour, Sir, and the rest--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}165{_}I can endure no more; he marry fair _Celinda_!
10039-8{_}166{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}167{_}Prithee let him alone.
10039-8{_}168{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}169{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}170{_}To which he answer'd--I have a good Fortune--have but my Son _Ned_, and this Girl, call'd _Celinda_, whom I will make a Fortune, sutable to yours; your honoured Mother, the Lady _Tawdrey_, and I, have as good as concluded the Match already.
10039-8{_}171{_}To which I (who, though I say it, am well enough bred for a Knight) answered the Civility thus--I vow to Fortune, Sir--I did not swear, but cry'd--I protest, Sir, _Celinda_, deserves--no, no, I lye again, 'twas merits--Ay, _Celinda_--merits a much better Husband than I.
10039-8{_}172{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}173{_}You speak more Truth than you are aware of.
10039-8{_}174{_}[_Aside_.]
10039-8{_}175{_}Well, Sir, I'll bring you to my Sister; and if she likes you, as well as My Father does, she's yours; otherwise, I have so much Tenderness for her, as to leave her Choice free.
10039-8{_}176{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}177{_}Oh, Sir, you compliment.
10039-8{_}178{_}_Alons, Entrons.

10039-8{_}180{_}SCENE II.
10039-8{_}181{_}_A Chamber_.
10039-8{_}182{_}_Enter_ Celinda, _and_ Nurse.
10039-8{_}183{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}184{_}I wonder my Brother stays so long: sure Mr. _Bellmour_ is not yet arriv'd, yet he sent us word he would be here to day.
10039-8{_}185{_}Lord, how impatient I grow!
10039-8{_}186{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}187{_}Ay, so methinks; if I had the hopes of enjoying so sweet a Gentleman as Mr. _Bellmour_, I shou'd be so too--But I am past it--Well, I have had my Pantings, and Heavings, my Impatience, and Qualms, my Heats, and my Colds, and my I know not whats--But I thank my Stars, I have done with all those Fooleries.
10039-8{_}188{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}189{_}Fooleries!-- Is there any thing in Life but Love?
10039-8{_}190{_}Wou'dst thou praise Heaven for thy Being, Without that grateful part of it?
10039-8{_}191{_}For I confess I love.
10039-8{_}192{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}193{_}You need not, your Sighs, and daily (nay, and nightly too) Disorders, plainly enough betray the Truth.
10039-8{_}194{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}195{_}Thou speak'st as if it were a Sin: But if it be so, you your self help'd to make me wicked.
10039-8{_}196{_}For e'er I saw Mr. _Bellmour_, you spoke the kindest things of him, As would have mov'd the dullest Maid to love; And e'er I saw him, I was quite undone.
10039-8{_}197{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}198{_}Quite undone!
10039-8{_}199{_}Now God forbid it; what, for loving?
10039-8{_}200{_}You said but now there was no Life without it.
10039-8{_}201{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}202{_}But since my Brother came from _Italy_, And brought young _Bellmour_ to our House, How very little thou hadst said of him!
10039-8{_}203{_}How much above thy Praise, I found the Youth!
10039-8{_}204{_}_Nur_.

10039-8{_}208{_}Or I must die.
10039-8{_}209{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}210{_}Ay, but you know the Lord _Plotwell_ has the Possession of all his Estate, and if he marry without his liking, has Power to take away all his Fortune, and then I think it were not so good marrying him.

10039-8{_}212{_}Not marrying him!
10039-8{_}213{_}Oh, canst thou think so poorly of me?
10039-8{_}214{_}Yes, I would marry him, though our scanty Fortune Cou'd only purchase us A lonely Cottage, in some silent Place, All cover'd o'er with Thatch, Defended from the Outrages of Storms By leafless Trees, in Winter; and from Heat, With Shades, which their kind Boughs wou'd bear anew; Under whose Covert we'd feed our gentle Flock, That shou'd in gratitude repay us Food, And mean and humble Clothing.

10039-8{_}219{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}220{_}Good lack!
10039-8{_}221{_}how prettily Love teaches his Scholars to prattle.-- But hear ye, fair Mrs. _Celinda_, you have forgot to what end and purpose you came to Town; not to marry Mr. _Bellmour_, as I take it--but Sir _Timothy Tawdrey_, that Spark of Men.
10039-8{_}222{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}223{_}Oh, name him not--Let me not in one Moment Descend from Heaven to Hell-- How came that wretched thing into thy Noddle?
10039-8{_}224{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}225{_}Faith, Mistress, I took pity of thee, I saw you so elevated with Thoughts of Mr. _Bellmour_, I found it necessary to take you down a degree lower.
10039-8{_}226{_}_Cel_.

10039-8{_}243{_}Oh Lord, oh Lord, not return a Compliment.
10039-8{_}244{_}Faith, _Ned_, thy Sister's quite spoil'd, for want of Town-Education; 'tis pity, for she's devilish pretty.
10039-8{_}245{_}_Friend_.

10039-8{_}359{_}This--thou art so sorry a Creature, thou wilt endure any thing for the lucre of her Fortune; 'tis that thou hast a Passion for: not that thou carest for Money, but to sacrifice to thy Leudness, to purchase a Mistress, to purchase the Reputation of as errant a Fool as ever arriv'd at the Honour of keeping; to purchase a little Grandeur, as you call it; that is, to make every one look at thee, and consider what a Fool thou art, who else might pass unregarded amongst the common Croud.
10039-8{_}360{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}361{_}The Devil's in her Tongue, and so 'tis in most Women's of her Age; for when it has quitted the Tail, it repairs to her upper Tire.

10039-8{_}370{_}Yes, Sir, Knight of the ill-favour'd Countenance is it?

10039-8{_}465{_}Oh, are you come--Your Hour was Twelve, and now 'tis almost Two.
10039-8{_}466{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}467{_}I could not get from _Friendlove_--Thou hast not told _Celinda_ of my coming?
10039-8{_}468{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}469{_}No, no, e'en make Peace for me, and your self too.
10039-8{_}470{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}471{_}I warrant thee, Nurse--Oh, how I hope and fear this Night's Success!

10039-8{_}474{_}_A Chamber_.
10039-8{_}475{_}Celinda _in her Night-Attire, leaning on a Table.
10039-8{_}476{_}Enter to her_ Bellmour _and_ Nurse.
10039-8{_}477{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}478{_}Oh Heavens!
10039-8{_}479{_}Mr. _Bellmour_ at this late Hour in my Chamber!
10039-8{_}480{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}481{_}Yes, Madam; but will approach no nearer till you permit me; And sure you know my Soul too well to fear.
10039-8{_}482{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}483{_}I do, Sir, and you may approach yet nearer, And let me know your Business.
10039-8{_}484{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}485{_}Love is my bus'ness, that of all the World; Only my Flame as much surmounts the rest, As is the Object's Beauty I adore.
10039-8{_}486{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}487{_}If this be all, to tell me of your Love, To morrow might have done as well.
10039-8{_}488{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}489{_}Oh, no, to morrow would have been too late, Too late to make returns to all my Pain.
10039-8{_}490{_}--What disagreeing thing offends your Eyes?
10039-8{_}491{_}I've no Deformity about my Person; I'm young, and have a Fortune great as any That do pretend to serve you; And yet I find my Interest in your Heart, Below those happy ones that are my Rivals.
10039-8{_}492{_}Nay, every Fool that can but plead his Title, And the poor Interest that a Parent gives him, Can merit more than I.
10039-8{_}493{_}--What else, my lovely Maid, can give a freedom To that same talking, idle, knighted Fop?
10039-8{_}494{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}495{_}Oh, if I am so wretched to be his, Surely I cannot live; For, Sir, I must confess I cannot love him.
10039-8{_}496{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}497{_}But thou may'st do as bad, and marry him, And that's a Sin I cannot over-live; --No, hear my Vows--  _Cel_.
10039-8{_}498{_}But are you, Sir, in earnest?
10039-8{_}499{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}500{_}In earnest?
10039-8{_}501{_}Yes, by all that's good, I am; I love you more than I do Life, or Heaven!
10039-8{_}502{_}_Cel_.

10039-8{_}504{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}505{_}--But pray, how long, Sir, have you lov'd me so?
10039-8{_}506{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}507{_}From the first moment that I saw your Eyes, Your charming killing Eyes, I did adore 'em; And ever since have languisht Day and Night.
10039-8{_}508{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}509{_}Come, come, ne'er stand asking of Questions, But follow your Inclinations, and take him at his Word.
10039-8{_}510{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}511{_}Celinda, take her Counsel, Perhaps this is the last opportunity; Nay, and, by Heaven, the last of all my Life, If you refuse me now-- Say, will you never marry Man but me?
10039-8{_}512{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}513{_}Pray give me till to morrow, Sir, to answer you; For I have yet some Fears about my Soul, That take away my Rest.
10039-8{_}514{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}515{_}To morrow!
10039-8{_}516{_}You must then marry--Oh fatal Word!
10039-8{_}517{_}Another!
10039-8{_}518{_}a Beast, a Fool, that knows not how to value you.

10039-8{_}520{_}Is't possible my Fate shou'd be so near?
10039-8{_}521{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}522{_}Nay, then dispose of your self, I say, and leave dissembling; 'tis high time.
10039-8{_}523{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}524{_}This Night the Letter came, the dreadful News Of thy being married, and to morrow too.
10039-8{_}525{_}Oh, answer me, or I shall die with Fear.
10039-8{_}526{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}527{_}I must confess it, Sir, without a blush, (For 'tis no Sin to love) that I cou'd wish-- Heaven and my Father were inclin'd my way: But I am all Obedience to their Wills.
10039-8{_}528{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}529{_}That Sigh was kind, But e'er to morrow this time, You'll want this pitying Sense, and feel no Pantings, But those which Joys and Pleasures do create.
10039-8{_}530{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}531{_}Alas, Sir!
10039-8{_}532{_}what is't you'd have me do?
10039-8{_}533{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}534{_}Why--I wou'd have you love, and after that You need not be instructed what to do.
10039-8{_}535{_}Give me your Faith, give me your solemn Vow To be my Wife, and I shall be at Peace.
10039-8{_}536{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}537{_}Have you consider'd, Sir, your own Condition?
10039-8{_}538{_}'Tis in your Uncle's Power to take your Fortune, If in your Choice you disobey his Will.
10039-8{_}539{_}--And, Sir, you know that mine is much below you.
10039-8{_}540{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}541{_}Oh, I shall calm his Rage, By urging so much Reason as thy Beauty, And my own Flame, on which my Life depends.
10039-8{_}542{_}--He now has kindly sent for me to _London_, I fear his Bus'ness-- Yet if you'll yield to marry me, We'll keep it secret, till our kinder Stars Have made provision for the blest Discovery.
10039-8{_}543{_}Come, give me your Vows, or we must part for ever.
10039-8{_}544{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}545{_}Part!
10039-8{_}546{_}Oh, 'tis a fatal Word!
10039-8{_}547{_}I will do any thing to save that Life, To which my own so nearly is ally'd.

10039-8{_}549{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}550{_}So, forward Sister!
10039-8{_}551{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}552{_}Ha, _Friendlove!_  _Friend_.
10039-8{_}553{_}Was it so kindly done, to gain my Sister Without my knowledge?
10039-8{_}554{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}555{_}Ah, Friend!
10039-8{_}556{_}'Twas from her self alone That I wou'd take the Blessing which I ask.
10039-8{_}557{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}558{_}And I'll assist her, Sir, to give it you.
10039-8{_}559{_}Here, take him as an Honour, and be thankful.
10039-8{_}560{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}561{_}I as a Blessing sent from Heaven receive her, And e'er I sleep will justify my Claim, And make her mine.
10039-8{_}562{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}563{_}Be not so hasty, Friend: Endeavour first to reconcile your Uncle to't.
10039-8{_}564{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}565{_}By such Delays we're lost: Hast thou forgot?
10039-8{_}566{_}To morrow she's design'd another's Bride!
10039-8{_}567{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}568{_}For that let me alone t'evade.

10039-8{_}570{_}If you must yet delay me, Give me leave not to interest such Wealth without Security.
10039-8{_}571{_}And I, _Celinda_, will instruct you how to satisfy my Fears.

10039-8{_}573{_}Bear witness to my Vows-- May every Plague that Heaven inflicts on Sin, Fall down in Thunder on my Head, If e'er I marry any but _Celinda_ Or if I do not marry thee, fair Maid.
10039-8{_}574{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}575{_}Heartily sworn, as I vow.
10039-8{_}576{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}577{_}And here I wish as solemnly the same: --May all arrive to me, If e'er I marry any Man but _Bellmour_!
10039-8{_}578{_}_Nur_.
10039-8{_}579{_}We are Witnesses, as good as a thousand.
10039-8{_}580{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}581{_}But now, my Friend, I'd have you take your leave; the day comes on apace, and you've not seen your Uncle since your Arrival.

10039-8{_}586{_}--Go--go--depart.
10039-8{_}587{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}588{_}I will--but 'tis as Misers part with Gold, Or People full of Health depart from Life.

10039-8{_}606{_}You know how long I have ador'd that Maid; But still her haughty Pride repell'd my Flame, And all its fierce Efforts.

10039-8{_}621{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}622{_}Well, Sir _Timothy_, I have most excellent News for you, that will do as well; I have found out--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}623{_}A new Wench, I warrant--But prithee, _Sham_, I have other matters in hand; 'Sheart, I am so mortify'd with this same thought of Fighting, that I shall hardly think of Womankind again.
10039-8{_}624{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}625{_}And you were so forward, Sir Timothy--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}626{_}Ay, _Sharp_, I am always so when I am angry; had I been but A little more provok'd then, that we might have gone to't when the heat was brisk, I had done well--but a Pox on't, this fighting in cool Blood I hate.
10039-8{_}627{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}628{_}'Shaw, Sir, 'tis nothing, a Man wou'd do't for Exercise in a Morning.
10039-8{_}629{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}630{_}Ay, if there were no more in't than Exercise; if a Man cou'd take a Breathing without breathing a Vein--but, _Sham_, this Wounds, and Blood, sounds terribly in my Ears; but since thou say'st 'tis nothing, prithee do thou meet _Bellmour_ in my stead; thou art a poor Dog, and 'tis no matter if the World were well rid of thee.
10039-8{_}631{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}632{_}I wou'd do't with all my Soul--but your Honour, Sir--  Sir _Tim_.--My Honour!
10039-8{_}633{_}'tis but Custom that makes it honourable to fight Duels--I warrant you the wise _Italian_ thinks himself a Man of Honour; and yet when did you hear of an _Italian_, that ever fought a Duel?
10039-8{_}634{_}Is't not enough, that I am affronted, have my Mistress taken away before my Face, hear my self call'd, dull, common Man, dull Animal, and the rest?--But I must after all give him leave to kill me too, if he can--And this is your damn'd Honourable _English_ way of shewing a Man's Courage.
10039-8{_}635{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}636{_}I must confess I am of your mind, and therefore have been studying a Revenge, sutable to the Affront: and if I can judge any thing, I have hit it.

10039-8{_}641{_}Why, Sir--what think you of debauching his Sister?
10039-8{_}642{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}643{_}Why, is there such a thing in Nature?
10039-8{_}644{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}645{_}You know he has a Sister, Sir.
10039-8{_}646{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}647{_}Yes, rich, and fair.
10039-8{_}648{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}649{_}Both, or she were not worthy of your Revenge.
10039-8{_}650{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}651{_}Oh, how I love Revenge, that has a double Pleasure in it--and where--and where is this fine piece of Temptation?
10039-8{_}652{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}653{_}In being, Sir--but _Sharp_ here, and I, have been at some cost in finding her out.

10039-8{_}657{_}As a Goddess, Sir.
10039-8{_}658{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}659{_}And art thou sure she will be leud?
10039-8{_}660{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}661{_}Are we sure she's a Woman, Sir?--Sure, she's in her Teens, has Pride and Vanity--and two or three Sins more that I cou'd name, all which never fail to assist a Woman in Debauchery--But, Sir, there are certain People that belong to her, that must be consider'd too.
10039-8{_}662{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}663{_}Stay, Sir, e'er I part with more Money, I'll be certain what returns 'twill make me--that is, I'll see the Wench, not to inform my self, how well I like her, for that I shall do, because she is new, and _Bellmour's_ Sister--but to find what possibility there is in gaining her.--I am us'd to these things, and can guess from a Look, or a Kiss, or a Touch of the Hand--but then I warrant, 'twill come to the knowledge of _Betty Flauntit_.
10039-8{_}664{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}665{_}What, Sir, then it seems you doubt us?
10039-8{_}666{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}667{_}How do you mean, your Honesty or Judgment?
10039-8{_}668{_}I can assure you, I doubt both.
10039-8{_}669{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}670{_}How, Sir, doubt our Honesty!
10039-8{_}671{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}672{_}Yes--why, I hope neither of you pretend to either, do you?
10039-8{_}673{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}674{_}Why, Sir, what, do you take us for Cheats?
10039-8{_}675{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}676{_}As errant, as any's in Christendom.
10039-8{_}677{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}678{_}How, Sir?
10039-8{_}679{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}680{_}Why, how now--what, fly in my Face?
10039-8{_}681{_}Are your Stomachs so queasy, that Cheat won't down with you?
10039-8{_}682{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}683{_}Why, Sir, we are Gentlemen; and though our ill Fortunes have thrown us on your Bounty, we are not to be term'd--  Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}684{_}Why, you pair of Hectors--whence this Impudence?--Do ye know me, ye Raggamuffins?
10039-8{_}685{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}686{_}Yes, but we knew not that you were a Coward before.
10039-8{_}687{_}You talkt big, and huft where-e'er you came, like an errant Bully; and so long we reverenc'd you--but now we find you have need of our Courage, we'll stand on our own Reputations.

10039-8{_}689{_}Courage and Reputation!--ha, ha, ha--why, you lousy Tatterdemallions--dare ye talk of Courage and Reputation?
10039-8{_}690{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}691{_}Why, Sir, who dares question either?
10039-8{_}692{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}693{_}He that dares try it.
10039-8{_}694{_}[Kicks 'em.
10039-8{_}695{_}_Sharp_.
10039-8{_}696{_}Hold, Sir, hold.

10039-8{_}698{_}Enough, enough, we are satisfy'd.
10039-8{_}699{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}700{_}So am not I, ye mangy Mungrels, till I have kickt Courage and Reputation out of ye.

10039-8{_}704{_}Oh, are you so?
10039-8{_}705{_}then it seems I was not to be believ'd--I told you I had Courage when I was angry.

10039-8{_}707{_}Ay, Sir, we have prov'd it, and will now swear it.--But we had an Inclination to try, Sir.
10039-8{_}708{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}709{_}And all you did, was but to try my Courage, hah!

10039-8{_}713{_}Though I know ye to be cursed cowardly lying Rogues, yet because I have use of ye, I must forgive ye.--Here, kiss my Hand, and be forgiven.

10039-8{_}729{_}I had forgot it--A pox on't, this 'tis to have a Partner in A Coach; by Fortune, I must marry and set up a whole one.

10039-8{_}732{_}Lord Plotwell's House.
10039-8{_}733{_}Enter Charles Bellmour, and Trusty.
10039-8{_}734{_}_Trusty_.
10039-8{_}735{_}Mr. _Charles_, your Brother, my young Master _Bellmour_, is come.
10039-8{_}736{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}737{_}I'm glad on't; my Uncle began to be impatient that he came not, you saying you left him but a day's Journey behind you yesterday.
10039-8{_}738{_}My Uncle has something of importance to say to him, I fancy it may be about A Marriage between him and my Lady _Diana_--such a Whisper I heard--  _Trusty_.
10039-8{_}739{_}Ay, marry, Sir, that were a Match indeed, she being your Uncle's only Heir.
10039-8{_}740{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}741{_}Ay, but they are Sisters Children, and too near a-kin to be happy.
10039-8{_}742{_}_Trusty_.
10039-8{_}743{_}'Twere pity my young Master shou'd be unhappy in a Wife; for he is the sweetest-natur'd Gentleman--But one Comfort is, Mr. _Charles_, you, and your Sister Mrs. _Phillis_, will have your Portions assign'd you if he marry.
10039-8{_}744{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}745{_}Yes, that he can't deny us the very Day after his Marriage.
10039-8{_}746{_}_Trusty_.
10039-8{_}747{_}I shall be glad to see you all dispos'd of well; but I was half afraid, your Brother would have married Mrs. _Celinda Friendlove_, to whom he made notable Love in _Yorkshire_ I thought: not but she's a fine Lady; but her Fortune is below that of my young Master's, as much as my Lady _Diana's_ is above his--But see, they come; let us retire, to give 'em leave to talk alone.
10039-8{_}748{_}[_Exeunt_.
10039-8{_}749{_}_Enter_ _Lord_ Plotwell, _and_ Bellmour.
10039-8{_}750{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}751{_}And well, _Frank_, how dost thou find thy self inclin'd?
10039-8{_}752{_}thou should'st begin to think of something more than Books.
10039-8{_}753{_}Do'st thou not wish to know the Joys that are to be found in a Woman, _Frank_?
10039-8{_}754{_}I well remember at thy Age I fancy'd a thousand fine things of that kind.
10039-8{_}755{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}756{_}Ay, my Lord, a thousand more perhaps than are to be found.
10039-8{_}757{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}758{_}Not so; but I confess, _Frank_, unless the Lady be fair, and there be some Love too, 'tis not altogether so well; therefore I, who am still busy for thy good, have fix'd upon a Lady--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}759{_}Ha!--  _Lord_.
10039-8{_}760{_}What, dost start?
10039-8{_}761{_}Nay, I'll warrant thee she'll please; A Lady rich, and fair, and nobly born, and thou shalt marry her, _Frank_.
10039-8{_}762{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}763{_}Marry her, my Lord--  _Lord_.
10039-8{_}764{_}Why, yes, marry her--I hope you are none of the fashionable Fops, that are always in Mutiny against Marriage, who never think themselves very witty, but when they rail against Heaven and a Wife-- But, _Frank_, I have found better Principles in thee, and thou hast the Reputation of a sober young Gentleman; thou art, besides, a Man of great Fortune, _Frank_.
10039-8{_}765{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}766{_}And therefore, Sir, ought the less to be a Slave.
10039-8{_}767{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}768{_}But, _Frank_, we are made for one another; and ought, by the Laws of God, to communicate our Blessings.
10039-8{_}769{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}770{_}Sir, there are Men enough, fitter much than I, to obey those Laws; nor do I think them made for every one.
10039-8{_}771{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}772{_}But, _Frank_, you do not know what a Wife I have provided for you.
10039-8{_}773{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}774{_}'Tis enough I know she's a Woman, Sir.
10039-8{_}775{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}776{_}A Woman!
10039-8{_}777{_}why, what should she be else?
10039-8{_}778{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}779{_}An Angel, Sir, e'er she can be my Wife.
10039-8{_}780{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}781{_}In good time: but this is a Mortal, Sir--and must serve your turn--but, _Frank_, she is the finest Mortal--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}782{_}I humbly beg your Pardon, if I tell you, That had she Beauty such as Heav'n ne'er made, Nor meant again t'inrich a Woman with, It cou'd not take my Heart.
10039-8{_}783{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}784{_}But, Sir, perhaps you do not guess the Lady.
10039-8{_}785{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}786{_}Or cou'd I, Sir, it cou'd not change my Nature.
10039-8{_}787{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}788{_}But, Sir, suppose it be my Niece _Diana_.
10039-8{_}789{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}790{_}How, Sir, the fair _Diana_!
10039-8{_}791{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}792{_}I thought thou'dst come about again; What think you now of Woman-kind, and Wedlock?
10039-8{_}793{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}794{_}As I did before, my Lord.
10039-8{_}795{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}796{_}What, thou canst not think I am in earnest; I confess, _Frank_, she is above thee in point of Fortune, she being my only Heir--but suppose 'tis she.
10039-8{_}797{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}798{_}Oh, I'm undone!--Sir, I dare not suppose so greatly in favour of my self.
10039-8{_}799{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}800{_}But, _Frank_, you must needs suppose--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}801{_}Oh, I am ruin'd, lost, for ever lost.
10039-8{_}802{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}803{_}What do you mean, Sir?
10039-8{_}804{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}805{_}I mean, I cannot marry fair _Diana_.
10039-8{_}806{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}807{_}Death!
10039-8{_}808{_}how's this?
10039-8{_}809{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}810{_}She is a thing above my humble wishes--  _Lord_.
10039-8{_}811{_}Is that all?
10039-8{_}812{_}Take you no care for that; for she loves you already, and I have resolv'd it, which is better yet.
10039-8{_}813{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}814{_}Love me, Sir!
10039-8{_}815{_}I know she cannot, And Heav'n forbid that I should injure her.
10039-8{_}816{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}817{_}Sir, this is a Put-off: resolve quickly, or I'll compel you.
10039-8{_}818{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}819{_}You wou'd not use Extremity; What is the Forfeit of my Disobedience?
10039-8{_}820{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}821{_}The loss of all your Fortune, If you refuse the Wife I have provided-- Especially a handsom Lady, as she is, _Frank_.
10039-8{_}822{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}823{_}Oh me, unhappy!
10039-8{_}824{_}What cursed Laws provided this Severity?
10039-8{_}825{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}826{_}Even those of your Father's Disposal, who seeing so many Examples in this leud Age, of the ruin of whole Families by imprudent Marriages, provided otherwise for you.
10039-8{_}827{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}828{_}But, Sir, admit _Diana_ be inclin'd, And I (by my unhappy Stars so curs'd) Should be unable to accept the Honour.
10039-8{_}829{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}830{_}How, Sir!
10039-8{_}831{_}admit!--I can no more admit, Than you can suppose--therefore give me your final Answer.
10039-8{_}832{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}833{_}Sir, can you think a Blessing e'er can fall Upon that Pair, whom Interest joins, not Love?
10039-8{_}834{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}835{_}Why, what's in _Diana_, that you shou'd not love her?
10039-8{_}836{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}837{_}I must confess she has a thousand Virtues, The least of which wou'd bless another Man; But, Sir, I hope, if I am so unhappy As not to love that Lady, you will pardon me.
10039-8{_}838{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}839{_}Indeed, Sir, but I will not; love me this Lady, and marry me this Lady, or I will teach you what it is to refuse such a Lady.
10039-8{_}840{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}841{_}Sir, 'tis not in my power to obey you.
10039-8{_}842{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}843{_}How!
10039-8{_}844{_}not in your pow'r?
10039-8{_}845{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}846{_}No, Sir, I see my fatal Ruin in your Eyes, And know too well your Force, and my own Misery.
10039-8{_}847{_}--But, Sir--when I shall tell you who I've married--  _Lord_.
10039-8{_}848{_}Who you've married;--By all that's sacred, if that be true, thou art undone for ever.
10039-8{_}849{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}850{_}O hear me, Sir!
10039-8{_}851{_}I came with Hopes to have found you merciful.
10039-8{_}852{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}853{_}Expect none from me; no, thou shalt not have So much of thy Estate, as will afford thee Bread: By Heav'n, thou shalt not.
10039-8{_}854{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}855{_}Oh, pity me, my Lord, pity my Youth; It is no Beggar, nor one basely born, That I have given my Heart to, but a Maid, Whose Birth, whose Beauty, and whose Education Merits the best of Men.
10039-8{_}856{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}857{_}Very fine!
10039-8{_}858{_}where is the Priest that durst dispose of you without my Order?
10039-8{_}859{_}Sirrah, you are my Slave--at least your whole Estate is at my mercy--and besides, I'll charge you with an Action of 5000 pounds.
10039-8{_}860{_}For your ten Years Maintenance: Do you know that this in my power too?
10039-8{_}861{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}862{_}Yes, Sir, and dread your Anger worse than Death.
10039-8{_}863{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}864{_}Oh Villain!
10039-8{_}865{_}thus to dash my Expectation!
10039-8{_}866{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}867{_}Sir, on my bended Knees, thus low I fall To beg your mercy.
10039-8{_}868{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}869{_}Yes, Sir, I will have mercy; I'll give you Lodging--but in a Dungeon, Sir, Where you shall ask your Food of Passers by.
10039-8{_}870{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}871{_}All this, I know, you have the Pow'r to do; But, Sir, were I thus cruel, this hard Usage Would give me Cause to execute it.
10039-8{_}872{_}I wear a Sword, and I dare right my self; And Heaven wou'd pardon it, if I should kill you: But Heav'n forbid I shou'd correct that Law, Which gives you Power, and orders me Obedience.
10039-8{_}873{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}874{_}Very well, Sir, I shall tame that Courage, and punish that Harlot, whoe'er she be, that has seduc'd ye.
10039-8{_}875{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}876{_}How, Harlot, Sir!--Death, such another Word, And through all Laws and Reason I will rush, And reach thy Soul, if mortal like thy Body.
10039-8{_}877{_}--No, Sir, she's chaste, as are the new-made Vows I breath'd upon her Lips, when last we parted.
10039-8{_}878{_}_Lord_.
10039-8{_}879{_}Who waits there?
10039-8{_}880{_}Enter Trusty and Servants.
10039-8{_}881{_}--Shall I be murder'd in my own House?

10039-8{_}1375{_}I have consider'd thee, And find no Blemish in thy Soul, or Form; Thou art all o'er Divine, yet I must hate thee, Since thou hast drawn me to a mortal Sin, That cannot be forgiven by Men, or Heaven.

10039-8{_}1377{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1378{_}Instead of cooling this augments my Fire; No Pain is like defeated new Desire.

10039-8{_}1384{_}I'd rather hear thee swear, thou art my Foe, And like some noble and romantick Maid With Poniards wou'd my stubborn Heart invade; And whilst thou dost the faithful Relique tear, In every Vein thoud'st find _Celinda_ there.

10039-8{_}1386{_}Come, Sir, you must forget _Celinda's_ Charms, And reap Delights within my circling Arms, Delights that may your Errors undeceive, When you find Joys as great as she can give.

10039-8{_}1388{_}What do I hear?--is this the kind Relief Thou dost allow to my Despair and Grief?
10039-8{_}1389{_}Is this the Comfort that thou dost impart To my all-wounded, bleeding, dying Heart?

10039-8{_}1391{_}For cou'd I love thee, cou'd I love again, Our Lives wou'd be but one continu'd Sin: A Sin of that black dye, a Sin so foul, 'Twou'd leave no Hopes of Heav'n for either's Soul.

10039-8{_}1395{_}No, since my Passion thou'st defeated thus, And robb'd me of my long-wish'd Happiness, I'll make thee know what a wrong'd Maid can do, Divided 'twixt her Love and Injuries too.

10039-8{_}1414{_}--Why came I off alive, that fatal Place Where I beheld my _Bellmour_, in th'embrace Of my extremely fair, and lovely Rival?
10039-8{_}1415{_}--With what kind Care she did prevent my Arm, Which (greedy of the last sad-parting twine) I wou'd have thrown about him, as if she knew To what intent I made the passionate Offer?

10039-8{_}1423{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1424{_}Why, first sing a Baudy Song, and then break the Windows, in revenge for the Affront was put upon me to night.

10039-8{_}1426{_}Faith, Sir, that's but a poor Revenge, and which every Footman may take of his Lady, who has turn'd him away for filching--You know, Sir, Windows are frail, and will yield to the lusty Brickbats; 'tis an Act below a Gentleman.

10039-8{_}1428{_}That's all one, 'tis my Recreation; I serv'd a Woman so the other night, to whom my Mistress had a Pique.

10039-8{_}1433{_}how can that be?

10039-8{_}1435{_}Why, Sir, did you not mind, that he that drew upon _Bellmour_, was in the same Dress with you.

10039-8{_}1438{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}1439{_}Why, by the same Chance, that yours was like his--I suppose sending to the Play-house for them, as we did, they happened to send him such another Habit, for they have many such for dancing Shepherds.
10039-8{_}1440{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1441{_}Well, I grant it a Mistake, and that shall reprieve the Windows.

10039-8{_}1445{_}Ay, but between you and I, 'twas well he kick'd me first, and made me angry, or I had been lustily swing'd, by Fortune--But thanks to my Spleen, that sav'd my Bones that bout--But then I did well--hah, came briskly off, and the rest.

10039-8{_}1539{_}By Fortune, _Frank_, I do not like these Arts.
10039-8{_}1540{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1541{_}Then thou'rt a Fool--I'll teach thee to be rich too.
10039-8{_}1542{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1543{_}Ay, that I like.
10039-8{_}1544{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1545{_}Look here, my Boys!
10039-8{_}1546{_}[_Hold up his Writings, which he takes out of his Pockets_.
10039-8{_}1547{_}The Writings of 3000 pounds a Year: --All this I got by Perjury.
10039-8{_}1548{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1549{_}By Fortune, a thriving Sin.
10039-8{_}1550{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1551{_}And we will live in Sin while this holds out.
10039-8{_}1552{_}_And then to my cold Home--Come let's be gone: Oh, that I ne'er might see the rising Sun_.
10039-8{_}1553{_}[_Exeunt_.
10039-8{_}1554{_}ACT IV.
10039-8{_}1555{_}SCENE I. Celinda's _Chamber_.
10039-8{_}1556{_}_Discovers_ Celinda _as before sitting in a Chair_,     Diana _by her in another, who sings_.
10039-8{_}1557{_}SONG.
10039-8{_}1558{_}I.    Celinda, _who did Love disdain,   For whom had languished many a Swain,   Leading her bleating Flocks to drink,   She spy'd upon the River's brink   A Youth, whose Eyes did well declare   How much he lov'd, but lov'd not her_.
10039-8{_}1559{_}II.
10039-8{_}1560{_}_At first she laugh'd, but gaz'd the while,   And soon it lessen'd to a Smile;   Thence to surprize and wonder came,   Her Breast to heave, her Heart to flame;   Then cry'd she out, Ah, now I prove   Thou art a God, Almighty Love_.
10039-8{_}1561{_}III.
10039-8{_}1562{_}_She wou'd have spoke, but Shame deny'd,   And bad her first consult her Pride;   But soon she found that Aid was gone,   For Love, alas, had left her none.
10039-8{_}1563{_}Oh, how she burns, but 'tis too late,   For in his Eyes she reads her Fate_.
10039-8{_}1564{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1565{_}Oh, how numerous are her Charms --How shall I pay this generous Condescension?
10039-8{_}1566{_}Fair lovely Maid--  _Dia_.
10039-8{_}1567{_}Why do you flatter, Sir?
10039-8{_}1568{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1569{_}To say you're lovely, by your self I do not, I'm young, and have not much convers'd with Beauty: Yet I'll esteem my Judgment, since it knows Where my Devotions shou'd be justly paid.
10039-8{_}1570{_}--But, Madam, may I not yet expect To hear the Story, you so lately promis'd me?
10039-8{_}1571{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1572{_}I owe much to your Goodness, Sir--but--  _Cel_.
10039-8{_}1573{_}I am too young, you think, to hear a Secret; Can I want Sense to pity your Misfortunes, Or Passion to incite me to revenge 'em?
10039-8{_}1574{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1575{_}Oh, would he were in earnest!
10039-8{_}1576{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1577{_}She's fond of me, and I must blow that flame, Do any thing to make her hate my _Bellmour_.
10039-8{_}1578{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1579{_}--But, Madam, I'm impatient for your Story, That after that, you may expect my Service.
10039-8{_}1580{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1581{_}The Treatment you this night have given a distressed Maid, enough obliges me; nor need I tell you, I'm nobly born; something about my Dress, my Looks and Mien, will doubtless do me reason.
10039-8{_}1582{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1583{_}Sufficiently--  _Dia_.
10039-8{_}1584{_}But in the Family where I was educated, a Youth of my own Age, a Kinsman too, I chanc'd to fall in love with, but with a Passion my Pride still got the better of; and he, I thought, repaid my young Desires.
10039-8{_}1585{_}But Bashfulness on his part, did what Pride had done on mine, And kept his too conceal'd--At last my Uncle, who had the absolute Dominion of us both, thought good to marry us together.
10039-8{_}1586{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1587{_}Punish him, Heaven, for a Sin so great.
10039-8{_}1588{_}--And are you married then?
10039-8{_}1589{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1590{_}Why is there Terror in that Word?
10039-8{_}1591{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1592{_}By all that's Sacred, 'tis a Word that kills me.
10039-8{_}1593{_}Oh, say thou art not; And I thus low will fall, and pay thee Thanks.
10039-8{_}1594{_}[_Kneels_.
10039-8{_}1595{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1596{_}You'll wish indeed I were not, when you know How very, very wretched it has made me.
10039-8{_}1597{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1598{_}Shou'd you be telling me a Tale all day, Such as would melt a Heart that ne'er could love, 'Twould not increase my Reason for the wish That I had dy'd e'er known you had been married.
10039-8{_}1599{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1600{_}So many soft Words from my _Bellmour's_ mouth Had made me mad with Joy, and next to that I wish to hear 'em from this Youth; If they be real, how I shall be reveng'd!
10039-8{_}1601{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1602{_}--But why at my being married should you sigh?
10039-8{_}1603{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1604{_}Because I love, is that a Wonder, Madam?
10039-8{_}1605{_}Have you not Charms sufficient at first sight To wound a Heart tender and young as mine?
10039-8{_}1606{_}Are you not heavenly fair?
10039-8{_}1607{_}Oh, there's my Grief-- Since you must be another's.
10039-8{_}1608{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1609{_}Pray hear me out; and if you love me after, Perhaps you may not think your self unhappy.
10039-8{_}1610{_}When Night was come, the long'd for Night, and all Retir'd to give us silent Room for Joy--  _Cel_.
10039-8{_}1611{_}Oh, I can hear no more--by Heav'n, I cannot.
10039-8{_}1612{_}--Here--stab me to the Heart--let out my Life, I cannot live, and hear what follow'd next.
10039-8{_}1613{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1614{_}Pray hear me, Sir--  _Cel_.
10039-8{_}1615{_}Oh, you will tell me he was kind-- Yes, yes--oh God--were not his balmy Kisses Sweeter than Incense offer'd up to Heaven?
10039-8{_}1616{_}Did not his Arms, softer and whiter far Than those of _Jove's_ transform'd to Wings of Swans, Greedily clasp thee round?--Oh, quickly speak, Whilst thy fair rising Bosom met with his; And then--Oh--then--  _Dia_.
10039-8{_}1617{_}Alas, Sir!
10039-8{_}1618{_}What's the matter?--sit down a while.
10039-8{_}1619{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1620{_}Now--I am well--pardon me, lovely Creature, If I betray a Passion, I'm too young To've learnt the Art of hiding; --I cannot hear you say that he was kind.
10039-8{_}1621{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1622{_}Kind!
10039-8{_}1623{_}yes, as Blasts to Flow'rs, or early Fruit; All gay I met him full of youthful Heat: But like a Damp, he dasht my kindled Flame, And all his Reason was--he lov'd another, A Maid he call'd _Celinda_.
10039-8{_}1624{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1625{_}Oh blessed Man!
10039-8{_}1626{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1627{_}How, Sir?
10039-8{_}1628{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1629{_}To leave thee free, to leave thee yet a Virgin.
10039-8{_}1630{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1631{_}Yes, I have vow'd he never shall possess me.
10039-8{_}1632{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1633{_}Oh, how you bless me--but you still are married, And whilst you are so--I must languish--  _Dia_.
10039-8{_}1634{_}Oh, how his Softness moves me!
10039-8{_}1635{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1636{_}--But can all this Disorder spring from Love?
10039-8{_}1637{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1638{_}Or may I still prove wretched.
10039-8{_}1639{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1640{_}And can you think there are no ways For me to gratify that Love?
10039-8{_}1641{_}What ways am I constrain'd to use to work out my Revenge!
10039-8{_}1642{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1643{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1644{_}How mean you, Madam?
10039-8{_}1645{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1646{_}Without a Miracle, look on my Eyes-- And Beauty--which you say can kindle Fires; --She that can give, may too retain Desires.
10039-8{_}1647{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1648{_}She'll ravish me--let me not understand you.
10039-8{_}1649{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1650{_}Look on my Wrongs-- Wrongs that would melt a frozen Chastity, That a religious Vow had made to Heaven: --And next survey thy own Perfections.
10039-8{_}1651{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1652{_}Hah--  _Dia_.
10039-8{_}1653{_}Art thou so young, thou canst not apprehend me?
10039-8{_}1654{_}Fair bashful Boy, hast thou the Power to move, And yet not know the Bus'ness of thy Love?
10039-8{_}1655{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1656{_}How in an instant thou hast chill'd my Blood, And made me know no Woman can be good?
10039-8{_}1657{_}'Tis Sin enough to yield--but thus to sue Heav'n--'tis my Business--and not meant for you.
10039-8{_}1658{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1659{_}How little Love is understood by thee, 'Tis Custom, and not Passion you pursue; Because Enjoyment first was nam'd by me, It does destroy what shou'd your Flame renew: My easy yielding does your Fire abate, And mine as much your tedious Courtship hate.
10039-8{_}1660{_}Tell Heaven--you will hereafter sacrifice, --And see how that will please the Deities.
10039-8{_}1661{_}The ready Victim is the noblest way, Your Zeal and Obligations too to pay.
10039-8{_}1662{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1663{_}I think the Gods wou'd hardly be ador'd, If they their Blessings shou'd, unask'd, afford; And I that Beauty can no more admire, Who ere I sue, can yield to my Desire.
10039-8{_}1664{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1665{_}Dull Youth, farewel: For since 'tis my Revenge that I pursue Less Beauty and more Man as well may do.
10039-8{_}1666{_}[_Offers to go_.
10039-8{_}1667{_}_Enter_ Friendlove _disguised, as one from a Camp_.
10039-8{_}1668{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1669{_}Madam, you must not go with this Mistake.
10039-8{_}1670{_}[_Holds her_.
10039-8{_}1671{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1672{_}_Celinda_ has inform'd me true--'tis she-- Good morrow, Brother, what, so early at your Devotions?
10039-8{_}1673{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1674{_}O, my Brother's come, and luckily relieves me.
10039-8{_}1675{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1676{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1677{_}Your Orizons are made to a fair Saint.
10039-8{_}1678{_}--Pray, Sir, what Lady's that?
10039-8{_}1679{_}--Or is it blasphemy to repeat her Name?
10039-8{_}1680{_}--By my bright Arms, she's fair--With what a charming Fierceness, she charges through my Body to my Heart.
10039-8{_}1681{_}--Death!
10039-8{_}1682{_}how her glittering Eyes give Fire, and wound!
10039-8{_}1683{_}And have already pierc'd my very Soul!
10039-8{_}1684{_}--May I approach her, Brother?
10039-8{_}1685{_}_Cel_.
10039-8{_}1686{_}Yes, if you dare, there's danger in it though, She has Charms that will bewitch you: --I dare not stand their Mischief.
10039-8{_}1687{_}[_Exit_.
10039-8{_}1688{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1689{_}Lady, I am a Soldier--yet in my gentlest Terms I humbly beg to kiss your lovely Hands-- Death!
10039-8{_}1690{_}there's Magick in the Touch.
10039-8{_}1691{_}By Heaven, you carry an Artillery in every part.
10039-8{_}1692{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1693{_}This is a Man indeed fit for my purpose.
10039-8{_}1694{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1695{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1696{_}Nay, do not view me, I am no lovely Object; I am a Man bred up to Noise and War, And know not how to dress my Looks in Smiles; Yet trust me, fair one, I can love and serve As well as an _Endymion_, or _Adonis_.
10039-8{_}1697{_}Wou'd you were willing to permit that Service!
10039-8{_}1698{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1699{_}Why, Sir?--What cou'd you do?
10039-8{_}1700{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1701{_}Why--I cou'd die for you.
10039-8{_}1702{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1703{_}I need the Service of the living, Sir.
10039-8{_}1704{_}But do you love me, Sir?
10039-8{_}1705{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1706{_}Or let me perish, flying from a single Enemy.
10039-8{_}1707{_}I am a Gentleman, and may pretend to love you; And what you can command, I can perform.
10039-8{_}1708{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1709{_}Take heed, Sir, what you say, for I'm in earnest.
10039-8{_}1710{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1711{_}Command me any thing that's just and brave; And, by my Eyes, 'tis done.
10039-8{_}1712{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1713{_}I know not what you call just or brave; But those whom I do the Honour to command, Must not capitulate.
10039-8{_}1714{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1715{_}Let him be blasted with the Name of Coward, That dares dispute your Orders.
10039-8{_}1716{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1717{_}Dare you fight for me?

10039-8{_}1721{_}Nay, 'tis but a single Man.

10039-8{_}1727{_}Of _Yorkshire_?
10039-8{_}1728{_}Companion to young _Friendlove_, that came lately from _Italy_?

10039-8{_}1730{_}Yes, do you know him?
10039-8{_}1731{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1732{_}I do, who has oft spoke of _Bellmour_; We travel'd into _Italy_ together--But since, I hear, He fell in love with a fair cruel Maid, For whom he languishes.
10039-8{_}1733{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1734{_}Heard you her Name?
10039-8{_}1735{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1736{_}_Diana_, rich in Beauty, as in Fortune.
10039-8{_}1737{_}--Wou'd she had less of both, and more of Pity; And that I knew not how to wish, till now That I became a Lover, perhaps as unsuccessful.

10039-8{_}1739{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1740{_}I knew my Beauty had a thousand Darts, But knew not they cou'd strike so quick and home.

10039-8{_}1742{_}Let your good Wishes for your Friend alone, Lest he being happy, you shou'd be undone.
10039-8{_}1743{_}For he and you cannot be blest at once.

10039-8{_}1745{_}How, Madam!
10039-8{_}1746{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1747{_}I am that Maid he loves, and who hates him.

10039-8{_}1753{_}Oh, me unhappy!
10039-8{_}1754{_}[_Aside_.

10039-8{_}1756{_}He sighs and turns away--am I again defeated?
10039-8{_}1757{_}Surely I am not fair, or Man's insensible.
10039-8{_}1758{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1759{_}She knows me not-- And 'twas discreetly done to change my Shape: For Woman is a strange fantastick Creature; And where before, I cou'd not gain a Smile, Thus I may win her Heart.
10039-8{_}1760{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1761{_}--Say, Madam, can you love a Man that dies for you?
10039-8{_}1762{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1763{_}The way to gain me, is to fight with _Bellmour_.
10039-8{_}1764{_}Tell him from me you come, the wrong'd _Diana_; Tell him you have an Interest in my Heart, Equal to that which I have made in yours.
10039-8{_}1765{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1766{_}I'll do't; I will not ask your Reason, but obey.
10039-8{_}1767{_}Swear e'er I go, that when I have perform'd it, You'll render me Possession of your Heart.
10039-8{_}1768{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1769{_}By all the Vows that Heaven ties Hearts together with, I'll be entirely yours.
10039-8{_}1770{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1771{_}And I'll not be that conscientious Fool, To stop at Blessings 'cause they are not lawful; But take 'em up, when Heaven has thrown 'em down, Without the leave of a Religious Ceremony.
10039-8{_}1772{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1773{_}Madam, this House, which I am Master of, You shall command; whilst I go seek this _Bellmour_.
10039-8{_}1774{_}_Dia_.
10039-8{_}1775{_}But e'er you go, I must inform you why I do pursue him with my just Revenge.
10039-8{_}1776{_}_Friend_.
10039-8{_}1777{_}I will attend, and hear impatiently.

10039-8{_}1782{_}Driver _and_ Betty Flauntit.
10039-8{_}1783{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1784{_}_Driver_, prithee call for a Glass, that I may set my self in order, before I go up; for really my Knight has not been at home all this Night, and I am so confus'd--      _Enter one with a Glass, and two Wenches_, Jenny _and_ Doll.
10039-8{_}1785{_}Lord, Mrs. _Driver_, I wonder you shou'd send for me, when other Women are in Company; you know of all things in the World, I hate Whores, they are the pratingst leudest poor Creatures in Nature; and I wou'd not, for any thing, Sir _Timothy_ shou'd know that I keep Company, 'twere enough to lose him.
10039-8{_}1786{_}Mrs. _Driv_.
10039-8{_}1787{_}Truly, Mrs. _Flauntit_, this young Squire that you were Sent to for, has two or three Persons more with him that must be accommodated too.
10039-8{_}1788{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1789{_}_Driver_, though I do recreate my self a little sometimes, yet you know I value my Reputation and Honour.
10039-8{_}1790{_}_Jenny_.
10039-8{_}1791{_}Mrs. _Driver_, why shou'd you send for us where _Flauntit_ is?
10039-8{_}1792{_}a stinking proud Flirt, who because she has a tawdry Petticoat, I warrant you, will think her self so much above us, when if she were set out in her own natural Colours, and her original Garments, wou'd be much below us in Beauty.
10039-8{_}1793{_}Mrs. _Driv_.
10039-8{_}1794{_}Look ye, Mrs. _Jenny_, I know you, and I know Mrs. _Flauntit_; but 'tis not Beauty or Wit that takes now-a-days; the Age is altered since I took upon me this genteel Occupation: but 'tis a fine Petticoat, right Points, and clean Garnitures, that does me Credit, and takes the Gallant, though on a stale Woman.
10039-8{_}1795{_}And again, Mrs. _Jenny_, she's kept, and Men love as much for Malice, as for Lechery, as they call it.
10039-8{_}1796{_}Oh, 'tis a great Mover to Joy, as they say, to have a Woman that's kept.
10039-8{_}1797{_}_Jen_.
10039-8{_}1798{_}Well!
10039-8{_}1799{_}Be it so, we may arrive to that excellent Degree of Cracking, to be kept too one day.
10039-8{_}1800{_}Mrs. _Driv_.
10039-8{_}1801{_}Well, well, get your selves in order to go up to the Gentlemen.
10039-8{_}1802{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1803{_}_Driver_, what art thou talking to those poor Creatures?
10039-8{_}1804{_}Lord, how they stink of Paint and Pox, faugh--  Mrs. _Driv_.
10039-8{_}1805{_}They were only complaining that you that were kept, shou'd intrude upon the Privileges of the Commoners.
10039-8{_}1806{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1807{_}Lord, they think there are such Joys in Keeping, when I vow, _Driver_, after a while, a Miss has as painful a Life as a Wife; our Men drink, stay out late, and whore, like any Husbands.
10039-8{_}1808{_}_Driv_.
10039-8{_}1809{_}But I hope in the Lord, Mrs. _Flauntit_, yours is no such Man; I never saw him, but I have heard he's under decent Correction.
10039-8{_}1810{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1811{_}Thou art mistaken, _Driver_, I can keep him within no moderate Bounds without Blows; but for his filthy Custom of Wenching, I have almost broke him of that--but prithee, _Driver_, who are these Gentlemen?
10039-8{_}1812{_}_Driv_.
10039-8{_}1813{_}Truly, I know not; but they are young, and fine as Princes: two of 'em were disguis'd in masking Habits last Night, but they have sent 'em away this Morning, and they are free as Emperors--One of 'em has lost a Thousand Pound at Play, and never repin'd at it; one's a Knight, and I believe his Courage is cool'd, for he has ferreted my Maids over and over to Night--But 'tis the fine, young, handsom Squire that I design you for.
10039-8{_}1814{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1815{_}No matter for his Handsomness, let me have him that has most Money.
10039-8{_}1816{_}[_Exeunt_.
10039-8{_}1817{_}SCENE III.
10039-8{_}1818{_}_Another Chamber in the Brothel, a Table with Box and Dice_.
10039-8{_}1819{_}_Enter_ Bellmour, _Sir_ Timothy, Sham _and_ Sharp.
10039-8{_}1820{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1821{_}Damn it, give us more Wine.
10039-8{_}1822{_}[_Drinks_.
10039-8{_}1823{_}Where stands the Box and Dice?--Why, _Sham_.
10039-8{_}1824{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}1825{_}Faith, Sir, Your Luck's so bad, I han't the Conscience to play longer--Sir _Timothy_ and you play off a hundred Guineas, and see if Luck will turn.
10039-8{_}1826{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1827{_}Do you take me for a Country Squire, whose Reputation will be crackt at the loss of a petty Thousand?
10039-8{_}1828{_}You have my Note for it to my Goldsmith.
10039-8{_}1829{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}1830{_}'Tis sufficient if it were for ten thousand.
10039-8{_}1831{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1832{_}Why, Sir _Timothy_--Pox on't, thou'rt dull, we are not half debauch'd and leud enough, give us more Wine.
10039-8{_}1833{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1834{_}Faith, _Frank_, I'm a little maukish with sitting up all Night, and want a small refreshment this Morning--Did we not send for Whores?
10039-8{_}1835{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1836{_}No, I am not in humour for a Wench-- By Heaven, I hate the Sex.
10039-8{_}1837{_}All but divine _Celinda_, Appear strange Monsters to my Eyes and Thoughts.
10039-8{_}1838{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1839{_}What, art Italianiz'd, and lovest thy own Sex?
10039-8{_}1840{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1841{_}I'm for any thing that's out of the common Road of Sin; I love a Man that will be damn'd for something: to creep by slow degrees to Hell, as if he were afraid the World shou'd see which way he went, I scorn it, 'tis like a Conventicler--No, give me a Man, who to be certain of's Damnation, will break a solemn Vow to a contracted Maid.
10039-8{_}1842{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1843{_}Ha, ha, ha, I thought thou would'st have said at least--had murder'd his Father, or ravish'd his Mother--Break a Vow, quoth ye--by Fortune, I have broke a thousand.
10039-8{_}1844{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1845{_}Well said, my Boy!
10039-8{_}1846{_}A Man of Honour!
10039-8{_}1847{_}And will be ready whene'er the Devil calls for thee--So--ho--more Wine, more Wine, and Dice.
10039-8{_}1848{_}_Enter a Servant with Dice and Wine_.
10039-8{_}1849{_}Come, Sir, let me--                        [_Throws and loses_.
10039-8{_}1850{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1851{_}What will you set me, Sir?
10039-8{_}1852{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1853{_}Cater-tray--a hundred Guineas--oh, damn the Dice--'tis mine--come, a full Glass--Damnation to my Uncle.
10039-8{_}1854{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1855{_}By Fortune, I'll do thee reason--give me the Glass, and, _Sham_, to thee--Confusion to the musty Lord.
10039-8{_}1856{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1857{_}So--now I'm like my self, profanely wicked.
10039-8{_}1858{_}A little room for Life--but such a Life As Hell it self shall wonder at--I'll have a care To do no one good deed in the whole course on't, Lest that shou'd save my Soul in spite of Vow-breach.
10039-8{_}1859{_}--I will not die--that Peace my Sins deserve not.
10039-8{_}1860{_}I'll live and let my Tyrant Uncle see The sad effects of Perjury, and forc'd Marriage.
10039-8{_}1861{_}--Surely the Pow'rs above envy'd my Bliss; Marrying _Celinda_, I had been an Angel, So truly blest, and good.
10039-8{_}1862{_}[_Weeps_.
10039-8{_}1863{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1864{_}Why, how now, _Frank_--by Fortune, the Rogue is Maudlin--So, ho, ho, so ho.
10039-8{_}1865{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1866{_}The matter?
10039-8{_}1867{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1868{_}Oh, art awake--What a Devil ail'st thou, _Frank_?
10039-8{_}1869{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1870{_}A Wench, or any thing--come, let's drink a round.
10039-8{_}1871{_}_Sham_.
10039-8{_}1872{_}They're come as wisht for.
10039-8{_}1873{_}_Enter_ Flauntit, Driver, Doll _and_ Jenny _mask'd_.
10039-8{_}1874{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1875{_}Oh, damn 'em!
10039-8{_}1876{_}What shall I do?
10039-8{_}1877{_}Yet it would look like Virtue to avoid 'em.
10039-8{_}1878{_}No, I must venture on--Ladies, y'are welcome.
10039-8{_}1879{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1880{_}How, the Women?--Hold, hold, _Bellmour_, let me choose too-- Come, come, unmask, and shew your pretty Faces.
10039-8{_}1881{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1882{_}How, Sir _Timothy_!
10039-8{_}1883{_}What Devil ow'd me a spite.
10039-8{_}1884{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1885{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1886{_}Come, unmask, I say: a willing Wench would have shew'd all in half this time.
10039-8{_}1887{_}_Flaunt_.

10039-8{_}1893{_}This is the Trade you drive, you eternal Fop, when I sit at home expecting you Night after Night.
10039-8{_}1894{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1895{_}Nay, dear Betty!
10039-8{_}1896{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1897{_}'Tis here you spend that which shou'd buy me Points and Petticoats, whilst I go like no body's Mistress; I'd as live be your Wife at this rate, so I had: and I'm in no small danger of getting the foul Disease by your Leudness.
10039-8{_}1898{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1899{_}Victorious _Betty_, be merciful, and do not ruin my Reputation amongst my Friends.

10039-8{_}1903{_}Nay, triumphant _Betty_, hear thy poor _Timmy_.
10039-8{_}1904{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1905{_}My poor _Ninny_, I'm us'd barbarously, and won't endure it.
10039-8{_}1906{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1907{_}I've won Money to Night, _Betty_, to buy thee Clothes--hum --hum--Well said, _Frank_, towse the little Jilts, they came for that purpose.
10039-8{_}1908{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1909{_}The Devil confound him, what a Prize have I lost by his being here--my Comfort is, he has not found me out though, but thinks I came to look for him, and accordingly I must dissemble.
10039-8{_}1910{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1911{_}What's here?
10039-8{_}1912{_}A Lady all in Tears!
10039-8{_}1913{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1914{_}An old Acquaintance of mine, that takes it unkindly that I am for Change--_Betty_, say so too, you know I can settle nothing till I'm marry'd; and he can do it swingingly, if we can but draw him in.
10039-8{_}1915{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1916{_}This mollifies something, do this, and you'll make your Peace; if not, you Rascal, your Ears shall pay for this Night's Transgression.
10039-8{_}1917{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1918{_}Come hither, _Frank_, is not this a fine Creature?
10039-8{_}1919{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1920{_}By Heaven, a very Devil!
10039-8{_}1921{_}Sir _Tim_.
10039-8{_}1922{_}Come, come, approach her; for if you'll have a Miss, this has all the good Qualities of one--go, go Court her, thou art so bashful--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}1923{_}I cannot frame my Tongue to so much Blasphemy, as 'tis to say kind things to her--I'll try my Heart though--Fair Lady--Damn her, she is not fair--nor sweet--nor good--nor--something I must say for a beginning.
10039-8{_}1924{_}Come, Lady--dry your Eyes: This Man deserves not all the Tears you shed.
10039-8{_}1925{_}--So--at last the Devil has got the better of me, And I am enter'd.
10039-8{_}1926{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1927{_}You see, Sir, how miserable we Women are that love you Men.
10039-8{_}1928{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1929{_}How, did you love him?
10039-8{_}1930{_}Love him against his Will?
10039-8{_}1931{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1932{_}So it seems, Sir.
10039-8{_}1933{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1934{_}Oh, thou art wretched then indeed; no wonder if he hate thee-- Does he not curse thee?
10039-8{_}1935{_}Curse thee till thou art damn'd, as I do lost _Diana_.

10039-8{_}1941{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}1942{_}Gods!
10039-8{_}1943{_}what an odious thing mere Coupling is!
10039-8{_}1944{_}A thing which every sensual Animal Can do as well as we--but prithee tell me, Is there nought else between the nobler Creatures?
10039-8{_}1945{_}_Flaunt_.
10039-8{_}1946{_}Not that I know of, Sir-- Lord, he's very silly, or very innocent, I hope he has his Maidenhead; if so, and rich too.

10039-8{_}1948{_}[_Aside_.
10039-8{_}1949{_}_Bel_.

10039-8{_}1974{_}For I am very apt to learn of Beauty--Gods-- What is't I negotiate for?--a Woman!

10039-8{_}1994{_}Ay, ay, silly indeed--a Pox upon her--a silly Knight, you say--  _Driv_.

10039-8{_}2006{_}_Driv_.
10039-8{_}2007{_}She cries Whore first, brings him upon his Knees for her Fault; and a piece of Plate, or a new Petticoat, makes his Peace again.

10039-8{_}2852{_}_Sir_ Timothy, _Gallants, at last is come To know his Sentence, and receive his Doom, But pray before you are resolv'd to be Severe, look on your selves, and then on me; Observe me well, I am a Man of Show, Of Noise, and Nonsense, as are most of you.
10039-8{_}2853{_}Though all of you don't share with me in Title, In Character you differ very little.
10039-8{_}2854{_}Tell me in what you find a Difference?
10039-8{_}2855{_}It may be you will say, you're Men of Sense; But Faith-- Were one of you o'th' Stage, and I i'th' Pit, He might be thought the Fop, and I the Wit.
10039-8{_}2856{_}On equal Grounds you'll scarce know one from t'other; We are as like, as Brother is to Brother.
10039-8{_}2857{_}To judge against me then wou'd be Ill-Nature, For Men are kind to those they're like in Feature.
10039-8{_}2858{_}For Judges therefore I accept you all; By you, Sir_ Timothy _will stand or fall.
10039-8{_}2859{_}He's too faint-hearted that his Sentence fears, Who has the Honour to be try'd by's Peers_.
10039-8{_}2860{_}Written by Mr. _E.R_.
10039-8{_}2861{_}THE FALSE COUNT.
10039-8{_}2862{_}ARGUMENT.
10039-8{_}2863{_}Don Carlos, Governor of Cadiz, who has been contracted to Julia, now married to a rich old churl, Francisco, in order to gain her, mans a galley, which has been captured from the Turks, with some forty or fifty attendants disguised as ferocious Ottomans; and whilst she, her husband and a party of friends are taking a pleasure trip in a yacht, they are suddenly boarded and all made prisoners by the supposed corsairs, who carry them off to a country villa a few miles from the town belonging to Carlos' friend, Antonio, which, however, they are firmly convinc'd is a palace inhabited by the Great Turk himself.
10039-8{_}2864{_}Here Carlos appears, dressed as the Sultan, with much pomp, and Francisco, overwhelmed with terror, speedily relinquishes Julia to his captor.
10039-8{_}2865{_}In order to punish her for her intolerable arrogance, Isabella, Francisco's daughter by his former wife, who is designed to wed Antonio, is introduced to a chimney-sweep, Guiliom, masquerading as a noble of high degree.
10039-8{_}2866{_}She forthwith strikes up a match with the False Count, leaving Antonio free to marry Clara, Julia's sister, whom he loves.
10039-8{_}2867{_}No sooner, however, has the knot been securely tied than Guiliom, appearing in his sooty rags and with smutched face, publicly demands and humiliates his haughty bride.
10039-8{_}2868{_}The trick of the feigned Turks is discovered by the arrival at the villa of Baltazer, Julia's father.
10039-8{_}2869{_}Don Carlos, however, claims his mistress by reason of his former contract, which is perforce allowed.
10039-8{_}2870{_}SOURCE.
10039-8{_}2871{_}Guiliom, masquerading as a Count, is of course directly derived from _Les Précieuses Ridicules_, first performed 18 November, 1659, and Isabella is a close copy of Cathos and Magdelon.
10039-8{_}2872{_}Flecknoe had already adapted Molière in _The Damoiselles à la Mode_, unacted (4to 1667); and seven years later than Mrs. Behn, Shadwell, in his fine comedy, _Bury Fair_ (1689), drew largely from the same source.
10039-8{_}2873{_}His mock noble is a French peruke-maker, La Roch, who marries Lady Fantast's affected daughter.
10039-8{_}2874{_}Miller, in his _The Man of Taste; or, The Guardian_ (1735), blended the same plot with _L'Ecole des Maris_.
10039-8{_}2875{_}The stratagem of the feigned Turkish ship capturing the yacht is a happy extension of a hint from the famous galley scene (Que diable allait-il faire à cette galère?
10039-8{_}2876{_}), Act ii, 7, _Les Fourberies de Scapin_.
10039-8{_}2877{_}This, however, is not original with Molière, being entirely borrowed from _Le Pédant Joué_, Act ii, 4, of Cyrano de Bergerac (1654).
10039-8{_}2878{_}What is practically a translation of _Les Fourberies de Scapin_ by Otway, was produced at the Duke's Theatre in 1677, and in the same year Ravenscroft included a great part of it in his _Scaramouch a Philosopher, Harlequin a Schoolboy, Bravo, Merchant, and Magician_.
10039-8{_}2879{_}In the Epilogue Mrs. Behn asserts that she wrote _The False Count_ with ease in something less than a week.
10039-8{_}2880{_}This may be a pardonable exaggeration; but there are certainly distinct marks of haste in the composition of the play.
10039-8{_}2881{_}In Act iii, I, she evidently intended Francisco and his party to be seized as they were returning home by sea, at the end of the act she arranges their sea trip as an excursion on a yacht.
10039-8{_}2882{_}THEATRICAL HISTORY.
10039-8{_}2883{_}_The False Count; or, A New Way to Play an Old Game_ was produced at the Duke's Theatre, Dorset Garden, in the autumn of 1682, not later than the end of October.
10039-8{_}2884{_}An excellent rattling farce, it seems to have kept the stage at intervals for some twenty years.
10039-8{_}2885{_}On 11 August, 1715, there was a revival at Lincoln's Inn Fields.
10039-8{_}2886{_}It is billed as 'not acted ten years'.
10039-8{_}2887{_}Spiller played Guiliom, Mrs. Moor Isabella, and Mrs. Thurmond Julia.
10039-8{_}2888{_}There is no further record of its performance.
10039-8{_}2889{_}THE FALSE COUNT: or, A New Way to play an old Game.
10039-8{_}2890{_}PROLOGUE.
10039-8{_}2891{_}Spoken by Mr. _Smith_.
10039-8{_}2892{_}_Know all ye Whigs and Tories of the Pit, (Ye furious Guelphs and Gibelins of Wit, Who for the Cause, and Crimes of Forty One So furiously maintain the Quarrel on) Our Author, as you'll find it writ in Story, Has hitherto been a most wicked Tory; But now, to th'joy o'th' Brethren be it spoken, Our Sister's vain mistaken Eyes are open; And wisely valuing her dear Interest now, All-powerful Whigs, converted is to you.
10039-8{_}2893{_}'Twas long she did maintain the Royal Cause, Argu'd, disputed, rail'd with great Applause; Writ Madrigals and Doggerel on the Times, And charg'd you all with your Fore-fathers Crimes; Nay, confidently swore no Plot was true, But that so slily carried on by you: Raised horrid Scandals on you, hellish Stories, In Conventicles how you eat young Tories; As_ Jew _did heretofore eat_ Christian _Suckling; And brought an _Odium_ on your pious Gutling: When this is all Malice it self can say, You for the good Old Cause devoutly eat and pray.
10039-8{_}2894{_}Though this one Text were able to convert ye, Ye needy Tribe of Scriblers to the Party; Yet there are more advantages than these, For write, invent, and make what Plots you please, The wicked Party keep your Witnesses; Like frugal Cuckold-makers you beget Brats that secur'd by others fires shall sit.
10039-8{_}2895{_}Your Conventicling Miracles out-do All that the Whore of_ Babylon _e'er knew: By wondrous art you make Rogues honest Men, And when you please transform 'em Rogues again.
10039-8{_}2896{_}To day a Saint, if he but hang a Papist, Peach a true Protestant, your Saint's turn'd Atheist: And dying Sacraments do less prevail, Than living ones, though took in Lamb's-Wool-Ale.
10039-8{_}2897{_}Who wou'd not then be for a Common-weal, To have the Villain covered with his Zeal?
10039-8{_}2898{_}A Zeal, who for Convenience can dispense With Plays provided there's no Wit nor Sense.
10039-8{_}2899{_}For Wit's profane, and Jesuitical, And Plotting's Popery, and the Devil and all.
10039-8{_}2900{_}We then have fitted you with one to day, 'Tis writ as 'twere a Recantation Play; Renouncing all that has pretence to witty, T'oblige the Reverend_ Brumighams _o'th' City: No smutty Scenes, no Jests to move your Laughter, Nor Love that so debauches all your Daughters.
10039-8{_}2901{_}But shou'd the Torys now,--who will desert me, Because they find no dry bobs on your Party, Resolve to hiss, as late did Popish Crew,        | By Yea and Nay, she'll throw her self on you,    | The grand Inquest of Whigs, to whom she's true.
10039-8{_}2902{_}| Then let 'em rail and hiss, and damn their fill, Your Verdict will be_ Ignoramus _still_.

10039-8{_}2925{_}SCENE I.
10039-8{_}2926{_}_The Street_.
10039-8{_}2927{_}_Enter_ Carlos, Antonio _and_ Guzman.
10039-8{_}2928{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2929{_}By all that's good, I'm mad, stark raving mad, To have a Woman young, rich, beautiful, Just on the point of yielding to my Love, Snatcht from my Arms by such a Beast as this; An old ridiculous Buffoon, past Pleasure, Past Love, or any thing that tends that way; Ill-favour'd, ill-bred, and ill-qualify'd, With more Diseases than a Horse past Service; And only blest with Fortune and my _Julia_; For him, I say, this Miser, to obtain her, After my tedious nights and days of Love, My midnight Watchings, Quarrels, Wounds and Dangers; --My Person not unhandsom too, By Heav'n, 'twas wondrous strange!
10039-8{_}2930{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2931{_}And old _Francisco_, without the expence of an hour's Courtship, a _Billet-Doux_, or scarce a sight of her, could gain her in a day; and yet 'tis wonder, your Fortune and your Quality, should be refus'd by Don _Baltazer_ her Father.
10039-8{_}2932{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2933{_}A Pox upon't, I went the wrong way to work, and courted the Daughter; but indeed my Father, the late Governour of _Cadiz_, whose Estate and Honour I now enjoy, was then living; and, fearing he would not consent to my Passion, I endeavoured to keep it secret, though sacred Vows had past between us two.
10039-8{_}2934{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2935{_}Did she not tell you of this Marriage with old _Francisco_?
10039-8{_}2936{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2937{_}The night before, she did; but only by a Letter from her Window dropt; which when by the help of a dark Lanthorn, I had read, I was struck dead with Grief.
10039-8{_}2938{_}[_Gives him the Letter_.
10039-8{_}2939{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2940{_}[reads.]
10039-8{_}2941{_}_Expect to morrow night to hear I'm dead, since the next   Sun will guide me to a fatal Marriage with old_ Francisco.
10039-8{_}2942{_}_Your_ Julia.
10039-8{_}2943{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2944{_}Judge, dear _Antonio_, my Surprize and Grief; A-while I stood unmov'd, thoughtless, and silent, But soon Rage wak'd me to new Life again; But what I said and did, I leave to raging Lovers, Like disappointed me, to guess and judge; She heard--and only answer'd me in Tears, Nor could I beg one tender Word from her, She sigh'd, and shut the Window too, and vanish'd.
10039-8{_}2945{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2946{_}And she accordingly next day was married.
10039-8{_}2947{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2948{_}She was--and I have since endeavoured all the Arts and Ways I can to cuckold him; 'tis now two months since the Wedding, and I hear he keeps her as close as a Relict, jealous as Age and Impotence can make him.
10039-8{_}2949{_}She hitherto has been absent at _Sevil_, but Expectation of her Daughter-in-law's Wedding with you has brought 'em hither,--and, I ask your Pardon, _Antonio_, for raillying your Father-in-law that shall be, old _Francisco_.
10039-8{_}2950{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2951{_}I hope you are mistaken, Sir.
10039-8{_}2952{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2953{_}How, are you not to marry his Daughter, _Isabella_?
10039-8{_}2954{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2955{_}Not if I can help it, Sir,--the Honour you have done me in your Friendship to me, a Person so much above me in Title and Birth, makes me think it my Duty to conceal no part of my Heart to you,--Know then this _Isabella_, Daughter to old _Francisco_, and your Cuckold that shall be I hope, is, though fair, most ridiculously proud, vain and fantastical; as all of her Birth and Education, grown rich, are.
10039-8{_}2956{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2957{_}Prithee, what was her Birth?
10039-8{_}2958{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2959{_}Why, her Father, old _Francisco_, was in his youth an English Cordwainer, that is to say, a Shoemaker, which he improv'd in time to a Merchant; and the Devil and his Knavery helping him to a considerable Estate, he set up for Gentleman; and being naturally a stingey, hide-bound Rascal, and in the Humour of Jealousy even out-doing the most rigid of us _Spaniards_, he came over into _Spain_, to settle with his whole Family, where his Wife dying, to heighten the Vice, marries this young _Julia_, your Mistress, Sir;--and now this Daughter of his having wholly forgot her original Dunghill, sets up for a Viscountess at least, though her Father has design'd me the Blessing; but I have fixt my Heart and Eyes else-where, _Clara_, the young Sister of your Mistress, Sir, commands my Liberty.
10039-8{_}2960{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2961{_}I've seen her, she has Youth and Beauty capable to make a Conquest any where,--but does she know your Love?
10039-8{_}2962{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2963{_}She does, and makes me think my Love return'd.
10039-8{_}2964{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2965{_}Then know, _Antonio_, I must be your Rival.
10039-8{_}2966{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2967{_}How, Sir!
10039-8{_}2968{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2969{_}You said but now you were my Friend, _Antonio_; If true, you must assist in my design.
10039-8{_}2970{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2971{_}I listen, Sir, impatiently.
10039-8{_}2972{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2973{_}Then thus; before I knew she was your Mistress, I had resolv'd upon Addresses to her, in order to't, have treated with her Father about a Marriage.
10039-8{_}2974{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2975{_}How!
10039-8{_}2976{_}and wou'd the false, forsworn, receive your Vows?
10039-8{_}2977{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2978{_}No; but with Tears implores her Father daily, whene'er he speaks to her about my Passion; nor can I undeceive her, for indeed I have but feign'd a Love, (she living in the same house with _Julia_ whilst here at _Cadiz_) to get an opportunity with that dear, charming Creature; for, coming as a Brother, sure they'll admit me kindly; nor will _Francisco_, who has heard of what has past 'twixt me and _Julia_, suspect me any more.
10039-8{_}2979{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2980{_}I knew I had a Rival, Sir, whom _Clara_ lov'd not; but ne'er cou'd get it from her who he was, for fear of mischief: I have often the Liberty to see her, under the name and pretence of _Isabella's_ Lover.
10039-8{_}2981{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2982{_}And I visit her only to get a sight of _Julia_, which hitherto has been impossible, though I have oft endeavour'd it.
10039-8{_}2983{_}I beg you'll not be jealous; for this, by Heav'n, is only my Design.
10039-8{_}2984{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2985{_}I'll trust my Life, my Honour and my Mistress in so good hands at any time.
10039-8{_}2986{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2987{_}You oblige me; but though I find your _Clara_ cold and cruel, _Isabella_ would invite me to her Love, and makes so many kind advances to me--  _Ant_.
10039-8{_}2988{_}So would she for your Title, were you deform'd, and had no shape of Man about you; but me, because a little Citizen and Merchant, she so reviles, calling me base Mechanick, saucy Fellow; and wonders where I got the Impudence to speak of Love to her--in fine, I am resolved to be reveng'd on all her Pride and Scorn; by Heav'n, I will invent some dire Revenge:--I'm bent upon't, and will about it instantly.
10039-8{_}2989{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2990{_}And would you do it home and handsomly, and have a good occasion of being disengaged from her, and make her self the instrument?
10039-8{_}2991{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2992{_}Ay, such a Plot were worth the Prosecution.
10039-8{_}2993{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2994{_}And such a one I have in my head: _Guzman_, my Servant, knows a fellow here in _Cadiz_, whom for his pleasant humour I have oft observ'd, as I have past the Streets, but too mean to be convers'd with, by almost any human thing, by Trade a Chimney-Sweeper.
10039-8{_}2995{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}2996{_}On, Sir, I beseech you.
10039-8{_}2997{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}2998{_}This Fellow's of a quick Wit and good Apprehension, though possibly he cannot act the Don so well, yet that which makes up the best part of our young Gallants now a-days, he shall not want; that is, good Clothes, Money, and an Equipage,--and a little Instruction will serve turn.
10039-8{_}2999{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3000{_}I'm ravisht with the Fancy;--let me see--he shall be an _English_ Lord, or a _French_ Count.
10039-8{_}3001{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3002{_}Either, we'll furnish him with Bills on Signior Don _Francisco_, --Men and Baggage, and the business is done--he shall make Love to her.
10039-8{_}3003{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3004{_}Most excellent.
10039-8{_}3005{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3006{_}_Guzman_, have you not observ'd this Fellow I am speaking of.
10039-8{_}3007{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3008{_}Observ'd him, Sir!
10039-8{_}3009{_}I know him particularly, I'll fetch him to you now, Sir; he always stands for new Imployment with the rest of his Gang under St. _Jago's_ Church-wall.
10039-8{_}3010{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3011{_}Bring him anon to my Lodgings, where we'll prepare him for the Adventure.
10039-8{_}3012{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3013{_}And if the proud _Isabella_ bite not at so gay a bait, I'll be bound to be married to her.
10039-8{_}3014{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3015{_}And if she do not, possibly that may be your Fate--but in return, you must let _Clara_ know the Design I have, and, undeceiving her opinion of my Love, make her of our Party.
10039-8{_}3016{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3017{_}Trust my Friendship, Sir, and Management.
10039-8{_}3018{_}I'll to her instantly, that is, make a visit to _Isabella_, and get an opportunity to speak with _Clara_.
10039-8{_}3019{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3020{_}And I must write a Letter to _Julia_, to undeceive her Fears too, could I but get it to her.
10039-8{_}3021{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3022{_}For that let me alone.
10039-8{_}3023{_}[_Exeunt severally, bowing_.

10039-8{_}3025{_}_A Chamber_.
10039-8{_}3026{_}_Enter_ Julia _and_ Jacinta.
10039-8{_}3027{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3028{_}Lord, Madam, you are as melancholy as a sick Parrot.
10039-8{_}3029{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3030{_}And can you blame me, _Jacinta_?
10039-8{_}3031{_}have I not many Reasons to be sad?
10039-8{_}3032{_}first have I not lost the only Man on earth in Don _Carlos_, that I cou'd love?
10039-8{_}3033{_}and worse than that, am married to a Thing, fit only for his Tomb; a Brute, who wanting sense to value me, treats me more like a Prisoner than a Wife?--and his Pretence is, because I should not see nor hear from Don _Carlos_.
10039-8{_}3034{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3035{_}Wou'd I were in your room, Madam, I'd cut him out work enough, I'd warrant him; and if he durst impose on me, i'faith, I'd transform both his Shape and his Manners; in short, I'd try what Woman-hood cou'd do.
10039-8{_}3036{_}And indeed, the Revenge wou'd be so pleasant, I wou'd not be without a jealous Husband for all the World; and really, Madam, Don _Carlos_ is so sweet a Gentleman.
10039-8{_}3037{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3038{_}Ay, but the Sin, _Jacinta_!
10039-8{_}3039{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3040{_}O' my Conscience, Heav'n wou'd forgive it; for this match of yours, with old _Francisco_, was never made there.

10039-8{_}3042{_}Then if I wou'd, alas, what opportunities have I, for I confess since his first Vows made him mine--  _Jac_.
10039-8{_}3043{_}Right--that lying with old _Francisco_ is flat Adultery.
10039-8{_}3044{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3045{_}I might, with some excuse, give my self away to _Carlos_--But oh, he's false, he takes unjustly all the Vows he paid me, and gives 'em to my Sister _Clara_ now.
10039-8{_}3046{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3047{_}Indeed that's something uncivil, Madam, if it be true.
10039-8{_}3048{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3049{_}True!
10039-8{_}3050{_}my Father has with joy consented to it, and he has leave to visit her; and can I live to see't?
10039-8{_}3051{_}No, Mischief will ensue, my Love's too high, too nicely true to brook Affronts like that.
10039-8{_}3052{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3053{_}Yet you first broke with him.
10039-8{_}3054{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3055{_}Not I; be witness, Heav'n, with what reluctancy I forc'd my breaking heart; and can I see that charming Body in my Sister's Arms!
10039-8{_}3056{_}that Mouth that has so oft sworn Love to me kist by another's Lips!
10039-8{_}3057{_}no, _Jacinta_, that night that gives him to another Woman, shall see him dead between the Charmer's Arms.
10039-8{_}3058{_}My Life I hate, and when I live no more for _Carlos_, I'll cease to be at all; it is resolv'd.
10039-8{_}3059{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3060{_}Faith, Madam, I hope to live to see a more comical end of your Amours--but see where your amiable Spouse comes with Don _Baltazer_ your Father.
10039-8{_}3061{_}_Enter_ Francisco _and_ Baltazer.
10039-8{_}3062{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3063{_}So--you two are damnable close together, 'tis for no goodness I'll warrant, you have your trade betimes.
10039-8{_}3064{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3065{_}Meaning me, Sir?
10039-8{_}3066{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3067{_}Yes, you, one of my Wife's evil Counsellors,--go, get you up both to your respective Chambers, go--                                   [_Ex.
10039-8{_}3068{_}both_.
10039-8{_}3069{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3070{_}Barring your Compliments, good Son, give me leave to speak.
10039-8{_}3071{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3072{_}Shaw, I know as well as your self what you wou'd say now; you wou'd assure me I am sole Master of your House, and may command; that you are heartily glad to see me at _Cadiz_, and that you desire I wou'd resolve upon a Week's stay, or so; that you'll spare nothing for my entertainment: why, I know all this, and therefore pray take my word, good Father-in-Law, without any more ado.
10039-8{_}3073{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3074{_}Well, Sir, pray answer me one question, what drew you to _Cadiz_?
10039-8{_}3075{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3076{_}Why, I'll tell you; in the first place, a Pox of all Lovers, I say; for my Daughter _Isabella_ is to be married, as you know, to _Antonio_, a young rich Merchant of this Town; in the second place, my Wife, with a Vengeance, must be gadding to visit you and her Sister, whom we heard also was to be married to the young Governor Don _Carlos_; 'tis shreudly against my will, Heav'n knows, for my Wits are in an uproar already about this business--your Gallants, Father, your young Gallants,--I wish my Wife were secure at home again.
10039-8{_}3077{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3078{_}Pray, why so?
10039-8{_}3079{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3080{_}Alas, I see the Trick, Sir, a mere Trick put upon a Man, a married Man, and a married Man to a handsome young Woman,--you apprehend me.
10039-8{_}3081{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3082{_}Not I, Sir.
10039-8{_}3083{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3084{_}Not you, Sir!
10039-8{_}3085{_}why, look ye, your young Governor who now is, made most desperate love to her who is now my Wife, d'ye mind me?--but you, being a Man of an exact Judgment, to her great grief, gave her to me, who best deserv'd her, both for my civil Behaviour, and comely Personage, d'ye understand me?
10039-8{_}3086{_}but now this _Carlos_, by his Father's death, being made Governor, d'ye see?
10039-8{_}3087{_}is to marry me your other daughter _Clara_, and to exasperate me, wou'd never let me be at quiet till he had got both of us hither to _Cadiz_, to grace his Wedding; a Pox of his Invitation, was I so civil to invite him to mine?
10039-8{_}3088{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3089{_}If this be your Affliction, you may avoid it.
10039-8{_}3090{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3091{_}No, no, I'll try to force Nature a little, and be civil, or so; but as soon as the Ceremony's over, I'll steal out of Town, whip a way, presto, i'faith.
10039-8{_}3092{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3093{_}But shou'd you do so rude a thing to your new Brother, your Wife wou'd think you were jealous of her.
10039-8{_}3094{_}No, dissemble that Fault, I beseech you, 'twill make you odious to her and all the world, when 'tis needless, 'tis natural for Women to hate what they fear.
10039-8{_}3095{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3096{_}Say you so, then I will hide it as much as I can in words, I can dissemble too upon occasion.
10039-8{_}3097{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3098{_}Let her remain awhile amongst us.
10039-8{_}3099{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3100{_}The Devil a bit she shall, good Father mine, no, no, I have more years than you, Sir Father, and understand what Women are, especially when married to ancient Men, and have the Conversation of young Men--whose Eyes like Basilisks destroy Modesty with looking on 'em; the very Thought on't has rais'd a Bump in my Forehead already.
10039-8{_}3101{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3102{_}I am sorry you should suspect my Daughter's Virtue.
10039-8{_}3103{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3104{_}May be you are, Sir--but Youth you know-- Opportunity--Occasion--or so--there are Winks, and Nods, and Signs, and Twirs--and--well--in short I am satisfied, and they that are not may go whistle: and so I'll to my Wife, whom I have left too long alone, evil thoughts will grow upon her--Wife, Love--Duckling--                                              [_Calls her_.
10039-8{_}3105{_}_Enter_ Julia _and_ Jacinta.
10039-8{_}3106{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3107{_}Wou'd I had never married her to this Sot.
10039-8{_}3108{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3109{_}Your pleasure, Sir.
10039-8{_}3110{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3111{_}Only to see thee, Love.
10039-8{_}3112{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3113{_}I have a Suit to you.
10039-8{_}3114{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3115{_}What is't, my Chicken.
10039-8{_}3116{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3117{_}I wou'd go make a Visit to my Aunt, my Sister _Clara's_ there, and I'll go fetch her home.
10039-8{_}3118{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3119{_}Hum--perhaps the Governor's there too?
10039-8{_}3120{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3121{_}What if he be?
10039-8{_}3122{_}we ought to make him a visit too, who so kindly sent for us to _Cadiz_.
10039-8{_}3123{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3124{_}How!
10039-8{_}3125{_}Make a visit to the Governor?
10039-8{_}3126{_}What have I to do with the Governor, or what have you to do with the Governor?
10039-8{_}3127{_}you are no Soldier, Love.
10039-8{_}3128{_}As for a Visit to your Aunt, there's some reason in't; but for the Governor, think no more upon him, I say no more.
10039-8{_}3129{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3130{_}Since he's to marry my Sister, why shou'd you refuse him that Civility.
10039-8{_}3131{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3132{_}Your Sister, so much the worse.
10039-8{_}3133{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3134{_}So much the worse?
10039-8{_}3135{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3136{_}I, so much the worse, I tell you; for mark me, you have been Lovers lately; and old Stories may arise that are not yet forgotten; and having under the Cloke of a Husband both Sisters at command, one for a Wife, t'other for a Mistress, hoyte toyte, there will be mad work, i'faith; What a mixture of Brother by the Father's side, and Uncle by the Mother's side there will be; Aunt by the Mother's side, and Sister by the Father's side; a man may find as good kindred amongst a kennel of Beagles.--No, no, no Visits to the Governor, I beseech you, fair Madam.
10039-8{_}3137{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3138{_}So, you are at your Jealousy again.
10039-8{_}3139{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3140{_}Come, come, I love plain dealing; besides, when she named the Governor, Flesh and Blood could not contain.
10039-8{_}3141{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3142{_}I spoke in reference to his Quality.
10039-8{_}3143{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3144{_}A Pox of your Civility; I tell you, I scorn my Wife should be civil.
10039-8{_}3145{_}Why, what a Coil's here about a Governor!
10039-8{_}3146{_}I'll stand to't, a Man had better have a Mule to his Wife than a Woman, and 'twere easier govern'd.
10039-8{_}3147{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3148{_}But hear reason, Son.
10039-8{_}3149{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3150{_}What, from a Woman and a Wife?
10039-8{_}3151{_}Lord, Lord, where are your Wits, good Father-in-Law?
10039-8{_}3152{_}Why, what a Devil, shall I be made ridiculous, a Coxcomb, Cuckold, to shew my Wife?
10039-8{_}3153{_}No, no, there's no Necessity of your Civility, Mistress; leave that to me who understand the due Punctilios of it.
10039-8{_}3154{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3155{_}Harkye, Son, Harkye!
10039-8{_}3156{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3157{_}Father mine, every Man to his business, I say, therefore say no more of this; for I'll give my Mother's Son to the Devil, when any Wife of mine ever makes a Visit to the Governor; and there's an end on't.
10039-8{_}3158{_}Was ever so horrid a Plot contriv'd against her own lawful Husband?
10039-8{_}3159{_}Visit the Governor with a Pox!
10039-8{_}3160{_}_Bal_.
10039-8{_}3161{_}'Tis an Honour due to all Men of his Rank.
10039-8{_}3162{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3163{_}I care not for that, my opinion is, my Wife's my Slave, and let him keep his Rank to himself.

10039-8{_}3169{_}That I am in health,--very well, I was afraid he wou'd have been harping upon my Wife in the first place--the Devil take her, she looks for't.

10039-8{_}3171{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3172{_}Farther, Sir, he kisses your hand, with a more than ordinary friendship.
10039-8{_}3173{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3174{_}A Pox of his Compliments.--    [_Aside_.
10039-8{_}3175{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3176{_}But he charg'd me, Sir, most passionately to present his Service to your Lady.
10039-8{_}3177{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3178{_}Yes, yes; I thought as much.
10039-8{_}3179{_}_Guz_.--In a more particular manner.
10039-8{_}3180{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3181{_}Friend, my Wife, or Lady, has no need of his Service in a more particular manner, and so you may return it.
10039-8{_}3182{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3183{_}Indeed, but she has great need of his service in a very particular manner.
10039-8{_}3184{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3185{_}Sir, I meant no hurt, but 'tis always the fashion of your true bred Courtier, to be more ceremonious in his Civilities to Ladies than Men;--and he desires to know how she does.
10039-8{_}3186{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3187{_}How strong this _Carlos_ smells of the Devil--Friend, tell your Master she's very well, but since she was married, she has forgot her gentile Civility and good Manners, and never returns any Compliments to Men.
10039-8{_}3188{_}_Guz_.--How shall I get it to her?--Sir, the Governor hopes he shall have the honour of entertaining you both at his House.
10039-8{_}3189{_}He's impatient of your coming, and waits at home on purpose.
10039-8{_}3190{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3191{_}Friend, let your Master know we are here in very good quarters already, and he does us both too much honour; and that if we have notice of the Wedding-day, and I have nothing else to do, we'll certainly wait on him, and the next morning we intend to take our leaves, which I send him word of beforehand to prevent surprize.
10039-8{_}3192{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3193{_}But, Sir--              [_Approaching him, he puts his Wife farther_.
10039-8{_}3194{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3195{_}Go, Sir, and deliver your Message.
10039-8{_}3196{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3197{_}But I have order, Sir--  _Fran_.
10039-8{_}3198{_}There's no such thing in this World.
10039-8{_}3199{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3200{_}I'm resolv'd to teaze him, if I can do nothing else, in revenge;--But, Sir, he most earnestly desires to entertain your fair Lady in his own house.
10039-8{_}3201{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3202{_}Yes, yes; I know he does; but I'll give him to the Devil first.--Troth, Sir, this _Cadiz_ Air does not agree with my fair Lady, she has ventured out but once, and has got an Ague already.
10039-8{_}3203{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3204{_}Agues, Sir, are kind Diseases, they allow of Truces and Cessations.
10039-8{_}3205{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3206{_}No, no; she has no Cessation, Friend, her Ague takes her night and day, it shakes her most unmercifully, and it shall shake her till the Wedding-day.
10039-8{_}3207{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3208{_}Were this Fellow to be tried by a Jury of Women, I would not be in his Coat to lie with his Lady.--What shall I do to deliver this Letter?--Well, Sir, since I see you are so averse to what the Governor desires, I'll return--but, Sir, I must tell you as a Friend, a Secret; that to a man of your temper may concern you;--Sir,--he's resolv'd when he comes next to visit his Mistress, to make another visit to your Apartment, to your Lady too.
10039-8{_}3209{_}[_Goes to whisper him, and gives Julia the Letter over his Shoulder_.
10039-8{_}3210{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3211{_}Is he so, pray tell him he need not take that pains; there's no occasion for't; besides 'twill be but in vain; for the Doctors have prescribed her Silence and Loneliness, 'tis good against the Fit; how this damn'd Fellow of a Rival torments me!
10039-8{_}3212{_}honest Friend, adieu.
10039-8{_}3213{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3214{_}Now is this Fellow so afraid of being made a Cuckold that he fears his own Shadow, and dares not go into his Wife's Chamber if the Sun do but shine into the room--                            [_Ex_.

10039-8{_}3220{_}what matter?

10039-8{_}3224{_}alas, what pity 'twas I carried you not in my hand, presented you to him my self, and beg'd him to favour me so much to do my office a little for me, or the like; hah,--  _Jul_.

10039-8{_}3277{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3278{_}Merchant!
10039-8{_}3279{_}why, what Husband do you expect?
10039-8{_}3280{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3281{_}A Cavalier at least, if not a Nobleman.
10039-8{_}3282{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3283{_}A Nobleman, marry come up, your Father, Huswife, meaning my self, was a Leather-seller at first, till, growing rich, I set up for a Merchant, and left that mechanick Trade; and since turned Gentleman; and Heav'n blest my Endeavours so as I have an Estate for a _Spanish_ Grandee; and, are you so proud, forsooth, that a Merchant won't down with you, but you must be gaping after a Cap and Feather, a Silver Sword with a more dreadful Ribbon at the hilt?--Come, come, I fear me, Huswise, you are one that puff's her up with Pride thus;--but lay thy hand upon thy Conscience now.--    [_To Jacinta_.
10039-8{_}3284{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3285{_}Who, I, Sir?
10039-8{_}3286{_}No, no, I am for marrying her out of hand to any reasonable Husband, except a Merchant; for Maids will long, and that's _Probatum est_ against the prevailing distemper of Longing.
10039-8{_}3287{_}Hitherto I dare answer for her, but Batteries will be made, and I dare not be always responsible for frail Mortality.
10039-8{_}3288{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3289{_}Well, I have provided her one that I like, but if she be so squeamish, let her fast, with a Murrain to her.
10039-8{_}3290{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3291{_}Dear Father.
10039-8{_}3292{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3293{_}Dear me no Dears: wou'd your old Mother were alive, she wou'd have strapt your Just-au-corps, for puleing after Cavaliers and Nobleman, i'faith, that wou'd she; a Citizen's Daughter, and would be a _Madona_--in good time.
10039-8{_}3294{_}_Isa.
10039-8{_}3295{_}Why, Father, the Gentry and Nobility now-a-days frequently marry Citizens Daughters.
10039-8{_}3296{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3297{_}Come, come, Mistress, I got by the City, and I love and honour the City; I confess 'tis the Fashion now-a-days, if a Citizen get but a little Money, one goes to building Houses, and brick Walls; another must buy an Office for his Son, a third hoists up his Daughter's Topsail, and flaunts it away, much above her breeding; and these things make so many break, and cause the decay of Trading: but I am for the honest _Dutch_ way of breeding their Children, according to their Fathers Calling.
10039-8{_}3298{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3299{_}That's very hard, because you are a laborious, ill-bred Tradesman, I must be bound to be a mean Citizen's Wife.
10039-8{_}3300{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3301{_}Why, what are you better than I, forsooth, that you must be a Lady, and have your Petticoats lac'd four Stories high; wear your false Towers, and cool your self with your _Spanish_ Fan?
10039-8{_}3302{_}Come, come, Baggage, wear me your best Clothes a Sunday, and brush 'em up a Monday Mornings, and follow your Needle all the Week after; that was your good old Mother's way, and your Grandmother's before her; and as for the Husband, take no care about it, I have designed it _Antonio_, and _Antonio_ you are like to wed, or beat the hoof, Gentlewoman, or turn poor _Clare_, and die a begging Nun, and there's an end on't--see where he comes--I'll leave you to ponder upon the business.
10039-8{_}3303{_}[_Exit_.]
10039-8{_}3304{_}_Enter_ Antonio.

10039-8{_}3310{_}Do I?
10039-8{_}3311{_}pray, for what Sin of mine must your fair Eyes be punish'd?
10039-8{_}3312{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3313{_}For the Sin of your odious Addresses to me, I have told you my mind often enough, methinks your Equals should be fitter for you, and sute more with your Plebeian Humour.
10039-8{_}3314{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3315{_}My Equals!
10039-8{_}3316{_}'Tis true, you are fair; but if there be any Inequality in our births, the advantage is on my side.

10039-8{_}3319{_}you understand your Pen and Ink, how to count your dirty Money, trudge to and fro chaffering of base commodities, and cozening those you deal with, till you sweat and stink again like an o'er heated Cook, faugh, I smell him hither.
10039-8{_}3320{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3321{_}I must confess I am not perfum'd as you are, to stifle Stinks you commonly have by Nature; but I have wholesom, cleanly Linen on; and for my Habit wore I but a Sword, I see no difference between your Don and me, only, perhaps, he knows less how to use it.
10039-8{_}3322{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3323{_}Ah, name not a Don, the very sound from the Mouth of a little Cit is disagreeable--Bargain and Sale, Bills, Money, Traffick, Trade, are words become you better.

10039-8{_}3345{_}ACT II.
10039-8{_}3346{_}SCENE I.
10039-8{_}3347{_}_A Chamber_.
10039-8{_}3348{_}_Enter_ Jacinta _with a Light, and_ Julia.
10039-8{_}3349{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3350{_}Well, Madam, have you writ to Don _Carlos_?
10039-8{_}3351{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3352{_}No, nor is it possible I shou'd, this Devil haunts me so from room to room, like my evil Genius to prevent that Good; oh, for an opportunity of one kind Minute to return Acknowledgments for this kind Letter he has sent me.
10039-8{_}3353{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3354{_}I'm glad you find me a Sybil: Madam, I ever prophesy'd a happier end of that Amour than your ill Fortune has hitherto promised,--but what said the lovely Cavalier?
10039-8{_}3355{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3356{_}All that a Man inspir'd with Love cou'd say, all that was soft and charming.
10039-8{_}3357{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3358{_}Nay, I believe his Art.
10039-8{_}3359{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3360{_}Judge then what my Heart feels, which like a Fire but lightly cover'd o'er with the cold Ashes of Despair, with the least blast breaks out into a Flame; I burn, I burn, _Jacinta_, and only charming _Carlos_ can allay my Pain--but how?
10039-8{_}3361{_}Ay, there's the question.
10039-8{_}3362{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3363{_}Some way I will contrive to speak with him, for he has lost his old wont if he traverse not the Street where you live: but see Donna _Clara_.--      _Enter_ Clara.
10039-8{_}3364{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3365{_}Hah, my Sister, whom yet my jealous heart can scarce be reconciled to; so deeply was my fear of Rivalship fixt there, --so sad, my Sister, and so near the happy day with _Carlos_?
10039-8{_}3366{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3367{_}'Tis pity she that thinks it so shou'd want him; the Blessing's thrown away on me, but we are both unhappy to be match'd to those we cannot love.
10039-8{_}3368{_}_Carlos_, though young, gay, handsom, witty, rich, I hate as much as you the old _Francisco_; for since I cannot marry my _Antonio_, both Youth and Beauty are but lost on me, and Age decrepid would be equal torment.
10039-8{_}3369{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3370{_}Wou'd _Carlos_ knew your heart, sure he'd decline; for he has too much Honor to compel a Maid to yield that loves him not.
10039-8{_}3371{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3372{_}'Tis true, he is above me every way, and the Honor my Father thinks to do our Family by this Match, makes him resolve upon't; but I have given my Vows to young _Antonio_.
10039-8{_}3373{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3374{_}And young _Antonio_ you are like to have, for any thing that _Carlos_ cares; for know, to thy eternal joy, my _Clara_, he has but feigned to thee, as much as thy _Antonio_ to _Isabella_.
10039-8{_}3375{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3376{_}But are you sure of this?
10039-8{_}3377{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3378{_}Most certain; this Night if you can let _Antonio_ see you, he'll tell you all the Cheat, and beg your Pardon.
10039-8{_}3379{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3380{_}Which he will soon obtain, and in return, what Service I can render him in your behalf he shall not want.
10039-8{_}3381{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3382{_}_Antonio_ will engage you they are Friends.
10039-8{_}3383{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3384{_}You amaze me.
10039-8{_}3385{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3386{_}I have appointed him this night to wait, and, if possible, I would get him a Minute's time with you.
10039-8{_}3387{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3388{_}Dear _Jacinta_, thou art the kindest Maid.--  _Jac_.
10039-8{_}3389{_}Hang't, why should we young Women pine and languish for what our own natural Invention may procure us; let us three lay our Heads together, and if _Machiavel_ with all his Politicks can out-wit us, 'tis pity but we all lead Apes in Hell, and die without the _Jewish_ Blessing of Consolation.
10039-8{_}3390{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3391{_}No more, here comes the Dragon.
10039-8{_}3392{_}_Enter_ Francisco.

10039-8{_}3394{_}So, together consulting and contriving.
10039-8{_}3395{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3396{_}What, are you jealous of the Petticoat?
10039-8{_}3397{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3398{_}Petticoat!
10039-8{_}3399{_}Come, come, Mistress _Pert_, I have known as much danger hid under a Petticoat, as a pair of Breeches.
10039-8{_}3400{_}I have heard of two Women that married each other--oh abominable, as if there were so prodigious a scarcity of Christian Mans Flesh.
10039-8{_}3401{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3402{_}No, the Market's well enough stored, thanks be praised, might every Woman be afforded a reasonable Allowance.
10039-8{_}3403{_}_Fran_.
10039-8{_}3404{_}Peace, I say, thou Imp of Lucifer; wou'd thou hadst thy Bellyful, that I might be fairly rid of thee--go get you up to your Chamber, and, d'ye hear, stir not from thence, on pain of our severe displeasure, for I am sent for in all haste, to Signior Don _Sebastian's_, 'tis but hard by, I shall soon return;--what, are you here?
10039-8{_}3405{_}_Enter_ Isabella.
10039-8{_}3406{_}I have a high commendation of your fine Behaviour, Gentlewoman, to _Antonio_; his Father has sent for me, and I shall know all anon, this shall but hasten your Wedding, Huswise, I tell you that, and so farewel to you--             [_Ex_.

10039-8{_}3410{_}_Jul_.
10039-8{_}3411{_}But will you go out so late, Love?
10039-8{_}3412{_}indeed some hurt will come to thee.
10039-8{_}3413{_}_Fran_.

10039-8{_}3439{_}Which word Lady I no sooner named, but I thought he would have saluted me with a Cudgel,--in fine, observing her behind him, whom he shelter'd all he could with his Cloke, I taking an occasion to whisper him, gave it her over his shoulder, whilst she return'd some Smiles and Looks of Joy,--but for an answer, 'twas impossible to get the least sign of one.
10039-8{_}3440{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3441{_}No matter, that joy was evident she wisht me one, and by the first opportunity my diligent waiting will be recompensed; but where hast thou been all this while?

10039-8{_}3522{_}Oh, take not this dear Body from my Arms, For if you do, my Soul will follow it.
10039-8{_}3523{_}_Jul_.

10039-8{_}3529{_}what mean you?
10039-8{_}3530{_}I shall die with fear.

10039-8{_}3533{_}let coward Lovers fear, who love by halves, We that intirely love are bold in Passion, Like Soldiers fir'd with glory dread no Danger.

10039-8{_}3535{_}But should we be unthrifty in our Loves, And for one Moment's joy give all away, And be hereafter damn'd to pine at distance?
10039-8{_}3536{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3537{_}Mistaken Miser, Love like Money put Into good hands increases every day, Still as you trust me, still the Sum amounts: Put me not off with promise of to morrow, To morrow will take care for new delights, Why shou'd that rob us of a present one?

10039-8{_}3539{_}Ah, _Carlos_!
10039-8{_}3540{_}How fondly do I listen to thy words, And fain would chide, and fain wou'd boast my Virtue, But mightier Love laughs at those poor delays; And I should doubtless give you all your _Julia_, Did not my fear prevent my kinder business; --And should _Francisco_ come and find me absent, Or take thee with me, we were lost, my _Carlos_.

10039-8{_}3545{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3546{_}'Tis certain, _Julia_, that thou must be mine.

10039-8{_}3774{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3775{_}By Heaven, and so will _Carlos_ then; for I'm so resolutely bent to possess that dear Creature, That I will do't with hazard of my Life, Expence of Fortune, or what's dear to me.
10039-8{_}3776{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3777{_}And how wou'd you reward that politick head, that shou'd contrive the means to bring this handsomly about; not for an a hour, or a night, but even as long as you please, with freedom; without the danger of venturing your honourable neck, in showing Feats of Activity three stories high, with a Dagger in one hand, and a Pistol in t'other, like a Ropedancer?
10039-8{_}3778{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3779{_}But how?
10039-8{_}3780{_}Thou talkest of Impossibilities.
10039-8{_}3781{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3782{_}Dost think she'll e'er consent to quit her Husband?
10039-8{_}3783{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3784{_}No, Heaven forbid, I am too good a Christian to part Man and Wife; but being naturally inclined to works of Charity, I will with one project I have in this noddle of mine,--make old _Francisco_ a Cuckold, accommodate my Lord and _Julia_, serve you, Sir,--and give our selves a good Scene of Mirth.
10039-8{_}3785{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3786{_}Thou amazest me.
10039-8{_}3787{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3788{_}If I do't not, send me to the Galleys; nay, and so far cure the Jealousy of the old Fellow, that from a rigid suspicious troublesom Fool, he shall become so tame and gentle a Husband,--that he shall desire you to favour him so much as to lie with his dear Wife.
10039-8{_}3789{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3790{_}By what strange Witchcraft shall this be brought to pass?
10039-8{_}3791{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3792{_}E'en honest Invention, Sir, good Faith, listen and believe:--When he goes, he certainly goes by Sea, to save the charges of Mules.
10039-8{_}3793{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3794{_}Right, I heard him say so; in the Galley that lies in the Port.
10039-8{_}3795{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3796{_}Good, there is a Galley also, in the Harbour, you lately took from the _Turks_; Habits too were taken in her enough to furnish out some forty or fifty as convenient _Turks_ as a man wou'd wish at the Devil.
10039-8{_}3797{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3798{_}Ah, Rogue, I begin to apprehend already.
10039-8{_}3799{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3800{_}Our _Turkish_ Galley thus man'd, I'll put to Sea, and about a League from Land, with a sham-fight set on that of Old _Francisco_, take it, make 'em all Slaves, clap the Old Fellow under hatches, and then you may deal with the fair Slave his Wife, as _Adam_ did with _Eve_.
10039-8{_}3801{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3802{_}I'm ravish'd with the thought.
10039-8{_}3803{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3804{_}But what will be the event of this?
10039-8{_}3805{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3806{_}I will not look so far, but stop at the dear Joys, and fear no Fate beyond 'em.
10039-8{_}3807{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3808{_}Nay, with a little cudgelling this dull Brain of mine I shall advance it farther for the Jest-sake;--as I take it, Signior Don _Antonio_, you have a fine Villa, within a Bow-shot of this City belonging to your self.
10039-8{_}3809{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3810{_}I have with pleasant Gardens, Grotto's, Waterworks.--  _Car_.
10039-8{_}3811{_}A most admirable Scene for Love and our Designs.
10039-8{_}3812{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3813{_}'Tis yours, Sir.
10039-8{_}3814{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3815{_}Then, Sir, when we have taken this old Fool, on whom the grossest cheat wou'd pass, much more this, which shall carry so seeming a Truth in't, he being clapt under hatches in the Dark, we'll wind round a League or two at Sea, turn in, and land at this Garden, Sir, of yours, which we'll pretend to be a _Seraglio_, belonging to the _Grand Seignior_; whither, in this hot part o'th' year, he goes to regale himself with his She-Slaves.
10039-8{_}3816{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3817{_}But the distance of Place and Time allow not such a Fallacy.
10039-8{_}3818{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3819{_}Why he never read in's life; knows neither Longitude nor Latitude, and _Constantinople_ may be in the midst of _Spain_ for any thing he knows; besides, his Fear will give him little leisure for thinking.
10039-8{_}3820{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3821{_}But how shall we do with the Seamen of this other Gally?
10039-8{_}3822{_}_Guz_.
10039-8{_}3823{_}There's not above a Dozen, besides the Slaves that are chain'd to the Oar, and those Dozen, a Pistole apiece wou'd not only make 'em assist in the design, but betray it in earnest to the _Grand Seignior_; --for them I'll undertake, the Master of it being _Pier de Sala_, your Father's old Servant, Sir.
10039-8{_}3824{_}[_To_ Carlos.
10039-8{_}3825{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3826{_}But possibly his mind may alter upon the Arrival of this False Count of ours?
10039-8{_}3827{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3828{_}No matter, make sure of those Seamen however; that they may be ready upon occasion.
10039-8{_}3829{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3830{_}'Tis high time for me that your Count were arriv'd, for this morning is destin'd the last of my Liberty.

10039-8{_}3848{_}Your Lordship's early up.
10039-8{_}3849{_}_Guil_.
10039-8{_}3850{_}My Stomach was up before me, Friend; and I'm damnably hungry; 'tis strange how a man's Appetite increases with his Greatness; I'll swinge it away now I'm a Lord,--then I will wench without Mercy; I'm resolv'd to spare neither Man, Woman, nor Child, not I; hey, Rogues, Rascals, Boys, my Breakfast, quickly, Dogs--let me see, what shall I have now that's rare?

10039-8{_}3854{_}A small rasher of delicate Bacon, Sirrah--of about a Pound, or two, with a small Morsel of Bread--round the Loaf, d'ye hear, quickly, Slaves.
10039-8{_}3855{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3856{_}That's gross meat, Sir, a pair of Quails--or--  _Guil_.
10039-8{_}3857{_}I thank you for that, i'faith, take your Don again, an you please, I'll not be starv'd for ne'er a Don in Christendom.
10039-8{_}3858{_}_Ant_.
10039-8{_}3859{_}But you must study to refine your Manners a little.
10039-8{_}3860{_}_Guil_.
10039-8{_}3861{_}Manners!
10039-8{_}3862{_}you shall pardon me for that; as if a Lord had not more privilege to be more saucy, more rude, impertinent, slovenly and foolish than the rest of his Neighbours, or Mankind.
10039-8{_}3863{_}_Car_.
10039-8{_}3864{_}Ay, ay, 'tis great.
10039-8{_}3865{_}_Guil_.

10039-8{_}3868{_}Well, you have your full Instructions; your Baggage, Bills and Letters, from _Octavio_ the _Sevilian_ Merchant.

10039-8{_}3880{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3881{_}Nay, I knew he would be civil, Madam, or I would have borne you Company; but neither my Mistress nor I, cou'd sleep one wink all Night, for fear of a Discovery in the Morning; and to save the poor Gentleman a tumbling Cast from the Window, my Mistress, just at day-break, feigned her self wondrous sick,--I was called, desired to go to Signior _Spadilio's_ the Apothecary's, at the next Door, for a Cordial; and so he slipt out;--but the Story of this false Count pleases me extremely, and, if it should take, Lord, what mirth we shall have.
10039-8{_}3882{_}Ha, ha, ha, I can't forbear with the thoughts on't.
10039-8{_}3883{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3884{_}And to see the Governor his Man?
10039-8{_}3885{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3886{_}Ah, what a Jest that would be too--Ha, ha, ha!
10039-8{_}3887{_}but here comes _Isabella_; let's puff up her Pride with Flatteries on her Beauty.
10039-8{_}3888{_}_Enter_ Isabella _looking in a Glass, and seeing her Face_.
10039-8{_}3889{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3890{_}Ah, Heavens, those Eyes--that Look,--that pretty Leer,--that my Father shou'd be so doating an old Fool to think these Beauties fit for a little Merchandize; a Marchioness wou'd so much better become me.
10039-8{_}3891{_}[Looks again.
10039-8{_}3892{_}--Ah, what a Smile's there--and then that scornful Look--'tis great-- Heavens, who's here?

10039-8{_}3897{_}Look on that Face; are there not Lines that foretel a world of Greatness, and promise much Honour?
10039-8{_}3898{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3899{_}Her Face, her Shape, her Mein, her every part declares her Lady--or something more.
10039-8{_}3900{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3901{_}Why, so, and yet this little Creature of a Father, ridiculously and unambitious, would spoil this Lady, to make up a simple Citizen's Wife--in good time.
10039-8{_}3902{_}_Jac_.
10039-8{_}3903{_}That very look had some presaging Grandeur.
10039-8{_}3904{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3905{_}Do you think so, _Jacinta_?
10039-8{_}3906{_}Ha, ha, ha.

10039-8{_}3920{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3921{_}She's evidently design'd for a Person of Quality.
10039-8{_}3922{_}_Isa_.
10039-8{_}3923{_}Besides I have so natural an Inclination for a Don, that if my Father do force me to marry this small Creature of a Merchant, I shall make an Intrigue with some body of Quality.
10039-8{_}3924{_}_Cla_.
10039-8{_}3925{_}Cou'd you but manage it well, and keep it from _Antonio_.
10039-8{_}3926{_}_Isa_.

10039-8{_}5433{_}_I Come not a Petitioner to sue, This Play the Author has writ down to you; 'Tis a slight Farce, five Days brought forth with ease, So very foolish that it needs must please; For though each day good Judges take offence,      | And Satir arms in Comedy's defence,                | You are still true to your _Jack-Pudding_ Sense.

10039-8{_}5442{_}THE LUCKY CHANCE; OR, AN ALDERMAN'S BARGAIN.
10039-8{_}5443{_}ARGUMENT.
10039-8{_}5444{_}Harry Bellmour, having killed his man in a duel, flies to Brussels, perforce leaving behind him Leticia, to whom he is affianced.
10039-8{_}5445{_}During his absence Sir Feeble Fainwou'd, a doting old alderman and his rival, having procured his pardon from the King to prevent it being granted if applied for a second time, and keeping this stratagem secret, next forges a letter as if from the Hague which describes in detail Bellmour's execution for killing a toper during a tavern brawl.
10039-8{_}5446{_}He then plies his suit with such ardour that Leticia, induced by poverty and wretchedness, reluctantly consents to marry him.
10039-8{_}5447{_}On the wedding morning Bellmour returns in disguise and intercepts a letter that conveys news of the arrival of Sir Feeble's nephew, Frank, whom his uncle has never seen.
10039-8{_}5448{_}The lover straightway resolves to personate the expected newcomer, and he is assisted in his design by his friend Gayman, a town gallant, who having fallen into dire need is compelled to lodge, under the name of Wasteall, with a smith in Alsatia.
10039-8{_}5449{_}His estate has been mortgaged to an old banker, Sir Cautious Fulbank, whose wife Julia he loves, and to her he pretends to have gone to Northamptonshire to his uncle's death bed.
10039-8{_}5450{_}He is discovered, unknown to himself, in his slummy retreat by Bredwel, Sir Cautious' prentice, who has to convey him a message with reference to the expiration of the mortgage, and who reveals the secret to Lady Fulbank.
10039-8{_}5451{_}She promptly abstracts five hundred pounds from her husband's strong box and forwards it to her lover by Bredwel, disguised as a devil, with an amorous message purporting to be from some unknown bidding him attend at a certain trysting place that night without fail.
10039-8{_}5452{_}Gayman, now able to redeem his forfeited estates, dresses in his finest clothes and appears at Sir Feeble Fainwou'd's wedding.
10039-8{_}5453{_}Bellmour has meanwhile revealed himself to Leticia, who is plunged in despair at the nuptials.
10039-8{_}5454{_}Lady Fulbank, who is present, greets Gayman and asks him to give her an assignation in the garden, but he excuses himself in order to keep his prior appointment, and she leaves him in dissembled anger.
10039-8{_}5455{_}Bredwel then in his satanic masquerade meets Gayman, and bringing him a roundabout way, introduces him into Sir Cautious' house, where, after having been entertained with a masque of dances and songs as by spirits, he is conducted to Lady Fulbank's chamber by her maid disguised as an ancient crone, and admitted to his mistress' embraces.
10039-8{_}5456{_}Meanwhile Sir Feeble Fainwou'd, who just at the moment of entering the bridal chamber has been hurriedly fetched away by Bellmour under the pretext of an urgent message from Sir Cautious concerning some midnight plot and an outbreak in the city, arrives at the house in great terror, and Sir Cautious (not knowing the reason of so late a visit) and he sit opposite each other for a while, gaping and staring in amaze.
10039-8{_}5457{_}Bredwel, to pass Gayman out undetected, ushers him through the room white-sheeted like a ghost, and the two old fools are well frightened, but eventually they conclude there has been some mistake or trick.
10039-8{_}5458{_}Sir Feeble returns home to find Leticia with her jewels about to flee, but she succeeds in reassuring him.
10039-8{_}5459{_}Gayman now visits Lady Fulbank and gives her some account of his adventures with the she-devil, all of which he half jestingly ascribes to magic.
10039-8{_}5460{_}Sir Cautious and various guests enter, dice are produced and, luck favouring the gallant, Gayman wins one hundred pounds from the old Banker, and a like sum from several others of the company.
10039-8{_}5461{_}As the niggardly Sir Cautious bewails his losses the victor offers to stake three hundred pounds against a night with Julia, the bargain, of course, being kept from the lady.
10039-8{_}5462{_}After some rumination Sir Cautious accepts and Gayman wins the throw.
10039-8{_}5463{_}That night he causes himself to be conveyed to Sir Cautious' house in a chest and Sir Cautious leads him to Lady Fulbank in bed, she supposing him to be her husband.
10039-8{_}5464{_}Meanwhile Sir Feeble being with Leticia is about to enter her bed when from behind the curtains Bellmour appears unmasqued, dressed in a torn and blood-stained shirt and brandishing a dagger.
10039-8{_}5465{_}Sir Feeble flies in terror.
10039-8{_}5466{_}The next morning Lady Fulbank discovers the trick which has been played upon her and rates both her husband and lover soundly.
10039-8{_}5467{_}Bellmour and Leticia arriving throw themselves on her protection.
10039-8{_}5468{_}Sir Feeble and Sir Cautious are at length obliged to acquiesce in the existing state of things and to resign their ladies to their two gallants.
10039-8{_}5469{_}They are unable to protest even when Sir Feeble finds that his daughter Diana has married Bredwel instead of Sir Cautious' nephew Bearjest for whom she was designed, whilst the choused fop is wedded to Pert, Lady Fulbank's woman, to whom he had been previously contracted.
10039-8{_}5470{_}SOURCE.
10039-8{_}5471{_}The plot of _The Lucky Chance; or, An Alderman's Bargain_ is original save for the details of Lady Fulbank's design upon Gayman, when he is conveyed to her house by masqued devils and conducted to her chamber by Pert dressed as a withered beldame.
10039-8{_}5472{_}In this Mrs. Behn exactly copies Shirley's excellent comedy, _The Lady of Pleasure_, produced at the Private House in Drury Lane, October, 1635, (4to 1637).
10039-8{_}5473{_}In the course of Lady Bornwell's intrigue with Kickshaw he is taken blindfold to the house of the procuress, Decoy, who, in the guise of a doting crone, leads him to a chamber where he imagines he is to meet a succubus, whilst the Lady, unknown to him, entertains him herself.
10039-8{_}5474{_}THEATRICAL HISTORY.
10039-8{_}5475{_}_The Lucky Chance; or, An Alderman's Bargain_, produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1687, was, with the exception of the disapproval of a certain pudibond clique, received with great favour, and kept the stage for a decade or more.
10039-8{_}5476{_}During the summer season of 1718 there was, on 24 July, a revival, 'not acted twenty years,' of this witty comedy at Lincoln's Inn Fields.
10039-8{_}5477{_}Gayman was played by Frank Leigh, son of the famous low comedian; Sir Feeble Fainwou'd by Bullock.
10039-8{_}5478{_}On 25 November, 1786, there was produced at Drury Lane a comedy by Mrs. Hannah Cowley (1743-1809), a prolific but mediocre dramatist, entitled, _A School for Greybeards; or, The Mourning Bride_ (4to 1786 and 1787).
10039-8{_}5479{_}Genest writes: 'On the first night it struck me that I had seen something like the play before and when the 4th act came I was fully satisfied--that part of the plot which concerns Antonia, Henry, and Gasper [Donna Antonia (The Mourning Bride), Mrs. Crouch; Don Henry, Kemble; Don Gasper (a Greybeard), Parsons; Donna Seraphina, Miss Farren]; and even the outlines of Seraphina's character, are taken from _The Lucky Chance_--as Mrs. Behn's play, though a very good one is too indecent to be ever represented again.
10039-8{_}5480{_}Mrs. Cowley might without any disgrace to herself have borrowed whatever she pleased provided she had made a proper acknowledgement--instead of which she says in her preface "--The idea of the business which concerns Antonia, Henry and Gasper was presented to me in an obsolete Comedy; I say the _idea_, for when it is known that in the original the scene lay among traders in London--and those traders of the lowest and most detestable manners, it will be conceived at once, that in removing it to Portugal and fixing the characters among the nobility, it was hardly possible to carry with me _more_ than the idea"--the traders whom Mrs. Cowley mentions, are both Knights, the one an Alderman, the other a Banker.'
10039-8{_}5481{_}Genest then compares various scenes and expressions from _The Lucky Chance_ with Mrs. Cowley and concludes 'The other scenes though they may differ in the dialogue yet agree in essentials--the scene in the 5th act between Alexis and Gasper bears the strongest resemblance to that between Sir Feeble and Sir Cautious in The Lucky Chance.
10039-8{_}5482{_}Mrs. Cowley was ashamed to advance a direct lie, but she was not ashamed to insinuate a falsehood--_A Naeuio uel sumpsisti multa, si fateris; uel, si negas surripuisti_--Cicero.'
10039-8{_}5483{_}The strictures of our stage historian are entirely apposite and correct.
10039-8{_}5484{_}Henry, Don Gasper and Antonia of the Georgian comedy are none other but Bellmour, Sir Feeble, and Leticia.
10039-8{_}5485{_}With regard to the reception of _The School for Greybeards_ 'the audience took needless offence at a scene in the 4th act, and an unfortunate expression in Young Bannister's part [Don Sebastian.
10039-8{_}5486{_}Bannister, jun., also spoke the prologue], revived the opposition in the last scene--no more was heard till King [Don Alexis] advanced to speak the last speech--some alteration was made on the 2nd night, and the play was acted 9 times or more in the course of the season, but never afterwards [It was played at Bath 28 October, 1813.
10039-8{_}5487{_}Chatterley acted Don Gasper; Miss Greville (from the Pantheon theatre), Donna Seraphina.
10039-8{_}5488{_}It had little success]--it is a good Comedy and was very well acted.'
10039-8{_}5489{_}The audience must indeed have been qualmish prudes.
10039-8{_}5490{_}Of all plays it is the most harmless.
10039-8{_}5491{_}The scene in the fourth Act to which exception was taken seems to have been No.
10039-8{_}5492{_}II, after the marriage of Gasper and Antonia, a most trifling and inept business.
10039-8{_}5493{_}In Act V, IV, Alexis says to Viola: 'As for you Madam bread and water, and a dark chamber shall be your lot--' but Sebastian (Bannister, jun.
10039-8{_}5494{_}), who has married Viola, breaks in crying: 'No, Sir,--I am the arbiter of her lot;--however, I confirm half your punishment; and a dark chamber she shall certainly have.'
10039-8{_}5495{_}To this speech in the 4to Mrs. Cowley appends the following note: 'This is the expression, I am told, which had nearly prov'd fatal to the Comedy.
10039-8{_}5496{_}I should not have printed it, but from the resolution I have religiously kept, of restoring every thing that was objected to.'
10039-8{_}5497{_}Imagination and ingenuity fail to fathom the cryptic indecency.
10039-8{_}5498{_}_The School for Greybeards_ is, in fine, a modest and mediocre comedy of little value.
10039-8{_}5499{_}12 December, 1786, Walpole, writing from Berkeley Square to the Countess of Upper Ossary, says: 'To-night ...
10039-8{_}5500{_}I am going to Mrs. Cowley's new play, which I suppose is as _instructive_ as the _Marriage of Figaro_, for I am told it approaches to those of Mrs. Behn in spartan delicacy; but I shall see Miss Farren, who, in my poor opinion, is the first of all actresses.'
10039-8{_}5501{_}Writing three days later to the same lady he has: '_The Greybeards_ have certainly been chastised, for we did not find them at all gross.
10039-8{_}5502{_}The piece is farcical and improbable, but has some good things, and is admirably acted.'
10039-8{_}5503{_}Those 'good things' are entirely due to Mrs. Behn.
10039-8{_}5504{_}To the Right Honourable _Laurence_, Lord _Hyde_, Earl of _Rochester_, one of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, Lord High Treasurer of _England_, and Knight of the Noble Order of the Garter.
10039-8{_}5505{_}My Lord,  When I consider how Ancient and Honourable a Date Plays have born, how they have been the peculiar Care of the most Illustrious Persons of _Greece_ and _Rome_, who strove as much to outdoe each other in Magnificence, (when by Turns they manag'd the great Business of the Stage, as if they had contended for the Victory of the Universe;) I say, my Lord, when I consider this, I with the greater Assurance most humbly address this Comedy to your Lordship, since by right of Antient Custom, the Patronage of Plays belong'd only to the great Men, and chiefest Magistrates.
10039-8{_}5506{_}Cardinal _Richelieu_, that great and wise Statesman, said, That there was no surer Testimony to be given of the flourishing Greatness of a State, than publick Pleasures and Divertisements--for they are, says he--the Schools of Vertue, where Vice is always either punish't, or disdain'd.
10039-8{_}5507{_}They are secret Instructions to the People, in things that 'tis impossible to insinuate into them any other Way.
10039-8{_}5508{_}'Tis Example that prevails above Reason or DIVINE PRECEPTS.
10039-8{_}5509{_}(Philosophy not understood by the Multitude;) 'tis Example alone that inspires Morality, and best establishes Vertue, I have my self known a Man, whom neither Conscience nor Religion cou'd perswade to Loyalty, who with beholding in our Theatre a Modern Politician set forth in all his Colours, was converted, renounc'd his opinion, and quitted the Party.
10039-8{_}5510{_}The Abbot of _Aubignac_ to show that Plays have been ever held most important to the very Political Part of Government, says, The Phylosophy of _Greece_, and the Majesty and Wisdom of the Romans, did equally concern their Great Men in making them Venerable, Noble, and Magnificent: Venerable, by their Consecration to their Gods: Noble, by being govern'd by their chiefest Men; and their Magnificency was from the publick Treasury, and the liberal Contributions of their Noble Men.
10039-8{_}5511{_}It being undeniable then, that Plays and publick Diversions were thought by the Greatest and Wisest of States, one of the most essential Parts of good Government, and in which so many great Persons were interested; suffer me to beg your Lordships Patronage for this little Endeavour, and believe it not below the Grandure of your Birth and State, the Illustrious Places you so justly hold in the Kingdom, nor your Illustrious Relation to the greatest Monarch of the World, to afford it the Glory of your Protection; since it is the Product of a Heart and Pen, that always faithfully serv'd that Royal Cause, to which your Lordship is by many Tyes so firmly fixt: It approaches you with that absolute Veneration, that all the World is oblig'd to pay you; and has no other Design than to express my sense of those excellent Vertues, that make your Lordship so truly admir'd and lov'd.
10039-8{_}5512{_}Amongst which we find those two so rare in a Great Man and a Statesman, those of Gracious Speech and easie Access, and I believe none were ever sent from your Presence dissatisfied.
10039-8{_}5513{_}You have an Art to please even when you deny; and something in your Look and Voice has an Air so greatly good, it recompences even for Disappointment, and we never leave your Lordship but with Blessings.
10039-8{_}5514{_}It is no less our Admiration, to behold with what Serenity and perfect Conduct, that great Part of the Nations Business is carry'd on, by one single Person; who having to do with so vast Numbers of Men of all Qualitys, Interests, and Humours, nevertheless all are well satisfi'd, and none complain of Oppression, but all is done with Gentleness and Silence, as if (like the first Creator) you cou'd finish all by a Word.
10039-8{_}5515{_}You have, my Lord, a Judgment so piercing and solid, a Wisdom so quick and clear, and a Fortitude so truly Noble, that those Fatigues of State, that wou'd even sink a Spirit of less Magnitude, is by yours accomplish't without Toil, or any Appearance of that harsh and crabbed Austerity, that is usually put on by the buisy Great.
10039-8{_}5516{_}You, my Lord, support the Globe, as if you did not feel its Weight; nor so much as seem to bend beneath it: Your Zeal for the Glorious Monarch you love and serve, makes all things a Pleasure that advance his Interest, which is so absolutely your Care.
10039-8{_}5517{_}You are, my Lord, by your generous Candor, your unbyast Justice, your Sweetness, Affability, and Condescending Goodness (those never-failing Marks of Greatness) above that Envy which reigns in Courts, and is aim'd at the most elevated Fortunes and Noblest Favourites of Princes: And when they consider your Lordship, with all the Abilitys and Wisdom of a great Counsellor, your unblemisht Vertue, your unshaken Loyalty, your constant Industry for the Publick Good, how all things under your Part of Sway have been refin'd and purg'd from those Grossnesses, Frauds, Briberys, and Grievances, beneath which so many of his Majestys Subjects groan'd, when we see Merit establish't and prefer'd, and Vice discourag'd; it imposes Silence upon Malice it self, and compells 'em to bless his Majesty's Choice of such a Pillar of the State, such a Patron of Vertue.
10039-8{_}5518{_}Long may your Lordship live to remain in this most Honourable Station, that his Majesty may be serv'd with an entire Fidelity, and the Nation be render'd perfectly Happy.
10039-8{_}5519{_}Since from such Heads and Hearts, the Monarch reaps his Glory, and the Kingdom receives its Safety and Tranquility.
10039-8{_}5520{_}This is the unfeign'd Prayer of,                                           My Lord,                                     Your Lordships most Humble                                           And most Obedient Servant                                                      A. Behn    PREFACE.
10039-8{_}5521{_}The little Obligation I have to some of the witty Sparks and Poets of the Town, has put me on a Vindication of this Comedy from those Censures that Malice, and ill Nature have thrown upon it, tho in vain: The Poets I heartily excuse, since there is a sort of Self-Interest in their Malice, which I shou'd rather call a witty Way they have in this Age, of Railing at every thing they find with pain successful, and never to shew good Nature and speak well of any thing; but when they are sure 'tis damn'd, then they afford it that worse Scandal, their Pity.
10039-8{_}5522{_}And nothing makes them so thorough-stitcht an Enemy as a full Third Day, that's Crime enough to load it with all manner of Infamy; and when they can no other way prevail with the Town, they charge it with the old never failing Scandal--That 'tis not fit for the Ladys: As if (if it were as they falsly give it out) the Ladys were oblig'd to hear Indecencys only from their Pens and Plays and some of them have ventur'd to treat 'em as Coursely as 'twas possible, without the least Reproach from them; and in some of their most Celebrated Plays have entertained 'em with things, that if I should here strip from their Wit and Occasion that conducts 'em in and makes them proper, their fair Cheeks would perhaps wear a natural Colour at the reading them: yet are never taken Notice of, because a Man writ them, and they may hear that from them they blush at from a Woman--But I make a Challenge to any Person of common Sense and Reason--that is not wilfully bent on ill Nature, and will in spight of Sense wrest a double _Entendre_ from every thing, lying upon the Catch for a Jest or a Quibble, like a Rook for a Cully; but any unprejudic'd Person that knows not the Author, to read any of my Comedys and compare 'em with others of this Age, and if they find one Word that can offend the chastest Ear, I will submit to all their peevish Cavills; but Right or Wrong they must be Criminal because a Woman's; condemning them without having the Christian Charity, to examine whether it be guilty or not, with reading, comparing, or thinking; the Ladies taking up any Scandal on Trust from some conceited Sparks, who will in spight of Nature be Wits and _Beaus_; then scatter it for Authentick all over the Town and Court, poysoning of others Judgments with their false Notions, condemning it to worse than Death, Loss of Fame.
10039-8{_}5523{_}And to fortifie their Detraction, charge me with all the Plays that have ever been offensive; though I wish with all their Faults I had been the Author of some of those they have honour'd me with.
10039-8{_}5524{_}For the farther Justification of this Play; it being a Comedy of Intrigue Dr. _Davenant_ out of Respect to the Commands he had from Court, to take great Care that no Indecency should be in Plays, sent for it and nicely look't it over, putting out anything he but imagin'd the Criticks would play with.
10039-8{_}5525{_}After that, Sir Roger _L'Estrange_ read it and licens'd it, and found no such Faults as 'tis charg'd with: Then Mr. _Killigrew_, who more severe than any, from the strict Order he had, perus'd it with great Circumspection; and lastly the Master Players, who you will I hope in some Measure esteem Judges of Decency and their own Interest, having been so many Years Prentice to the Trade of Judging.
10039-8{_}5526{_}I say, after all these Supervisors the Ladys may be convinc'd, they left nothing that could offend, and the Men of their unjust Reflections on so many Judges of Wit and Decencys.
10039-8{_}5527{_}When it happens that I challenge any one, to point me out the least Expression of what some have made their Discourse, they cry, _That Mr_.
10039-8{_}5528{_}Leigh _opens his Night Gown, when he comes into the Bride-chamber_; if he do, which is a Jest of his own making, and which I never saw, I hope he has his Cloaths on underneath?
10039-8{_}5529{_}And if so, where is the Indecency?
10039-8{_}5530{_}I have seen in that admirable Play of _Oedipus_, the Gown open'd wide, and the Man shown, in his Drawers and Waist coat, and never thought it an Offence before.
10039-8{_}5531{_}Another crys, _Why we know not what they mean, when the Man takes a Woman off the Stage, and another is thereby cuckolded_; is that any more than you see in the most Celebrated of your Plays?
10039-8{_}5532{_}as the _City Politicks_, the _Lady Mayoress_, and the _Old Lawyers Wife_, who goes with a Man she never saw before, and comes out again the joyfull'st Woman alive, for having made her Husband a Cuckold with such Dexterity, and yet I see nothing unnatural nor obscene: 'tis proper for the Characters.
10039-8{_}5533{_}So in that lucky Play of the _London Cuckolds_, not to recite Particulars.
10039-8{_}5534{_}And in that good Comedy of _Sir Courtly Nice_, the _Taylor to the young Lady_--in the fam'd Sir _Fopling Dorimont and Bellinda_, see the very Words--in _Valentinian_, see the Scene between the _Court Bawds_.
10039-8{_}5535{_}And _Valentinian_ all loose and ruffld a Moment after the Rape, and all this you see without Scandal, and a thousand others The _Moor of Venice_ in many places.
10039-8{_}5536{_}The _Maids Tragedy_--see the Scene of undressing the Bride, and between the _King_ and _Amintor_, and after between the _King_ and _Evadne_--All these I Name as some of the best Plays I know; If I should repeat the Words exprest in these Scenes I mention, I might justly be charg'd with course ill Manners, and very little Modesty, and yet they so naturally fall into the places they are designed for, and so are proper for the Business, that there is not the least Fault to be found with them; though I say those things in any of mine wou'd damn the whole Peice, and alarm the Town.
10039-8{_}5537{_}Had I a Day or two's time, as I have scarce so many Hours to write this in (the Play, being all printed off and the Press waiting,) I would sum up all your Beloved Plays, and all the Things in them that are past with such Silence by; because written by Men: such Masculine Strokes in me, must not be allow'd.
10039-8{_}5538{_}I must conclude those Women (if there be any such) greater Critics in that sort of Conversation than my self, who find any of that sort in mine, or any thing that can justly be reproach't.
10039-8{_}5539{_}But 'tis in vain by dint of Reason or Comparison to convince the obstinate Criticks, whose Business is to find Fault, if not by a loose and gross Imagination to create them, for they must either find the Jest, or make it; and those of this sort fall to my share, they find Faults of another kind for the Men Writers.
10039-8{_}5540{_}And this one thing I will venture to say, though against my Nature, because it has a Vanity in it: That had the Plays I have writ come forth under any Mans Name, and never known to have been mine; I appeal to all unbyast Judges of Sense, if they had not said that Person had made as many good Comedies, as any one Man that has writ in our Age; but a Devil on't the Woman damns the Poet.
10039-8{_}5541{_}Ladies, for its further Justification to you, be pleas'd to know, that the first Copy of this Play was read by several Ladys of very great Quality, and unquestioned Fame, and received their most favourable Opinion, not one charging it with the Crime, that some have been pleas'd to find in the Acting.
10039-8{_}5542{_}Other Ladys who saw it more than once, whose Quality and Vertue can sufficiently justifie any thing they design to favour, were pleas'd to say, they found an Entertainment in it very far from scandalous; and for the Generality of the Town, I found by my Receipts it was not thought so Criminal.
10039-8{_}5543{_}However, that shall not be an Incouragement to me to trouble the Criticks with new Occasion of affronting me, for endeavouring at least to divert; and at this rate, both the few Poets that are left, and the Players who toil in vain will be weary of their Trade.
10039-8{_}5544{_}I cannot omit to tell you, that a Wit of the Town, a Friend of mine at Wills Coffee House, the first Night of the Play, cry'd it down as much as in him lay, who before had read it and assured me he never 'saw a prettier Comedy.
10039-8{_}5545{_}So complaisant one pestilent Wit will be to another, and in the full Cry make his Noise too; but since 'tis to the witty Few I speak, I hope the better Judges will take no Offence, to whom I am oblig'd for better Judgments; and those I hope will be so kind to me, knowing my Conversation not at all addicted to the Indecencys alledged, that I would much less practice it in a Play, that must stand the Test of the censoring World.
10039-8{_}5546{_}And I must want common Sense, and all the Degrees of good Manners, renouncing my Fame, all Modesty and Interest for a silly Sawcy fruitless Jest, to make Fools laugh, and Women blush, and wise Men asham'd; My self all the while, if I had been guilty of this Crime charg'd to me, remaining the only stupid, insensible.
10039-8{_}5547{_}Is this likely, is this reasonable to be believ'd by any body, but the wilfully blind?
10039-8{_}5548{_}All I ask, is the Priviledge for my Masculine Part the Poet in me, (if any such you will allow me) to tread in those successful Paths my Predecessors have so long thriv'd in, to take those Measures that both the Ancient and Modern Writers have set me, and by which they have pleas'd the World so well: If I must not, because of my Sex, have this Freedom, but that you will usurp all to your selves; I lay down my Quill, and you shall hear no more of me, no not so much as to make Comparisons, because I will be kinder to my Brothers of the Pen, than they have been to a defenceless Woman; for I am not content to write for a Third day only.
10039-8{_}5549{_}I value Fame as much as if I had been born a _Hero_; and if you rob me of that, I can retire from the ungrateful World, and scorn its fickle Favours.
10039-8{_}5550{_}THE LUCKY CHANCE;  or, An Alderman's Bargain.
10039-8{_}5551{_}PROLOGUE,  Spoken by Mr. _Jevon_.
10039-8{_}5552{_}_Since with old Plays you have so long been cloy'd, As with a Mistress many years enjoy'd, How briskly dear Variety you pursue; Nay, though for worse ye change, ye will have New.
10039-8{_}5553{_}Widows take heed some of you in fresh Youth Have been the unpitied Martyrs of this Youth.
10039-8{_}5554{_}When for a drunken Sot, that had kind hours, And taking their own freedoms, left you yours; 'Twas your delib'rate choice your days to pass With a damn'd, sober, self-admiring Ass, Who thinks good usage for the Sex unfit, And slights ye out of Sparkishness and Wit.
10039-8{_}5555{_}But you can fit him--Let a worse Fool come, If he neglect, to officiate in his room.
10039-8{_}5556{_}Vain amorous Coxcombs every where are found, Fops for all uses, but the Stage abound.
10039-8{_}5557{_}Though you shou'd change them oftener than your Fashions, There still wou'd be enough for your Occasions: But ours are not so easily supplied, All that cou'd e'er quit cost, we have already tried.
10039-8{_}5558{_}Nay, dear sometimes have bought the Frippery stuff.
10039-8{_}5559{_}| This, Widows, you--I mean the old and tough--        | Will never think, be they but Fool enough.
10039-8{_}5560{_}|  Such will with any kind of Puppies play;             | But we must better know for what we pay:             | We must not purchase such dull Fools as they.
10039-8{_}5561{_}| Shou'd we shew each her own partic'lar Dear, What they admire at home, they wou'd loath here.
10039-8{_}5562{_}Thus, though the Mall, the Ring, the Pit is full, And every Coffee-House still swarms with Fool; Though still by Fools all other Callings live, Nay our own Women by fresh Cullies thrive, Though your Intrigues which no Lampoon can cure, Promise a long Succession to ensure; And all your Matches plenty do presage: Dire is the Dearth and Famine on the Stage.
10039-8{_}5563{_}Our Store's quite wasted, and our Credit's small, Not a Fool left to bless our selves withal.
10039-8{_}5564{_}We re forc't at last to rob, (which is great pity, Though 'tis a never-failing Bank) the City.
10039-8{_}5565{_}We show you one to day intirely new, And of all Jests, none relish like the true.
10039-8{_}5566{_}Let that the value of our Play inhance, Then it may prove indeed the_ Lucky Chance.

10039-8{_}5598{_}_The Street, at break of Day_.
10039-8{_}5599{_}_Enter_ Bellmour _disguis'd in a travelling Habit_.
10039-8{_}5600{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5601{_}Sure 'tis the day that gleams in yonder East, The day that all but Lovers blest by Shade Pay chearful Homage to: Lovers!
10039-8{_}5602{_}and those pursu'd like guilty me By rigid Laws, which put no difference 'Twixt fairly killing in my own Defence, And Murders bred by drunken Arguments, Whores, or the mean Revenges of a Coward.
10039-8{_}5603{_}--This is _Leticia's_ Father's House--    [_Looking about_.
10039-8{_}5604{_}And that the dear Balcony That has so oft been conscious of our Loves; From whence she has sent me down a thousand Sighs, A thousand looks of Love, a thousand Vows.
10039-8{_}5605{_}O thou dear witness of those charming Hours, How do I bless thee, how am I pleas'd to view thee After a tedious Age of Six Months Banishment.
10039-8{_}5606{_}_Enter Mr_.
10039-8{_}5607{_}Gingle _and several with Musick_.
10039-8{_}5608{_}_Fid_.
10039-8{_}5609{_}But hark ye, Mr. _Gingle_, is it proper to play before the Wedding?
10039-8{_}5610{_}_Gin_.
10039-8{_}5611{_}Ever while you live, for many a time in playing after the first night, the Bride's sleepy, the Bridegroom tir'd, and both so out of humour, that perhaps they hate any thing that puts 'em in mind they are married.
10039-8{_}5612{_}[_They play and sing_.
10039-8{_}5613{_}_Enter_ Phillis _in the Balcony, throws 'em Money_.
10039-8{_}5614{_}_Rise_, Cloris, _charming Maid, arise!
10039-8{_}5615{_}And baffle breaking Day,   Shew the adoring World thy Eyes     Are more surprizing gay;    The Gods of Love are smiling round,     And lead the Bridegroom on,   And_ Hymen _has the Altar crown'd.
10039-8{_}5616{_}While all thy sighing Lovers are undone.
10039-8{_}5617{_}To see thee pass they throng the Plain;     The Groves with Flowers are strown,   And every young and envying Swain     Wishes the hour his own.
10039-8{_}5618{_}Rise then, and let the God of Day,     When thou dost to the Lover yield,   Behold more Treasure given away     Than he in his vast Circle e'er beheld_.
10039-8{_}5619{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5620{_}Hah, _Phillis, Leticia's_ Woman!
10039-8{_}5621{_}_Ging_.
10039-8{_}5622{_}Fie, Mrs. _Phillis_, do you take us for Fiddlers that play for Hire?
10039-8{_}5623{_}I came to compliment Mrs. _Leticia_ on her Wedding-Morning because she is my Scholar.

10039-8{_}5632{_}Sure, I shall turn to Marble at this News: I harden, and cold Damps pass through my senseless Pores.--Hah, who's here?

10039-8{_}5648{_}My dearest _Bellmour_!
10039-8{_}5649{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5650{_}Oh thou false Friend, thou treacherous base Deceiver!
10039-8{_}5651{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5652{_}Hah, this to me, dear _Harry_?
10039-8{_}5653{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5654{_}Whither is Honour, Truth and Friendship fled?
10039-8{_}5655{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5656{_}Why, there ne'er was such a Virtue, 'Tis all a Poet's Dream.
10039-8{_}5657{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5658{_}I thank you, Sir.
10039-8{_}5659{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5660{_}I'm sorry for't, or that ever I did any thing that could deserve it: put up your Sword--an honest man wou'd say how he's offended, before he rashly draws.
10039-8{_}5661{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5662{_}Are not you going to be married, Sir?
10039-8{_}5663{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5664{_}No, Sir, as long as any Man in _London_ is so, that has but a handsom Wife, Sir.
10039-8{_}5665{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5666{_}Are you not in love, Sir?
10039-8{_}5667{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5668{_}Most damnably,--and wou'd fain lie with the dear jilting Gipsy.
10039-8{_}5669{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5670{_}Hah, who would you lie with, Sir?
10039-8{_}5671{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5672{_}You catechise me roundly--'tis not fair to name, but I am no Starter, _Harry_; just as you left me, you find me.
10039-8{_}5673{_}I am for the faithless _Julia_ still, the old Alderman's Wife.--'Twas high time the City should lose their Charter, when their Wives turn honest: But pray, Sir, answer me a Question or two.
10039-8{_}5674{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5675{_}Answer me first, what makes you here this Morning?
10039-8{_}5676{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5677{_}Faith, to do you service.
10039-8{_}5678{_}Your damn'd little Jade of a Mistress has learned of her Neighbours the Art of Swearing and Lying in abundance, and is--  _Bel_.
10039-8{_}5679{_}To be married!

10039-8{_}5681{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5682{_}Even so, God save the Mark; and she'll be a fair one for many an Arrow besides her Husband's, though he an old _Finsbury_ Hero this threescore Years.

10039-8{_}5686{_}Why, thy Cuckold that shall be, if thou be'st wise.

10039-8{_}5688{_}Away; Who is this Man?
10039-8{_}5689{_}thou dalliest with me.
10039-8{_}5690{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5691{_}Why, an old Knight, and Alderman here o'th' City, Sir _Feeble Fainwou'd_, a jolly old Fellow, whose Activity is all got into his Tongue, a very excellent Teazer; but neither Youth nor Beauty can grind his Dudgeon to an Edge.
10039-8{_}5692{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5693{_}Fie, what Stuff's here!
10039-8{_}5694{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5695{_}Very excellent Stuff, if you have but the Grace to improve it.
10039-8{_}5696{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5697{_}You banter me--but in plain _English_, tell me, What made you here thus early, Entring yon House with such Authority?
10039-8{_}5698{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5699{_}Why, your Mistress _Leticia_, your contracted Wife, is this Morning to be married to old Sir _Feeble Fainwou'd_, induc'd to't I suppose by the great Jointure he makes her, and the improbability of your ever gaining your Pardon for your high Duel--Do I speak _English_ now, Sir?
10039-8{_}5700{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5701{_}Too well, would I had never heard thee.
10039-8{_}5702{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5703{_}Now I being the Confident in your Amours, the Jack-go-between-- the civil Pimp or so--you left her in charge with me at your Departure.
10039-8{_}5704{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5705{_}I did so.
10039-8{_}5706{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5707{_}I saw her every day; and every day she paid the Tribute of a shower of Tears, to the dear Lord of all her Vows, young _Bellmour_: Till faith at last, for Reasons manifold, I slackt my daily Visits.
10039-8{_}5708{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5709{_}And left her to Temptation--was that well done?
10039-8{_}5710{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5711{_}Now must I afflict you and my self with a long tale of Causes why; Or be charg'd with want of Friendship.
10039-8{_}5712{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5713{_}You will do well to clear that Point to me.
10039-8{_}5714{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5715{_}I see you're peevish, and you shall be humour'd.--You know my _Julia_ play'd me e'en such another Prank as your false one is going to play you, and married old Sir _Cautious Fulbank_ here i'th' City; at which you know I storm'd, and rav'd, and swore, as thou wo't now, and to as little purpose.
10039-8{_}5716{_}There was but one way left, and that was cuckolding him.
10039-8{_}5717{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5718{_}Well, that Design I left thee hot upon.
10039-8{_}5719{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5720{_}And hotly have pursu'd it: Swore, wept, vow'd, wrote, upbraided, prayed and railed; then treated lavishly, and presented high--till, between you and I, _Harry_, I have presented the best part of Eight hundred a year into her Husband's hands, in Mortgage.
10039-8{_}5721{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5722{_}This is the Course you'd have me steer, I thank you.
10039-8{_}5723{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5724{_}No, no, Pox on't, all Women are not Jilts.
10039-8{_}5725{_}Some are honest, and will give as well as take; or else there would not be so many broke i'th' City.
10039-8{_}5726{_}In fine, Sir, I have been in Tribulation, that is to say, Moneyless, for six tedious Weeks, without either Clothes, or Equipage to appear withal; and so not only my own Love-affair lay neglected--but thine too--and I am forced to pretend to my Lady, that I am i'th' Country with a dying Uncle--from whom, if he were indeed dead, I expect two thousand a Year.
10039-8{_}5727{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5728{_}But what's all this to being here this Morning?
10039-8{_}5729{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5730{_}Thus have I lain conceal'd like a Winter-Fly, hoping for some blest Sunshine to warm me into life again, and make me hover my flagging Wings; till the News of this Marriage (which fills the Town) made me crawl out this silent Hour, to upbraid the fickle Maid.
10039-8{_}5731{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5732{_}Didst thou?--pursue thy kind Design.
10039-8{_}5733{_}Get me to see her; and sure no Woman, even possest with a new Passion, Grown confident even to Prostitution, But when she sees the Man to whom she's sworn so very--very much, will find Remorse and Shame.
10039-8{_}5734{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5735{_}For your sake, though the day be broke upon us, And I'm undone, if seen--I'll venture in--                                [_Throws his Cloke over_.
10039-8{_}5736{_}_Enter Sir_ Feeble Fainwou'd, _Sir_ Cautious Fulbank, Bearjest     _and_ Noisey.
10039-8{_}5737{_}[_Pass over the Stage, and go in_.
10039-8{_}5738{_}Hah--see the Bridegroom!
10039-8{_}5739{_}And with him my destin'd Cuckold, old Sir _Cautious Fulbank_.--Hah, what ail'st thou, Man?
10039-8{_}5740{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5741{_}The Bridegroom!
10039-8{_}5742{_}Like _Gorgon's_ Head he'as turned me into Stone.
10039-8{_}5743{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5744{_}_Gorgon's_ Head--a Cuckold's Head--'twas made to graft upon.
10039-8{_}5745{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5746{_}By Heaven, I'll seize her even at the Altar, And bear her thence in Triumph.
10039-8{_}5747{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5748{_}Ay, and be borne to _Newgate_ in Triumph, and be hanged in Triumph--'twill be cold Comfort, celebrating your Nuptials in the Press-Yard, and be wak'd next Morning, like Mr. _Barnardine_ in the Play--Will you please to rise and be hanged a little, Sir?
10039-8{_}5749{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5750{_}What wouldst thou have me do?
10039-8{_}5751{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5752{_}As many an honest Man has done before thee--Cuckold him-- cuckold him.
10039-8{_}5753{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5754{_}What--and let him marry her!
10039-8{_}5755{_}She that's mine by sacred Vows already!
10039-8{_}5756{_}By Heaven, it would be flat Adultery in her!
10039-8{_}5757{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5758{_}She'll learn the trick, and practise it the better with thee.
10039-8{_}5759{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5760{_}Oh Heavens!
10039-8{_}5761{_}_Leticia_ marry him!
10039-8{_}5762{_}and lie with him!-- Here will I stand and see this shameful Woman, See if she dares pass by me to this Wickedness.
10039-8{_}5763{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5764{_}Hark ye, _Harry_--in earnest have a care of betraying your self; and do not venture sweet Life for a fickle Woman, who perhaps hates you.
10039-8{_}5765{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5766{_}You counsel well--but yet to see her married!
10039-8{_}5767{_}How every thought of that shocks all my Resolution!-- But hang it, I'll be resolute and saucy, Despise a Woman who can use me ill, And think my self above her.
10039-8{_}5768{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5769{_}Why, now thou art thy self--a Man again.
10039-8{_}5770{_}But see, they're coming forth, now stand your ground.
10039-8{_}5771{_}_Enter Sir_ Feeble, _Sir_ Cautious, Bearjest, Noisey, Leticia     _sad_, Diana, Phillis.
10039-8{_}5772{_}[_Pass over the Stage_.
10039-8{_}5773{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5774{_}'Tis she; support me, _Charles_, or I shall sink to Earth, --Methought in passing by she cast a scornful glance at me; Such charming Pride I've seen upon her Eyes, When our Love-Quarrels arm'd 'em with Disdain-- I'll after 'em, if I live she shall not 'scape me.

10039-8{_}5778{_}Hold, remember you're proscribed, And die if you are taken.
10039-8{_}5779{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5780{_}I've done, and I will live, but he shall ne'er enjoy her.
10039-8{_}5781{_}--Who's yonder, _Ralph_, my trusty Confident?
10039-8{_}5782{_}_Enter_ Ralph.
10039-8{_}5783{_}Now though I perish I must speak to him.
10039-8{_}5784{_}--Friend, what Wedding's this?
10039-8{_}5785{_}_Ral_.
10039-8{_}5786{_}One that was never made in Heaven, Sir; 'Tis Alderman _Fainwou'd_, and Mrs. _Leticia Bredwel_.
10039-8{_}5787{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5788{_}Bredwel--I have heard of her,--she was Mistress--  _Ral_.
10039-8{_}5789{_}To fine Mr. _Bellmour_, Sir,--ay, there was a Gentleman --But rest his Soul--he's hang'd, Sir.
10039-8{_}5790{_}[_Weeps_.
10039-8{_}5791{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5792{_}How!
10039-8{_}5793{_}hang'd?
10039-8{_}5794{_}_Ral_.
10039-8{_}5795{_}Hang'd, Sir, hang'd--at the _Hague_ in _Holland_.
10039-8{_}5796{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5797{_}I heard some such News, but did not credit it.
10039-8{_}5798{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5799{_}For what, said they, was he hang'd?
10039-8{_}5800{_}_Ral_.
10039-8{_}5801{_}Why, e'en for High Treason, Sir, he killed one of their Kings.
10039-8{_}5802{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5803{_}Holland's a Commonwealth, and is not rul'd by Kings.
10039-8{_}5804{_}_Ral_.
10039-8{_}5805{_}Not by one, Sir, but by a great many; this was a Cheesemonger --they fell out over a Bottle of Brandy, went to Snicker Snee; Mr. _Bellmour_ cut his Throat, and was hang'd for't, that's all, Sir.
10039-8{_}5806{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5807{_}And did the young Lady believe this?
10039-8{_}5808{_}_Ral_.
10039-8{_}5809{_}Yes, and took on most heavily--the Doctors gave her over--and there was the Devil to do to get her to consent to this Marriage--but her Fortune was small, and the hope of a Ladyship, and a Gold Chain at the Spittal Sermon, did the Business--and so your Servant, Sir.
10039-8{_}5810{_}[_Ex_.
10039-8{_}5811{_}Ralph.
10039-8{_}5812{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5813{_}So, here's a hopeful Account of my sweet self now.
10039-8{_}5814{_}_Enter Post-man with Letters_.
10039-8{_}5815{_}_Post_.
10039-8{_}5816{_}Pray, Sir, which is Sir _Feeble Fainwou'd's_?

10039-8{_}5819{_}_Post_.
10039-8{_}5820{_}I have a Letter here from the _Hague_ for him.
10039-8{_}5821{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5822{_}From the _Hague_!
10039-8{_}5823{_}Now have I a curiosity to see it--I am his Servant--give it me--[_Gives it him, and Exit_.--Perhaps here may be the second part of my Tragedy, I'm full of Mischief, _Charles_--and have a mind to see this Fellow's Secrets.
10039-8{_}5824{_}For from this hour I'll be his evil Genius, haunt him at Bed and Board; he shall not sleep nor eat; disturb him at his Prayers, in his Embraces; and teaze him into Madness.

10039-8{_}5830{_}--Hum--hark ye, _Charles_, do you know who I am now?
10039-8{_}5831{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5832{_}Why, I hope a very honest Friend of mine, _Harry Bellmour_.
10039-8{_}5833{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5834{_}No, Sir, you are mistaken in your Man.
10039-8{_}5835{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5836{_}It may be so.
10039-8{_}5837{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5838{_}I am, d'ye see, _Charles_, this very individual, numerical young Mr.--_what ye call 'um Fainwou'd_, just come from _St.

10039-8{_}5842{_}I know you are, and will swear't upon occasion.
10039-8{_}5843{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5844{_}This lucky Thought has almost calm'd my mind.
10039-8{_}5845{_}And if I don't fit you, my dear Uncle, May I never lie with my Aunt.
10039-8{_}5846{_}_Gay_.
10039-8{_}5847{_}Ah, Rogue--but prithee what care have you taken about your Pardon?
10039-8{_}5848{_}'twere good you should secure that.
10039-8{_}5849{_}_Bel_.
10039-8{_}5850{_}There's the Devil, _Charles_,--had I but that--but I have had a very good Friend at work, a thousand Guyneys, that seldom fails; but yet in vain, I being the first Transgressor since the Act against Duelling.
10039-8{_}5851{_}But I impatient to see this dear delight of my Soul, and hearing from none of you this six weeks, came from _Brussels_ in this disguise--for the _Hague_ I have not seen, though hang'd there--but come--let's away, and compleat me a right _St.

10039-8{_}5857{_}Bredwel _gives her a Letter_.
10039-8{_}5858{_}_Lady_ Fulbank _reads_.
10039-8{_}5859{_}_Did my_ Julia _know how I languish in this cruel Separation,   she would afford me her pity, and write oftner.
10039-8{_}5860{_}If only the   Expectation of two thousand a year kept me from you, ah!_   Julia, _how easily would I abandon that Trifle for your more   valued sight; but that I know a fortune will render me   more agreeable to the charming_ Julia, _I should quit all my   Interest here, to throw my self at her Feet, to make her   sensible how I am intirely her Adorer_.
10039-8{_}5861{_}Charles Gayman.
10039-8{_}5862{_}--Faith, _Charles_, you lie--you are as welcome to me now, Now when I doubt thy Fortune is declining, As if the Universe were thine.
10039-8{_}5863{_}_Pert_.
10039-8{_}5864{_}That, Madam, is a noble Gratitude.
10039-8{_}5865{_}For if his Fortune be declining, 'tis sacrificed to his Passion for your Ladyship.
10039-8{_}5866{_}--'Tis all laid out on Love.
10039-8{_}5867{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5868{_}I prize my Honour more than Life, Yet I had rather have given him all he wish'd of me, Than be guilty of his Undoing.
10039-8{_}5869{_}_Pert_.
10039-8{_}5870{_}And I think the Sin were less.
10039-8{_}5871{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5872{_}I must confess, such Jewels, Rings and Presents as he made me, must needs decay his Fortune.
10039-8{_}5873{_}_Bred_.
10039-8{_}5874{_}Ay, Madam, his very Coach at last was turned into a Jewel for your Ladyship.
10039-8{_}5875{_}Then, Madam, what Expences his Despair have run him on --As Drinking and Gaming, to divert the Thought of your marrying my old Master.
10039-8{_}5876{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5877{_}And put in Wenching too.--  _Bred_.
10039-8{_}5878{_}No, assure your self, Madam--  L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5879{_}Of that I would be better satisfied--and you too must assist me, as e'er you hope I should be kind to you in gaining you _Diana_.

10039-8{_}5884{_}Nor will I be behind in my Duty.
10039-8{_}5885{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5886{_}Oh, how fatal are forc'd Marriages!
10039-8{_}5887{_}How many Ruins one such Match pulls on!
10039-8{_}5888{_}Had I but kept my Sacred Vows to _Gayman_, How happy had I been--how prosperous he!
10039-8{_}5889{_}Whilst now I languish in a loath'd embrace, Pine out my Life with Age--Consumptions, Coughs.
10039-8{_}5890{_}--But dost thou fear that Gayman is declining?
10039-8{_}5891{_}_Bred_.
10039-8{_}5892{_}You are my Lady, and the best of Mistresses-- Therefore I would not grieve you, for I know You love this best--but most unhappy Man.
10039-8{_}5893{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5894{_}You shall not grieve me--prithee on.
10039-8{_}5895{_}_Bred_.
10039-8{_}5896{_}My Master sent me yesterday to Mr. _Crap_, his Scrivener, to send to one Mr. _Wasteall_, to tell him his first Mortgage was out, which is two hundred pounds a Year--and who has since ingaged five or six hundred more to my Master; but if this first be not redeem'd, he'll take the Forfeit on't, as he says a wise Man ought.
10039-8{_}5897{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5898{_}That is to say, a Knave, according to his Notion of a wise Man.

10039-8{_}5919{_}Forgive me--you went to a Black-Smith's--  _Bred_.
10039-8{_}5920{_}Yes, Madam; and at the door encountred the beastly thing he calls a Landlady; who lookt as if she had been of her own Husband's making, compos'd of moulded Smith's Dust.
10039-8{_}5921{_}I ask'd for Mr. _Wasteall_, and she began to open--and did so rail at him, that what with her _Billinsgate_, and her Husband's hammers, I was both deaf and dumb--at last the hammers ceas'd, and she grew weary, and call'd down Mr. _Wasteall_; but he not answering--I was sent up a Ladder rather than a pair of Stairs; at last I scal'd the top, and enter'd the inchanted Castle; there did I find him, spite of the noise below, drowning his Cares in Sleep.
10039-8{_}5922{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5923{_}Whom foundst thou?
10039-8{_}5924{_}_Gayman_?

10039-8{_}5926{_}He, Madam, whom I waked--and seeing me, Heavens, what Confusion seiz'd him!
10039-8{_}5927{_}which nothing but my own Surprize could equal.
10039-8{_}5928{_}Asham'd--he wou'd have turn'd away; But when he saw, by my dejected Eyes, I knew him, He sigh'd, and blusht, and heard me tell my Business: Then beg'd I wou'd be secret; for he vow'd his whole Repose and Life depended on my silence.
10039-8{_}5929{_}Nor had I told it now, But that your Ladyship may find some speedy means to draw him from this desperate Condition.
10039-8{_}5930{_}L. _Ful_.

10039-8{_}5937{_}'Tis a pretty convenient Tub, Madam.
10039-8{_}5938{_}He may lie a long in't, there's just room for an old join'd Stool besides the Bed, which one cannot call a Cabin, about the largeness of a Pantry Bin, or a Usurer's Trunk; there had been Dornex Curtains to't in the days of Yore; but they were now annihilated, and nothing left to save his Eyes from the Light, but my Landlady's Blue Apron, ty'd by the strings before the Window, in which stood a broken six-penny Looking-Glass, that shew'd as many Faces as the Scene in _Henry_ the Eighth, which could but just stand upright, and then the Comb-Case fill'd it.
10039-8{_}5939{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5940{_}What a leud Description hast thou made of his Chamber?

10039-8{_}5942{_}Then for his Equipage, 'tis banisht to one small Monsieur, who (saucy with his Master's Poverty) is rather a Companion than a Footman.

10039-8{_}5947{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5948{_}How much redeems it?

10039-8{_}5950{_}Madam, five hundred Pounds.
10039-8{_}5951{_}L. _Ful_.
10039-8{_}5952{_}Enough--you shall in some disguise convey this Money to him, as from an unknown hand: I wou'd not have him think it comes from me, for all the World: That Nicety and Virtue I've profest, I am resolved to keep.

10039-8{_}7012{_}Why, know you then who did it?--Oh, how I'd be reveng'd upon the Rascal!

10039-8{_}7493{_}Faith, and that's pity; but how came he so fine o'th' sudden?
10039-8{_}7494{_}'Twas but last week he borrowed eighteen pence of me on his Waste-Belt to pay his Dinner in an Ordinary.

10039-8{_}7553{_}I'm sure as civil as he is, he helps him to steal my Gold, I doubt--and to be sure--Gentlemen, you say he's a Gamester--I desire when he comes anon, that you wou'd propose to sport a Dye, or so--and we'll fall to play for a Teaster, or the like--and if he sets any money, I shall go near to know my own Gold, by some remarkable Pieces amongst it; and if he have it, I'll hang him, and then all his six hundred a Year will be my own, which I have in Mortgage.

10039-8{_}8472{_}THE FORC'D MARRIAGE; OR, THE JEALOUS BRIDEGROOM.
10039-8{_}8473{_}ARGUMENT.
10039-8{_}8474{_}The King of France to reward his favourite Alcippus, at the motion of prince Philander, gladly assents to his being created general in place of old Orgulius, who seeks to resign his office, and further on his royal word pledges the new-made commander, Erminia, Orgulius' daughter, in marriage.
10039-8{_}8475{_}The lady, however, loves the dauphin, whilst the princess Galatea is enamoured of Alcippus.
10039-8{_}8476{_}All three are plunged into despair, and the brother and sister knowing each other's passion bemoan their hapless fate.
10039-8{_}8477{_}The prince, indeed, threatens to kill Alcippus, upon which Galatea declares she will poniard Erminia.
10039-8{_}8478{_}On the wedding night the bride confesses her love for Philander and refuses to admit Alcippus to her love.
10039-8{_}8479{_}The dauphin at the same time serenades Erminia at her chamber door, but Pisaro, a friend to Alcippus, meeting him, there is a scuffle during which Alcander, the prince's companion, wounds the intruder.
10039-8{_}8480{_}The noise rouses Erminia who issues from her room and encounters Philander.
10039-8{_}8481{_}Alcippus, seeing them together, mad with jealousy, attacks the prince.
10039-8{_}8482{_}He is, however, beaten back and even wounded, and later his fury is inflamed by Pisaro's tale, who also informs the favourite that Galatea, for whom the narrator cherishes a hopeless love, dotes fondly upon him.
10039-8{_}8483{_}Erminia, now that she has been joined in wedlock with Alcippus, guards herself carefully from the dauphin's passion, but when the general is obliged by his duties to leave for the camp Philander hopes to persuade her to yield to him.
10039-8{_}8484{_}Alcippus, however, whose departure is a feint, returns secretly, leaving Pisaro to continue the journey alone.
10039-8{_}8485{_}Isillia, Erminia's woman, has already admitted Philander to her mistress' chamber, when the lovers are surprised by the arrival of Alcippus on the scene.
10039-8{_}8486{_}The prince is concealed, although the meeting had been purely innocent, but he is betrayed owing to the fact of his inadvertently leaving his hat and sword upon a table.
10039-8{_}8487{_}He departs unmolested, but once he is gone Alcippus, beside himself with blind fury, strangles Erminia with an embroidered garter--Pisaro, coming in a few moments after, reproaches him with the murder but hurries him away to concealment.
10039-8{_}8488{_}The deed, however, is discovered and noised abroad by Falatius, a busy coxcomb courtier.
10039-8{_}8489{_}Orgulius demands Alcippus' life from the King, but Galatea, heart-broken, pleads for the man she loves.
10039-8{_}8490{_}Philander is distraught with grief, and the King decides that if he harms himself Alcippus shall straightway pay the forfeit.
10039-8{_}8491{_}The prince is about to wreak his vengeance on the cruel husband when he is met by Erminia herself, who, owing to her maid's attentions, has recovered from the swoon Alcippus took for death.
10039-8{_}8492{_}It is resolved that Alcippus, who is now torn with agony and remorse, must be fittingly punished, and accordingly as he lies sick at heart in his chamber Erminia enters as a spirit, and so looking over his shoulder into a mirror wherein he is gazing tells him plainly of Galatea's love.
10039-8{_}8493{_}The princess then passes by as it were a phantom, and after a masque, which he takes for a dream, he is conducted to a room draped in black wherein is placed a catafalque.
10039-8{_}8494{_}Here he encounters Philander and as they are at hot words the King, who has been privy to the whole design, enters and the two are reconciled.
10039-8{_}8495{_}Erminia next appears, and the happy accident explained, Erminia is bestowed upon the dauphin, whilst the princess is united to the favourite.
10039-8{_}8496{_}There is a slight underplot which deals with the amours of Aminta, sister to Pisaro, and Alcander.
10039-8{_}8497{_}She is also courted by the cowardly fop, Falatius.
10039-8{_}8498{_}SOURCE.
10039-8{_}8499{_}_The Forc'd Marriage; or, The Jealous Bridegroom_ is the earliest, and most certainly one of the weakest of Mrs. Behn's plays.
10039-8{_}8500{_}This is, however, far from saying that it is not a very good example of the Davenant, Howard, Porter, Stapylton school of romantic tragi-comedy.
10039-8{_}8501{_}But Aphara had not yet hit upon her brilliant vein of intrigue.
10039-8{_}8502{_}In _The Forced Marriage_ she seems to have remembered _The Maid's Tragedy_.
10039-8{_}8503{_}The situation between Alcippus and Erminia, Act ii, III, has some vague resemblance to that of Amintor and Evadne, Act ii, I. Aminta also faintly recalls Dula, whilst the song 'Hang love, for I will never pine' has a far-off echo of 'I could never have the power.'
10039-8{_}8504{_}But Mrs. Behn has not approached within measuring distance of that supreme masterpiece.
10039-8{_}8505{_}THEATRICAL HISTORY.
10039-8{_}8506{_}The stage history of _The Forc'd Marriage; or, The Jealous Bridegroom_ is best told in the quaint phrase of old Downes.
10039-8{_}8507{_}Produced in December, 1670 at the Duke's Theatre, Lincoln's Inn Fields, _The Jealous Bridegroom_, says the veteran prompter, 'wrote by Mrs. Behn, a good play and lasted six days'.
10039-8{_}8508{_}This, it must be remembered, was by no means a poor run at that time.
10039-8{_}8509{_}'Note,' continues the record, 'In this play, Mr. Otway the poet having an inclination to turn actor; Mrs. Behn gave him the King in this play for a probation part, but he being not us'd to the stage, the full house put him to such a sweat and tremendous agony, being dash'd, spoilt him for an actor.'
10039-8{_}8510{_}To quote Mr. Gosse's excellent and classic essay on Otway:--'The choice of the part showed the kindly tact of the shrewd Mrs. Behn.
10039-8{_}8511{_}The king had to speak the few first words, to which the audience never listens, to make some brief replies in the first scene, and then not to speak again until the end of the fourth act.
10039-8{_}8512{_}In the fifth act he had to make rather a long speech to Smith [Mr. Gosse by a slip writes 'Betterton'.
10039-8{_}8513{_}The King (v, III) is talking to Philander, acted by Smith.
10039-8{_}8514{_}Betterton played the favourite Alcippus.
10039-8{_}8515{_}], explaining that he was "old and feeble, and could not long survive," and this is nearly all he had to say till the very end, where he was in great force as the kind old man who unites the couples and speaks the last words.
10039-8{_}8516{_}It was quite a crucial test, and Otway proved his entire inability to face the public.
10039-8{_}8517{_}He trembled, was inaudible, melted in agony, and had to leave the stage.
10039-8{_}8518{_}The part was given to Westwood, a professional actor, and Otway never essayed to tread the boards again.'
10039-8{_}8519{_}_The Forced Marriage_ seems never to have been revived since its production.
10039-8{_}8520{_}On the title page of the second quarto (1690), _The Forc'd Marriage_ is said to have been played at the Queen's Theatre.
10039-8{_}8521{_}This is because the Duke's House temporarily changed its name thus.
10039-8{_}8522{_}It does not refer to a second run of the play.

10039-8{_}8526{_}PROLOGUE.
10039-8{_}8527{_}_Gallants, our Poets have of late so us'd ye, In Play and Prologue too so much abus'd ye, That should we beg your aids, I justly fear, Ye're so incens'd you'd hardly lend it here.
10039-8{_}8528{_}But when against a common Foe we arm, Each will assist to guard his own concern.
10039-8{_}8529{_}Women those charming Victors, in whose Eyes Lie all their Arts, and their Artilleries, Not being contented with the Wounds they made, Would by new Stratagems our Lives invade.
10039-8{_}8530{_}Beauty alone goes now at too cheap rates; And therefore they, like Wise and Politick States, Court a new Power that may the old supply, To keep as well as gain the Victory.
10039-8{_}8531{_}They'll join the force of Wit to Beauty now, And so maintain the Right they have in you.
10039-8{_}8532{_}If the vain Sex this privilege should boast, Past cure of a declining Face we're lost.
10039-8{_}8533{_}You'll never know the bliss of Change; this Art Retrieves (when Beauty fades) the wandring Heart; And though the Airy Spirits move no more, Wit still invites, as Beauty did before.
10039-8{_}8534{_}To day one of their Party ventures out, Not with design to conquer, but to scout.
10039-8{_}8535{_}Discourage but this first attempt, and then They'll hardly dare to sally out again.
10039-8{_}8536{_}The Poetess too, they say, has Spies abroad, Which have dispersed themselves in every road, I'th' Upper Box, Pit, Galleries; every Face You find disguis'd in a Black Velvet Case.
10039-8{_}8537{_}My life on't; is her Spy on purpose sent, To hold you in a wanton Compliment; That so you may not censure what she 'as writ, Which done, they face you down 'twas full of Wit.
10039-8{_}8538{_}Thus, while some common Prize you hope to win, You let the Tyrant Victor enter in.
10039-8{_}8539{_}I beg to day you'd lay that humour by, Till your Rencounter at the Nursery; Where they, like Centinels from duty free, May meet and wanton with the Enemy_.
10039-8{_}8540{_}Enter an Actress.
10039-8{_}8541{_}_How hast thou labour'd to subvert in vain, What one poor Smile of ours calls home again?
10039-8{_}8542{_}Can any see that glorious Sight and say_      [Woman pointing to the ladies.
10039-8{_}8543{_}_A Woman shall not Victor prove to day?
10039-8{_}8544{_}Who is't that to their Beauty would submit, And yet refuse the Fetters of their Wit?
10039-8{_}8545{_}He tells you tales of Stratagems and Spies; Can they need Art that have such powerful Eyes?
10039-8{_}8546{_}Believe me, Gallants, he'as abus'd you all; There's not a Vizard in our whole Cabal: Those are but Pickeroons that scour for prey And catch up all they meet with in their way; Who can no Captives take, for all they do Is pillage ye, then gladly let you go.
10039-8{_}8547{_}Ours scorns the petty Spoils, and do prefer The Glory not the Interest of the War: But yet our Forces shall obliging prove, Imposing nought but Constancy in Love: That's all our Aim, and when we have, it too, We'll sacrifice it all to pleasure you_.

10039-8{_}8572{_}_Enter_ King, Philander, Orgulius, Alcippus, Alcander,     Pisaro, Cleontius, Falatius; _and Officers_.
10039-8{_}8573{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8574{_}How shall I now divide my Gratitude, Between a Son, and one that has oblig'd me, Beyond the common duty of a Subject?
10039-8{_}8575{_}_Phil_.
10039-8{_}8576{_}Believe me, Sir, he merits all your Bounty, I only took example by his Actions; And all the part o'th' Victory which I gain'd, Was but deriv'd from him.
10039-8{_}8577{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8578{_}Brave Youth, whose Infant years did bring us Conquests; And as thou grew'st to Man, thou grew'st in Glory, And hast arriv'd to such a pitch of it, As all the slothful Youth that shall succeed thee, Shall meet reproaches of thy early Actions: When Men shall say, thus did the brave _Alcippus_; And that great Name shall every Soul inspire With Emulation to arrive at something, That's worthy of Example.
10039-8{_}8579{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}8580{_}I must confess I had the honour, Sir, To lead on twenty thousand fighting Men, Whom Fortune gave the Glory of the Day to.
10039-8{_}8581{_}I only bid them fight, and they obey'd me; But 'twas my Prince that taught them how to do so.
10039-8{_}8582{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8583{_}I do believe _Philander_ wants no courage; But what he did was to preserve his own.
10039-8{_}8584{_}But thine the pure effects of highest Valour; For which, if ought below my Crown can recompense, Name it, and take it, as the price of it.
10039-8{_}8585{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}8586{_}The Duty which we pay your Majesty, Ought to be such, as what we pay the Gods; Which always bears its Recompence about it.
10039-8{_}8587{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8588{_}Yet suffer me to make thee some return, Though not for thee, yet to incourage Bravery.
10039-8{_}8589{_}I know thy Soul is generous enough, To think a glorious Act rewards it self.
10039-8{_}8590{_}But those who understand not so much Virtue, Will call it my neglect, and want of Gratitude; In this thy Modesty will wrong thy King.
10039-8{_}8591{_}_Alcippus_, by this pause you seem to doubt My Power or Will; in both you are to blame.
10039-8{_}8592{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}8593{_}Your pardon, Sir; I never had a thought That could be guilty of so great a Sin.
10039-8{_}8594{_}That I was capable to do you service, Was the most grateful Bounty Heaven allow'd me, And I no juster way could own that Blessing, Than to imploy the Gift for your repose.
10039-8{_}8595{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8596{_}I shall grow angry, and believe your Pride Would put the guilt off on your Modesty, Which would refuse what that believes below it.
10039-8{_}8597{_}_Phil_.
10039-8{_}8598{_}Your Majesty thinks too severely of him; Permit me, Sir, to recompense his Valour, I saw the wonders on't, and thence may guess In some Degree, what may be worthy of it.
10039-8{_}8599{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8600{_}I like it well, and till thou hast perform'd it, I will divest my self of all my Power, And give it thee, till thou hast made him great.
10039-8{_}8601{_}_Phil_.
10039-8{_}8602{_}I humbly thank you, Sir--      [_Bows to the_ King, _takes the Staff from_ Orgulius,     _and gives it to_ Alcippus, _who looks amazedly_.
10039-8{_}8603{_}And here I do create him General.
10039-8{_}8604{_}You seem to wonder, as if I dispossess'd The brave _Orgulius_; but be pleas'd to know, Such Reverence and Respect I owe that Lord, As had himself not made it his Petition, I sooner should have parted with my Right, Than have discharg'd my debt by injuring him.
10039-8{_}8605{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8606{_}_Orgulius_, are you willing to resign it?
10039-8{_}8607{_}_Org_.
10039-8{_}8608{_}With your permission, Sir, most willingly; His vigorous Youth is fitter for't than Age, Which now has render'd me uncapable Of what that can with more success perform.
10039-8{_}8609{_}My Heart and Wishes are the same they were, But Time has quite depriv'd me of that power That should assist a happy Conqueror.
10039-8{_}8610{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8611{_}Yet Time has added little to your years, Since I restor'd you to this great Command, And then you thought it not unfit for you.
10039-8{_}8612{_}_Org_.
10039-8{_}8613{_}Sir, was it fit I should refuse your Grace?
10039-8{_}8614{_}That was your act of Mercy: and I took it To clear my Innocence, and reform the Errors Which those receiv'd who did believe me guilty, Or that my Crimes were greater than that Mercy.
10039-8{_}8615{_}I took it, Sir, in scorn of those that hated me, And now resign it to the Man you love.
10039-8{_}8616{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8617{_}We need not this proof to confirm thy Loyalty; Nor am I yet so barren of Rewards, But I can find a way, without depriving Thy noble Head of its victorious Wreaths, To crown another's Temples.
10039-8{_}8618{_}_Org_.
10039-8{_}8619{_}I humbly beg your Majesty's consent to't, If you believe _Alcippus_ worthy of it; The generous Youth I have bred up to Battles, Taught him to overcome, and use that Conquest As modestly as his submissive Captive, His Melancholy, (but his easy Fetters) To meet Death's Horrors with undaunted looks: How to despise the Hardships of a Siege; To suffer Cold and Hunger, want of Sleep.
10039-8{_}8620{_}Nor knew he other rest than on his Horse-back, Where he would sit and take a hearty Nap; And then too dreamt of fighting.
10039-8{_}8621{_}I could continue on a day in telling The Wonders of this Warrior.
10039-8{_}8622{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8623{_}I credit all, and do submit to you.
10039-8{_}8624{_}But yet _Alcippus_ seems displeas'd with it.
10039-8{_}8625{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}8626{_}Ah, Sir!
10039-8{_}8627{_}too late I find my Confidence Has overcome my unhappy Bashfulness; I had an humbler Suit to approach you with; But this unlook'd for Honour Has soon confounded all my lesser aims, As were they not essential to my Being, I durst not name them after what y'have done.
10039-8{_}8628{_}_King_.
10039-8{_}8629{_}It is not well to think my Kindness limited; This, from the Prince you hold, the next from me; Be what it will, I here declare it thine.
10039-8{_}8630{_}--Upon my life, designs upon a Lady; I guess it from thy blushing.
10039-8{_}8631{_}--Name her, and here thy King engages for her.

10039-8{_}8647{_}You need not urge that Duty to me, Sir.

10039-8{_}8663{_}Why the Devil should I rejoice?
10039-8{_}8664{_}Because I see another rais'd above me; Let him be great, and damn'd with all his Greatness.
10039-8{_}8665{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8666{_}Thou mean'st _Alcippus_, who I think merits it.
10039-8{_}8667{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8668{_}What is't that thou cal'st Merit?
10039-8{_}8669{_}He fought, it's true, so did you, and I, And gain'd as much as he o'th' Victory, But he in the Triumphal Chariot rode, Whilst we ador'd him like a Demi-God.
10039-8{_}8670{_}He with the Prince an equal welcome found, Was with like Garlands, though less Merit, crown'd.
10039-8{_}8671{_}_Fal_.
10039-8{_}8672{_}He's in the right for that, by _Jove_.
10039-8{_}8673{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8674{_}Nay, now you wrong him.
10039-8{_}8675{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8676{_}What's he I should not speak my sense of him?
10039-8{_}8677{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8678{_}He is our General.
10039-8{_}8679{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8680{_}What then?
10039-8{_}8681{_}What is't that he can do, which I'll decline?
10039-8{_}8682{_}Has he more Youth, more Strength, or Arms than I?
10039-8{_}8683{_}Can he preserve himself i'th' heat of the Battle?
10039-8{_}8684{_}Or can he singly fight a whole Brigade?
10039-8{_}8685{_}Can he receive a thousand Wounds, and live?
10039-8{_}8686{_}_Fal_.
10039-8{_}8687{_}Can you or he do so?
10039-8{_}8688{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8689{_}I do not say I can; but tell me then, Where be the Virtues of this mighty Man, That he should brave it over all the rest?
10039-8{_}8690{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8691{_}Faith, he has many Virtues, and much Courage; And merits it as well as you or I: _Orgulius_ was grown old.
10039-8{_}8692{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8693{_}What then?
10039-8{_}8694{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8695{_}Why then he was unfit for't, But that he had a Daughter that was young.
10039-8{_}8696{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8697{_}Yes, he might have lain by, Like rusty Armour, else, Had she not brought him into play again; The Devil take her for't.
10039-8{_}8698{_}_Fal_.
10039-8{_}8699{_}By _Jove_, he's dissatisfy'd with every thing.
10039-8{_}8700{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8701{_}She has undone my Prince, And he has most unluckily disarm'd himself, And put the Sword into his Rival's hand, Who will return it to his grateful Bosom.
10039-8{_}8702{_}_Phi_.
10039-8{_}8703{_}Why, you believe _Alcippus_ honest--  _Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8704{_}Yes, in your sense, _Pisaro_, But do not like the last demand he made; 'Twas but an ill return upon his Prince, To beg his Mistress, rather challeng'd her.
10039-8{_}8705{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8706{_}His ignorance that she was so, may excuse him.
10039-8{_}8707{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8708{_}The Devil 'twill, dost think he knew it not?
10039-8{_}8709{_}_Pis.
10039-8{_}8710{_}Orgulius_ still design'd him for _Erminia_; And if the Prince be disoblig'd from this, He only ought to take it ill from him.
10039-8{_}8711{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8712{_}Too much, _Pisaro_, you excuse his Pride, But 'tis the Office of a Friend to do so.
10039-8{_}8713{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8714{_}'Tis true, I am not ignorant of this, That he despises other Recompence For all his Services, but fair _Erminia_, I know 'tis long since he resign'd his Heart, Without so much as telling her she conquer'd; And yet she knew he lov'd; whilst she, ingrate, Repay'd his Passion only with her Scorn.
10039-8{_}8715{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8716{_}In loving him, she'd more ingrateful prove To her first Vows, to Reason, and to Love.
10039-8{_}8717{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8718{_}For that, _Alcander_, you know more than I.
10039-8{_}8719{_}_Fal_.
10039-8{_}8720{_}Why sure _Aminta_ will instruct her better, She's as inconstant as the Seas and Winds, Which ne'er are calm but to betray Adventurers.
10039-8{_}8721{_}_Alcan_.

10039-8{_}8728{_}Can you speak yet, or do you tell your tale With Eyes and Sighs, as you were wont to do?
10039-8{_}8729{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8730{_}Faith, much at that old rate, _Pisaro_, I yet have no incouragement from her To make my Court in any other language.
10039-8{_}8731{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}8732{_}You'll bring her to't, she must be overcome, And you're the fittest for her fickle Humour.
10039-8{_}8733{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}8734{_}Pox on't, this Change will spoil our making Love, We must be sad, and follow the Court-Mode: My life on't, you'll see desperate doings here; The Eagle will not part so with his Prey; _Erminia_ was not gain'd so easily, To be resign'd so tamely.--But come, my Lord, This will not satisfy our appetites, Let's in to Dinner, and when warm with Wine, We shall be fitter for a new Design.

10039-8{_}8739{_}Now am I in a very fine condition, A comfortable one, as I take it: I have ventur'd my Life to some purpose now; What confounded luck was this, that he of all men Living, should happen to be my Rival?

10039-8{_}8743{_}_Lab_.
10039-8{_}8744{_}I shall, Sir, 'tis truth.
10039-8{_}8745{_}_Fal_.

10039-8{_}8759{_}By no means, Sir, you had much better Have them in your Posteriors: for then the Ladies Can never disprove you; they'll not look there.

10039-8{_}8787{_}Why do you then keep such a stir, to gain The reputation of this thing you so despise?

10039-8{_}8812{_}_Oli_.
10039-8{_}8813{_}Madam, as those unreconciled to Heaven Would bear the pangs of death.
10039-8{_}8814{_}_Am_.
10039-8{_}8815{_}Time will convince her of that foolish error, Of thinking a brisk young Husband a torment.

10039-8{_}8848{_}You must my Wounds and my Misfortunes bear Before you can become my Counsellor.
10039-8{_}8849{_}You cannot guess the Torments I endure: Not knowing the Disease you'll miss the Cure.
10039-8{_}8850{_}_Am_.
10039-8{_}8851{_}Physicians, Madam, can the Patient heal Although the Malady they ne'er did feel; But your Disease is epidemical, Nor can I that evade that conquers all.
10039-8{_}8852{_}I lov'd, and never did like pleasure know, Which Passion did with time less vigorous grow.
10039-8{_}8853{_}_Gal_.

10039-8{_}8855{_}_Am_.

10039-8{_}8860{_}With more facility, than when the Dart Arm'd with resistless fire first seiz'd my Heart; 'Twas long then e'er the Boy could entrance get, And make his little Victory compleat; And now he'as got the knack on't, 'tis with ease He domineers, and enters when he please.

10039-8{_}8881{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}8882{_}I'll not reproach my Fortune, since in you Grief does the noblest of your Sex subdue; When your great Soul a sorrow can admit, I ought to suffer from the sense of it; Your cause of grief too much like mine appears, Not to oblige my Eyes to double tears; And had my heart no sentiments at home, My part in yours had doubtless fill'd the room.
10039-8{_}8883{_}But mine will no addition more receive, Fate has bestow'd the worst she had to give; Your mighty Soul can all its rage oppose, Whilst mine must perish by more feeble blows.
10039-8{_}8884{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}8885{_}Indeed I dare not say my cause of grief Does yours exceed, since both are past relief.

10039-8{_}8888{_}Madam, 'tis just I should to you resign, But here you challenge what is only mine: My Fate so cruel is, it will not give Leave to _Philander_ (if I die) to live: Might I but suffer all, 'twere some content, But who can live and see this languishment?
10039-8{_}8889{_}You, Madam, do alone your Sorrows bear, Which would be less, did but _Alcippus_ share; As Lovers we agree, I'll not deny, But thou art lov'd again, so am not I.
10039-8{_}8890{_}_Am_.
10039-8{_}8891{_}Madam, that grief the better is sustain'd, That's for a loss that never yet was gain'd; You only lose a man that does not know How great the honour is which you bestow; Who dares not hope you love, or if he did, Your Greatness would his just return forbid; His humble thoughts durst ne'er to you aspire, At most he would presume but to admire; Or if it chanc'd he durst more daring prove, You still must languish and conceal your Love.
10039-8{_}8892{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}8893{_}This which you argue lessens not my Pain, My Grief's the same were I belov'd again.
10039-8{_}8894{_}The King my Father would his promise keep, And thou must him enjoy for whom I weep.
10039-8{_}8895{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}8896{_}Ah, would I could that fatal gift deny; Without him you; and with him, I must die; My Soul your royal Brother does adore, And I, all Passion, but from him, abhor; But if I must th'unsuit _Alcippus_ wed, I vow he ne'er shall come into my Bed.
10039-8{_}8897{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}8898{_}That's bravely sworn, and now I love thee more Than e'er I was oblig'd to do before, --But yet, _Erminia_, guard thee from his Eyes, Where so much love, and so much Beauty lies; Those charms may conquer thee, which made me bow, And make thee love as well as break this Vow.
10039-8{_}8899{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}8900{_}Madam, it is unkind, though but to fear Ought but _Philander_ can inhabit here.

10039-8{_}8902{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}8903{_}Ah, that _Alcippus_ did not you approve, We then might hope these mischiefs to remove; The King my Father might be won by Prayer, And my too powerful Brother's sad despair, To break his word, which kept will us undo: And he will lose his dear _Philander_ too, Who dies and can no remedies receive: But vows that 'tis for you alone he'll live.
10039-8{_}8904{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}8905{_}Ah, Madam, do not tell me how he dies, I've seen too much already in his Eyes: They did the sorrows of his Soul betray, Which need not be confest another way: 'Twas there I found what my misfortune was, Too sadly written in his lovely face.

10039-8{_}8914{_}Away, away, you are a foolish Girl, And look with too much pride upon your Beauty; Which like a gaudy flower that springs too soon, Withers e'er fully blown.
10039-8{_}8915{_}Your very Tears already have betray'd Its weak inconstant nature; _Alcippus_, should he look upon thee now, would swear thou wert not that fine thing he lov'd.

10039-8{_}8921{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}8922{_}I humbly thank you, Sir, though't be too late, And wish you yet would try to change my Fate; What to _Alcippus_ you did Love believe, Was such a Friendship as might well deceive; 'Twas what kind Sisters do to Brothers pay; _Alcippus_ I can love no other way.
10039-8{_}8923{_}--Sir, lay the Interest of a Father by, And give me leave this Lover to deny.

10039-8{_}8952{_}I borrow'd Courage from my Innocence, And my own Virtue, Sir, was my defence.

10039-8{_}8955{_}Your Love from Folly, not from Virtue grew; You never could believe he'd marry you.

10039-8{_}8996{_}She lov'd me too, yes, and repaid my flame, As kindly as I sacrific'd to her: The first salute we gave were harmless Love, Our Souls then met, and so grew up together, Like sympathizing Twins.

10039-8{_}9017{_}If that could do't he nobly has endeavour'd it, But yet I think you need not yield her, Sir.

10039-8{_}9033{_}Shall I stand tamely by, and he receive That Heaven of bliss, defenceless she can give?
10039-8{_}9034{_}No, Sister, no, renounce that Brother's name, Suffers his Patience to surmount his Flame; I'll reach the Victor's heart, and make him see, That Prize he has obtain'd belongs to me.

10039-8{_}9036{_}Ah, dear _Philander_, do not threaten so, Whilst him you wound, you kill a Sister too.

10039-8{_}9038{_}Though all the Gods were rallied on his side, They should too feeble prove to guard his Pride.

10039-8{_}9041{_}Consider but the danger and the crime, And, Sir, remember that his life is mine.
10039-8{_}9042{_}_Phi_.
10039-8{_}9043{_}Peace, Sister, do not urge it as a sin, Of which the Gods themselves have guilty been: The Gods, my Sister, do approve Revenge By Thunder, which th'Almighty Ports unhinge, Such is their Lightning when poor Mortals fear, And Princes are the Gods inhabit here; Revenge has charms that do as powerful prove As those of Beauty, and as sweet as Love, The force of Vengeance will not be withstood, Till it has bath'd and cool'd it self in Blood.

10039-8{_}9046{_}Brother, that Captive you can ne'er retrieve More by the Victor's death, than if he live, For she in Honour cannot him prefer, Who shall become her Husband's Murderer; By safer ways you may that blessing gain, When venturing thus through Blood and Death prove vain.

10039-8{_}9048{_}With hopes already that are vain as Air, You've kept me from Revenge, but not Despair.
10039-8{_}9049{_}I had my self acquitted, as became _Erminia's_ wrong'd Adorer, and my Flame; My Rival I had kill'd, and set her free, Had not my Justice been disarm'd by thee.
10039-8{_}9050{_}--But for thy faithless Hope, I 'ad murder'd him, Even when the holy Priest was marrying them, And offer'd up the reeking Sacrifice To th'Gods he kneel'd to, when he took my price; By all their Purity I would have don't.
10039-8{_}9051{_}But now I think I merit the Affront: He that his Vengeance idly does defer, His Safety more than his Success must fear: I, like that Coward, did prolong my Fate, But brave Revenge can never come too late.

10039-8{_}9061{_}--But yet what thou hast said, I needs must blame, For if my resolutions prove the same, I now should kill thee, and my life renew; But were it brave or just to murder you?
10039-8{_}9062{_}At worst, I should an unkind Sister kill, Thou wouldst the sacred blood of Friendship spill.
10039-8{_}9063{_}I kill a Man that has undone my Fame, Ravish'd my Mistress, and contemn'd my Name, And, Sister, one who does not thee prefer: But thou no reason hast to injure her.
10039-8{_}9064{_}Such charms of Innocence her Eyes do dress, As would confound the cruel'st Murderess: And thou art soft, and canst no Horror see, Such Actions, Sister, you must leave to me.

10039-8{_}9071{_}Dear Brother, you out-run your Patience still, We'll neither die our selves, nor others kill; Something I'll do that shall thy joys restore, And bring thee back that health thou had'st before; --We're now expected at the Banquet, where I'd have thy Eyes more Love than Anger wear: This night be cheerful, and on me depend, On me, that am thy Sister, and thy Friend: A little raise _Alcippus'_ Jealousy And let the rest be carried on by me; Nor would it be amiss should you provide A Serenade to entertain the Bride: 'Twill give him Fears that may perhaps disprove The fond opinion of his happy Love.

10039-8{_}9146{_}In that of fighting, Madam; You would have call'd to mind that antient story Of the stout Giants that wag'd War with Heaven; Just so I fought, and for as glorious prize, Your excellent Ladiship.

10039-8{_}9196{_}But still methinks, _Erminia_, you are sad, A heaviness appears in those fair Eyes, As if your Soul were agitating something Contrary to the pleasure of this night.
10039-8{_}9197{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9198{_}You ought in Justice, Sir, t'excuse me here, Prisoners when first committed are less gay, Than when they're us'd to Fetters every day, But yet in time they will more easy grow.

10039-8{_}9200{_}You strangely bless me in but saying so.
10039-8{_}9201{_}_Er.
10039-8{_}9202{_}Alcippus_, I've an humble suit to you.
10039-8{_}9203{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9204{_}All that I have is so intirely thine, And such a Captive thou hast made my Will, Thou needst not be at the expence of wishing For what thou canst desire that I may grant; Why are thy Eyes declin'd?

10039-8{_}9206{_}To satisfy a little modest scruple; I beg you would permit me, Sir--  _Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9207{_}To lie alone to night, is it not so, _Erminia_?
10039-8{_}9208{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9209{_}It is--  _Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9210{_}That's too severe, yet I will grant it thee?
10039-8{_}9211{_}But why, _Erminia_, must I grant it thee?
10039-8{_}9212{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9213{_}The Princess, Sir, questions my Power, and says, I cannot gain so much upon your Goodness.
10039-8{_}9214{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9215{_}I could have wish'd some other had oblig'd thee to't.
10039-8{_}9216{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9217{_}You would not blame her if you knew her reason.
10039-8{_}9218{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9219{_}Indeed I do not much, for I can guess She takes the party of the Prince her Brother; And this is only to delay those Joys, Which she perhaps believes belong to him.
10039-8{_}9220{_}--But that, _Erminia_, you can best resolve; And 'tis not kindly done to hide a truth, The Prince so clearly own'd.
10039-8{_}9221{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9222{_}What did he own?
10039-8{_}9223{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9224{_}He said, _Erminia_, that you were his Wife; If so, no wonder you refuse my Bed:    [_She weeps_.
10039-8{_}9225{_}The Presence of the King hinder'd my knowledge, Of what I willingly would learn from you; --Come, ne'er deny a truth that plain appears; I see Hypocrisy through all your Tears.
10039-8{_}9226{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9227{_}You need not ask me to repeat again, A Knowledge which, you say, appears so plain: The Prince his word methinks should credit get, Which I'll confirm whene'er you call for it: My heart before you ask't it, was his prize, And cannot twice become a Sacrifice.
10039-8{_}9228{_}_Alcip.
10039-8{_}9229{_}Erminia_, is this brave or just in you, To pay his score of Love with what's my due?
10039-8{_}9230{_}What's your design to treat me in this sort?
10039-8{_}9231{_}Are sacred Vows of Marriage made your sport?
10039-8{_}9232{_}Regard me well, _Erminia_, what am I?
10039-8{_}9233{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9234{_}One, Sir, with whom, I'm bound to live and die, And one to whom, by rigorous command, I gave (without my Heart) my unwilling Hand.
10039-8{_}9235{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9236{_}But why, _Erminia_, did you give it so?
10039-8{_}9237{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9238{_}T'obey a King and cruel Father too.
10039-8{_}9239{_}A Friendship, Sir, I can on you bestow, But that will hardly into Passion grow; And 'twill an Act below your Virtue prove, To force a Heart you know can never love.
10039-8{_}9240{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9241{_}Am I the mask to hide your Blushes in, I the contented Fool to veil your Sin?
10039-8{_}9242{_}Have you already learnt that trick at Court, Both how to practise and secure your sport?
10039-8{_}9243{_}Brave Mistress of your Art, is this the way, My Service and my Passion to repay?
10039-8{_}9244{_}Will nothing but a Prince your pleasure fit, And could you think that I would wink at it?
10039-8{_}9245{_}Recal that Folly, or by all that's good, I'll free the Soul that wantons in thy Blood.

10039-8{_}9253{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9254{_}To some blest place, where Lovers do reside, Free from the noise of Jealousy and Pride; Where we shall know no other Power but Love, And where even thou wilt soft and gentle prove; So gentle, that if I should meet thee there, Thou would'st allow, what thou deny'st me here.
10039-8{_}9255{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9256{_}Thou hast disarm'd my Rage, and in its room A world of Shame and softer Passions come, Such as the first efforts of Love inspir'd, When by thy charming Eyes my Soul was fir'd.

10039-8{_}9258{_}I must confess your Fears are seeming just, But here to free you from the least mistrust, I swear, whilst I'm your Wife I'll not allow Birth to a Thought that tends to injuring you.

10039-8{_}9260{_}Not to believe thee, were a sin above The Injuries I have done thee by my Love.
10039-8{_}9261{_}--Ah, my _Erminia_, might I hope at last To share the pity of that lovely Breast, By slow degrees I might approach that Throne, Where now the blest _Philander_ reigns alone: Perhaps in time my Passion might redeem That now too faithful Heart y'ave given to him; Do but forbear to hear his amorous Tales, Nor from his moving Eyes learn what he ails: A Fire that's kindled cannot long survive, If one add nought to keep the flame alive.
10039-8{_}9262{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9263{_}I will not promise; what I mean to do My Virtue only shall oblige me to.

10039-8{_}9273{_}Madam, you strangely do improve my pain, To give me hopes you must recal again.
10039-8{_}9274{_}_Er.
10039-8{_}9275{_}Alcippus_, you this language will forbear, When you shall know how powerful you are; For whilst you here endeavour to subdue, The best of Women languishes for you.
10039-8{_}9276{_}_Alcip.
10039-8{_}9277{_}Erminia_, do not mock my misery, For though you cannot love, yet pity me; That you allow my Passion no return, Is weight enough, you need not add your Scorn, In this your Cruelty is too severe.
10039-8{_}9278{_}_Er.
10039-8{_}9279{_}Alcippus_, you mistake me every where.

10039-8{_}9365{_}_Erminia_ too you say has broke her Vows, She that will swear and lye, will do the rest.

10039-8{_}9370{_}I hope you'll find her, Sir, as willing to't As I am to suppose it; nay, believe't, She'll look upon't as want of Love and Courage Should you not now attempt it; You know, Sir, there's no other remedy, Take no denial, but the Game pursue, For what she will refuse, she wishes you.

10039-8{_}9659{_}Sir, I'm in earnest, you have gain'd that Heart, For which I have receiv'd so many wounds; Venturing for Trophies where none durst appear, To gain at my Return one single smile, Or that she would submit to hear my story: And when sh'has said, 'twas bravely done, _Pisaro_, I thought the Glory recompens'd the Toil; And sacrificed my Laurels at her feet, Like those who pay their first-fruits to the Gods, To beg a blessing on the following Crop: And never made her other signs of Love, Nor knew I that I had that easy flame, Till by her Eyes I found that she was mortal, And could love too, and that my Friend is you.
10039-8{_}9660{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9661{_}Thou hast amaz'd me, prithee speak more clearly.
10039-8{_}9662{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9663{_}My Lord, the Princess has a passion for you, Have I not reason now to be your Enemy?
10039-8{_}9664{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9665{_}Not till I make returns: But now I'm past redemption miserable.
10039-8{_}9666{_}'Twas she _Erminia_ told me dy'd for me; And I believ'd it but a slight of hers, To put me from my Courtship.
10039-8{_}9667{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9668{_}No, 'twas a fatal Truth: _Alcippus_, hadst thou seen her, whilst the Priest Was giving thee to fair _Erminia_, What languishment appear'd upon her Eyes, Which never were remov'd from thy lov'd Face, Through which her melting Soul in drops distill'd, As if she meant to wash away thy Sin, In giving up that Right belong'd to her, Thou hadst without my aid found out this truth: A sweet composure dwelt upon her looks, Like Infants who are smiling whilst they die; Nor knew she that she wept, so unconcern'd And freely did her Soul a passage find; Whilst I transported had almost forgot The Reverence due t'her sacred self and Place, And every moment ready was to kneel, And with my lips gather the precious drops, And rob the Holy Temple of a Relick, Fit only there t'inhabit.
10039-8{_}9669{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9670{_}I never thought thou'dst had this Softness in thee.
10039-8{_}9671{_}How cam'st thou, Friend, to hide all this from me?
10039-8{_}9672{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9673{_}My Lord, I knew not that I was a Lover; I felt no flame, but a religious Ardour, That did inspire my Soul with adoration; And so remote I was from ought but such, I knew not Hope, nor what it was to wish For other blessings than to gaze upon her: Like Heaven I thought she was to be possess'd, Where carnal Thoughts can no admittance find; And had I not perceiv'd her Love to you, I had not known the nature of my flame: But then I found it out by Jealousy, And what I took for a Seraphick motion, I now decline as criminal and earthly.
10039-8{_}9674{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9675{_}When she can love to a discovery, It shows her Passion eminent and high; --But I am married--to a Maid that hates me: What help for that, _Pisaro_?
10039-8{_}9676{_}And thou hast something too to say of her, What was't?
10039-8{_}9677{_}for now thou hast undone me quite.
10039-8{_}9678{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9679{_}I have nought to say to her dishonour, Sir, But something may be done may give you cause To stand upon your Guard; And if your Rage do not the mastery get, I cannot doubt but what you'll be happy yet.
10039-8{_}9680{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9681{_}Without _Erminia_ that can hardly be, And yet I find a certain shame within That will not suffer me to see the Princess; I have a kind of War within my Soul, My Love against my Glory and my Honour; And I could wish,--alas, I know not what: Prithee instruct me.
10039-8{_}9682{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9683{_}Sir, take a resolution to be calm, And not like Men in love abandon Reason.
10039-8{_}9684{_}--You may observe the actions of these Lovers, But be not passionate whate'er you find; That headstrong Devil will undo us all; If you'll be happy, quit its company.
10039-8{_}9685{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9686{_}I fain would take thy counsel--    [_Pauses_.
10039-8{_}9687{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}9688{_}Come, clear up, my Lord, and do not hang the head Like Flowers in storms; the Sun will shine again.
10039-8{_}9689{_}Set _Galatea's_ Charms before your Eyes, Think of the Glory to divide a Kingdom; And do not waste your noble Youth and Time Upon a peevish Heart you cannot gain.
10039-8{_}9690{_}This day you must to th'Camp, and in your absence I'll take upon me what I scorn'd last night, The Office of a Spy-- Believe me, Sir, for by the Gods I swear, I never wish'd the glory of a Conquest With half that zeal as to compose these differences.
10039-8{_}9691{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}9692{_}I do believe thee, and will tell thee something That past between the Prince and I last night; And then thou wilt conclude me truly miserable.

10039-8{_}9744{_}I understand that thou'rt an impudent fellow, Whom I must cudgel into better manners.

10039-8{_}9759{_}_Fal_.
10039-8{_}9760{_}Faith, very suddenly, for I think it will not be Hard to find men of your trade, Men that will fight as long as you can do, And Men that love it much better than I, Men that are poor and damn'd, fine desperate Rogues, Rascals that for a Pattacoon a Man Will fight their Fathers, And kiss their Mothers into peace again: Such, Sir, I think will fit you.

10039-8{_}9946{_}Thy Soul, I thought, was all so; but I see You have your weakness, can dissemble too; --I would have sworn that Sorrow in your face Had been a real one: Nay, you can die in jest, you can, false Woman: I hate thy Sex for this.

10039-8{_}9953{_}Come, now a tear or two to second that, And I am soft again, a very Ass.
10039-8{_}9954{_}--But yet that Look would call a Saint from th'Altar, And make him quite forget his Ceremony, Or take thee for his Deity: --But yet thou hast a very Hell within, Which those bewitching Eyes draw Souls into.

10039-8{_}9990{_}Galatea's _Apartments_.
10039-8{_}9991{_}_Enter_ Galatea _and_ Erminia.
10039-8{_}9992{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}9993{_}And 'tis an act below my Quality, Which, Madam, will not suffer me to fly.
10039-8{_}9994{_}_Gal.
10039-8{_}9995{_}Erminia_, e'er you boast of what you are, Since you're so high I'll tell you what you were: Your Father was our General 'tis true, That Title justly to his Sword was due; 'Twas nobly gain'd, and worth his Blood and Toils, Had he been satisfied with noble Spoils: But with that single honour not content, He needs must undermine the Government; And 'cause h'ad gain'd the Army to his side, Believ'd his Treason must be justify'd.
10039-8{_}9996{_}For this (and justly) he was banished; Where whilst a low and unknown life he led, Far from the hope and glory of a Throne, In a poor humble Cottage you were born; Your early Beauty did it self display, Nor could no more conceal it self than Day: Your Eyes did first _Philander's_ Soul inspire, And Fortune too conform'd her to his fire.
10039-8{_}9997{_}That made your Father greater than before, And what he justly lost that did restore.
10039-8{_}9998{_}'Twas that which first thy Beauty did disclose, Which else had wither'd like an unseen Rose; 'Twas that which brought thee to the Court, and there Dispos'd thee next my self, i'th' highest Sphere: Alas, obscurely else thou'dst liv'd and died, Not knowing thy own Charms, nor yet this Pride.
10039-8{_}9999{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10000{_}Madam, in this your Bounty is severe, Be pleas'd to spare that repetition here.
10039-8{_}10001{_}I hope no Action of my Life should be So rude to charge your Generosity: But, Madam, do you think it just to pay Your great Obligements by so false a way?
10039-8{_}10002{_}_Alcippus'_ Passion merits some return, And should that prove but an ingrateful scorn?
10039-8{_}10003{_}Alas, I am his Wife; to disobey, My Fame as well as Duty I betray.
10039-8{_}10004{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10005{_}Perfidious Maid, I might have thought thou'dst prove False to thy Prince, and Rival in my Love.
10039-8{_}10006{_}I thought too justly he that conquer'd me Had a sufficient power to captive thee; Thou'st now reveng'd thy Father's shame and thine, In taking thus _Philander's_ Life and mine.
10039-8{_}10007{_}[Er.
10039-8{_}10008{_}_weeps_.
10039-8{_}10009{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10010{_}Ah, Madam, that you would believe my tears, Or from my Vows but satisfy your Fears.
10039-8{_}10011{_}By all the Gods, _Alcippus_ I do hate, And would do any thing to change my fate; Ought that were just and noble I dare do.
10039-8{_}10012{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10013{_}Enough, _Erminia_, I must credit you, And will no other proof of it require, But that you'll now submit to my desire; Indeed, _Erminia_, you must grant my suit, Where Love and Honour calls, make no dispute.
10039-8{_}10014{_}Pity a Youth that never lov'd before, Remember 'tis a Prince that does adore; Who offers up a Heart that never found It could receive, till from your Eyes, a wound.
10039-8{_}10015{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10016{_}To your command should I submit to yield, Where could I from _Alcippus_ be conceal'd?
10039-8{_}10017{_}What could defend me from his jealous Rage?
10039-8{_}10018{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10019{_}Trust me, _Erminia_, I'll for that engage.
10039-8{_}10020{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10021{_}And then my Honour by that flight's o'erthrown.
10039-8{_}10022{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10023{_}That being _Philander's_, he'll preserve his own; And that, _Erminia_, sure you'll ne'er distrust.
10039-8{_}10024{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10025{_}Ah, Madam, give me leave to fear the worst.
10039-8{_}10026{_}_Enter_ Aminta.
10039-8{_}10027{_}_Am_.
10039-8{_}10028{_}Madam, _Alcippus_ waits for your Commands, He's going to the Camp.
10039-8{_}10029{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10030{_}Admit him.
10039-8{_}10031{_}_Enter_ Alcippus _and_ Pisaro.
10039-8{_}10032{_}_Gal.
10039-8{_}10033{_}Alcippus_, 'tis too soon to leave _Erminia_.
10039-8{_}10034{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10035{_}I wish she thought so, Madam, Or could believe with what regret I do so; She then would think the fault were much too small For such a Penance as my Soul must suffer.
10039-8{_}10036{_}_Am_.
10039-8{_}10037{_}No matter, Sir, you have the Year before you.
10039-8{_}10038{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10039{_}Yes, Madam, so has every Galley Slave, That knows his Toil, but not his Recompence: To morrow I expect no more content, Than this uneasy Day afforded me; And all before me is but one grand piece Of endless Grief and Madness: --You, Madam, taught _Erminia_ to be cruel, A Vice without your aid she could have learnt; And now to exercise that new taught Art, She tries the whole experience on my Heart.
10039-8{_}10040{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10041{_}If she do so, she learnt it not of me, I love, and therefore know no Cruelty: Such outrage cannot well with Love reside, Which only is the mean effect of Pride: --I merit better thoughts from you, _Alcippus_.
10039-8{_}10042{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10043{_}Pardon me, Madam, if my Passion stray Beyond the limits of my high respect;    [_He kneels_.
10039-8{_}10044{_}--'Tis a rude gust, and merits your reproaches: But yet the saucy Flame can ne'er controul That Adoration which I owe my Princess: That, with Religion, took possession here, And in my Prayers I mix with you the Deities.
10039-8{_}10045{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10046{_}I'ad rather you should treat me as a Mortal, Rise and begin to do so.
10039-8{_}10047{_}[_He rises and bows_.
10039-8{_}10048{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10049{_}Now, Madam, what must I expect from you?
10039-8{_}10050{_}_Er.
10039-8{_}10051{_}Alcippus_, all that's to your Virtue due.
10039-8{_}10052{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10053{_}In that but common Justice you allow.
10039-8{_}10054{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10055{_}That Justice, Sir, is all I can bestow.
10039-8{_}10056{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10057{_}In justice then you ought to me resign, That which the Holy Priest intitled mine; Yet that, without your Heart, I do despise, For uncompell'd I'd have that sacrifice: --Come ease me of that Pain that presses here, Give me but Hope that may secure my Fear, I'm not asham'd to own my Soul possest With Jealousy, that takes away my rest.
10039-8{_}10058{_}--Tell me you'll love, or that my Suit is vain, Do any thing to ease me of my pain.
10039-8{_}10059{_}Gods, Madam, why d'ye keep me in suspence?
10039-8{_}10060{_}This cannot be the effects of Innocence; By Heaven, I'll know the cause, where e'er it lies, Nor shall you fool me with your feign'd disguise.

10039-8{_}10074{_}--I hope, _Alcippus_, you'll revisit us With Lover's speed: And whatsoever treatment now you find, At your return you'll find us much more kind.

10039-8{_}10078{_}_Er_.
10039-8{_}10079{_}You are unkind to think I do not, Sir; --Yes, and am grown so softned by my pity, That I'm afraid I shall neglect my Vows, And to return your Passion, grow ingrate.

10039-8{_}10088{_}--Ah, should you still continue, as you are, Thus wondrous good, thus excellently fair, I should retain my growing name in War, And all the Glories I have ventur'd for, And fight for Crowns to recompense thy Bounty.
10039-8{_}10089{_}--This can your Smiles; but when those Beams are clouded, Alas, I freeze to very Cowardice, And have not Courage left to kill my self.

10039-8{_}10140{_}Such as I found you too, I fear, _Alcander_.

10039-8{_}10142{_}Ah, Madam, do not wrong me so; Till now I never knew the joys and sorrows That do attend a Soul in love like mine: My Passion only fits the Object now; I hate to tell you so, 'tis a poor low means To gain a Mistress by, of so much wit: _Aminta_, you're above that common rate Of being won.
10039-8{_}10143{_}Mean Beauties should be flatter'd into praise, Whilst you need only Sighs from every Lover, To tell you who you conquer, and not how, Nor to instruct you what attracts you have.

10039-8{_}10150{_}_Alcan_.
10039-8{_}10151{_}You think you're wondrous witty now, _Aminta_, But hang me if you be.

10039-8{_}10153{_}Indeed, _Alcander_, no, 'tis simple truth: Then for your bouncing Mistress, long _Brunetta_, O that majestick Garb, 'tis strangely taking, That scornful Look, and Eyes that strike all dead That stand beneath them.
10039-8{_}10154{_}_Alcander_, I have none of all these Charms: But well, you say you love me; could you be Content to dismiss these petty sharers in your Heart, And give it all to me; on these conditions I may do much.
10039-8{_}10155{_}_Alcan.
10039-8{_}10156{_}Aminta_, more perhaps than I may like.

10039-8{_}10158{_}Do not fear that, _Alcander_.
10039-8{_}10159{_}_Alcan_.

10039-8{_}10180{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10181{_}And then methought I was so, But yet even then I fear'd she did dissemble.
10039-8{_}10182{_}--Gods, what's a Man possest with Jealousy?
10039-8{_}10183{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}10184{_}A strange wild thing, a Lover without reason; I once have prov'd the torture on't, But as unlike to thine as good from evil; Like fire in Limbecks, mine was soft and gentle, Infusing kindly heat, till it distill'd The spirits of the Soul out at my Eyes, And so it ended.
10039-8{_}10185{_}But thine's a raging Fire, which never ceases Till it has quite destroy'd the goodly Edifice Where it first took beginning.
10039-8{_}10186{_}Faith, strive, Sir, to suppress it.

10039-8{_}10188{_}No, I'll let it run to its extent, And see what then 'twill do.
10039-8{_}10189{_}Perhaps 'twill make me mad, or end my life, Either of which will ease me.
10039-8{_}10190{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}10191{_}Neither of these, _Alcippus_; It will unman you, make you too despis'd; And those that now admire will pity you.
10039-8{_}10192{_}_Alcip_.
10039-8{_}10193{_}What wouldst thou have me do?
10039-8{_}10194{_}Am I not ty'd a Slave to follow Love, Whilst at my back Freedom and Honour waits, And I have lost the power to welcome them?
10039-8{_}10195{_}Like those who meet a Devil in the night, And all afrighted gaze upon the Fury, But dare not turn their backs to what they fear, Though safety lie behind them.
10039-8{_}10196{_}Alas!
10039-8{_}10197{_}I would as willingly as those Fly from this Devil, Love.

10039-8{_}10201{_}No, then like the damn'd Ghost it follows me.

10039-8{_}10776{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}10777{_}I have, and done as you commanded me.
10039-8{_}10778{_}I found him sitting by a Fountain side, Whose Tears had power to swell the little tide, Which from the Marble Statues breasts still flows: As silent and as numberless were those.
10039-8{_}10779{_}I laid me down behind a Thicket near, Where undiscover'd I could see and hear; The Moon the Day supply'd, and all below Instructed, even as much as Day could do.
10039-8{_}10780{_}I saw his postures, heard him rave and cry, _'Twas I that kill'd_ Erminia, _yes 'twas I_; Then from his almost frantick Head he'd tear Whole handfuls of his well-becoming Hair: Thus would he, till his Rage was almost spent, And then in softer terms he would lament: Then speak as if _Erminia_ still did live, And that Belief made him forget to grieve.
10039-8{_}10781{_}--The Marble Statue _Venus_ he mistook For fair _Erminia_, and such things he spoke, Such unheard passionate things, as e'en wou'd move The marble Statue's self to fall in love; He'd kiss its Breast, and say she kind was grown, And never mind, alas, 'twas senseless Stone; He took its Hand, and to his Mouth had laid it, But that it came not, and its stay betray'd it; Then would he blush, and all asham'd become, His Head declining, for awhile be dumb: His Arms upon his Breast across would lay, Then sensibly and calmly walk away; And in his walk a thousand things he said, Which I forgot, yet something with me staid; He did consult the nature of the Crime, And still concluded that 'twas just in him; He run o'er all his life, and found no act That was ungenerous in him, but this fact, From which the Justice took off the Disgrace, And might even for an act of Virtue pass; He did consult his Glory and his Pride; And whilst he did so, laid his grief aside; --Then was as calm as e'er he seem'd to be.
10039-8{_}10782{_}_Gal_.
10039-8{_}10783{_}And all this while did he ne'er mention me?
10039-8{_}10784{_}_Pis_.
10039-8{_}10785{_}Yes, Madam, and a thousand things he said, By which much Shame and Passion he betray'd: And then 'twas, Madam, I stept in and gave Counsels, I thought him fittest to receive; I sooth'd him up, and told him that the Crime I had committed, had the case been mine.
10039-8{_}10786{_}I all things said that might his Griefs beguile, And brought him to the sweetness of a Smile.
10039-8{_}10787{_}--To all I said he lent a willing ear, And my reproaches too at last did hear.
10039-8{_}10788{_}With this insensibly I drew him on, And with my flatteries so upon him won, Such Gentleness infus'd into his Breast, As has dispos'd his wearied Soul to rest: Sleeping upon a Couch I've left him now, And come to render this account to you.

10039-8{_}10801{_}But why, dear Picture, art thou still so gay, Since she is gone from whom those Charms were borrow'd?
10039-8{_}10802{_}Those Eyes that gave this speaking life to thine, Those lovely Eyes are clos'd in endless darkness; There's not a Star in all the face of Heaven, But now out-shines those Suns: Suns at Noon-day dispens'd not kindlier influence.

10039-8{_}10809{_}--'Twas I that murder'd her-- Thou lyest--thou durst as well be damn'd as touch her, She was all sacred; and that impious Hand That had profanely touch'd her, Had wither'd from the Body.
10039-8{_}10810{_}--I lov'd her--I ador'd her, and could I, Could I approach her with unhallowed thoughts?
10039-8{_}10811{_}--No, no, I durst not-- But as devoutest Pilgrims do the Shrine.
10039-8{_}10812{_}--If I had done't, The Gods who take the part of Innocence, Had been reveng'd-- Why did not Thunder strike me in the Action?
10039-8{_}10813{_}Why, if the Gods be just, and I had done't, Did they not suffer Earth to swallow me, Quick--quick into her bosom?
10039-8{_}10814{_}--But yet I say again, it was not I, --Let me behold this face, That durst appear in such a Villany.

10039-8{_}11184{_}THE EMPEROR OF THE MOON.
10039-8{_}11185{_}ARGUMENT.
10039-8{_}11186{_}Doctor Baliardo, a Neapolitan philosopher, has so applied himself to the study of the Moon, and is enraptured to such an extent with the mysteries of that orb, that he has come steadfastly to believe in a lunar world, peopled, ruled and regulated like the earth.
10039-8{_}11187{_}This wholly fills and absorbs his every waking thought, and, in consequence, he denies his daughter Elaria and his niece Bellemante to their respective lovers, the Viceroy's two nephews, Don Cinthio and Don Charmante, as being men of men of mere terrestial mould.
10039-8{_}11188{_}The girls are, however, secretly assisted in their amours by Scaramouch, the doctor's man, who is himself a rival of Harlequin, Cinthio's valet, for the hand of Mopsophil, duenna to the young ladies.
10039-8{_}11189{_}Harlequin, hoping to find his way to his mistress, gets to Bellemante's chamber but when she appears conceals himself.
10039-8{_}11190{_}The doctor, however, who has been hastily summoned to the bedside of his brother, reported dying, returns a moment after he has set out for a key which has been accidently dropped from his bunch and finds Cinthio and Elaria.
10039-8{_}11191{_}The gallant can only escape by pretending to be a lunatic brought to the house for medical treatment and cure.
10039-8{_}11192{_}But during the doctor's subsequent absence, whilst the two lovers are, as they suppose, securely entertaining their mistresses, the father is suddenly heard to return.
10039-8{_}11193{_}For the moment they evade him by feigning to be figures in a rich tapestry (their masquing habits aiding the trick), which Scaramouch declares he has just purchased.
10039-8{_}11194{_}But this sham being discovered, Scaramouch runs off with the candles and all slip away in the darkness and confusion, leaving him to return in his shirt as newly risen from bed.
10039-8{_}11195{_}The doctor is bawling for help when the wily servant totters out yawning and rubbing his eyes to explain the whole affair away as a delusion or a vision produced by lunar agency, declaring that there has been a visit from the Moon World of their King and the Prince of Thunderland, who have descended a-courting Elaria and Bellemante.
10039-8{_}11196{_}This is borne out by the girls themselves, who have previously been well primed by Mopsophil.
10039-8{_}11197{_}After some intriguing between Harlequin and Scaramouch for the duenna's hand, in the course of which the former disguises himself in female attire and again as a country lad, the latter as a learned apothecary, Charmante visits the doctor, and feigning to be a cabalist profound in occult lore, bids him prepare that night to receive Irednozor, monarch of the Moon, and the Prince of Thunderland who will appear to wed his daughter and his niece.
10039-8{_}11198{_}Harlequin shortly after makes his entry as an ambassador from the celestial spheres to confirm this news, and as Baliardo, overjoyed, is conversing with him strains of music are heard to herald the arrival of the lunar potentates.
10039-8{_}11199{_}All repair to an ancient gallery, long disused, whence the sound proceeds, and here, indeed, a pageant has been secretly arranged.
10039-8{_}11200{_}The room is discovered to be richly adorned with costly hangings and pictures, ablaze with lights, and presently, after various masqueraders have appeared dressed as the astronomers Keplair and Galileus, as the different signs of the zodiac, and in other fantastic garbs, Cinthio and Charmante are seen in a silver chariot like a half-moon, attended by a train of heroes and amorini.
10039-8{_}11201{_}There is no delay, the lovers are united in matrimony, Baliardo being overwhelmed at the honour done his house.
10039-8{_}11202{_}But when Scaramouch and Harlequin fight a ridiculous duel, in which the former wins, for the favour of Mopsophil, the doctor discovers the whole trick, to wit, that the lunar courtiers are in reality his own friends and neighbours.
10039-8{_}11203{_}He soon, however, yields to the persuasions of the lovers and the common-sense of his physician, who has taken part in the masque, and, realizing the folly of the fables he has so long implicitly believed, condemns his books to the fire and joins in the nuptial rejoicings with a merry heart.
10039-8{_}11204{_}SOURCE.
10039-8{_}11205{_}Mrs. Behn's farce is derived from _Arlequin Empereur dans la Lune_, which was played in Paris by Guiseppe-Domenico Biancolelli, a famous Harlequin and the leading member of the Italian theatre there from 1660 to 1688.
10039-8{_}11206{_}The original Italian scenes from which the French farce is taken belonged to that impromptu Comedy, 'Commedia dell' Arte all' Improviso,' which so far from being printed was but rarely even committed to writing.
10039-8{_}11207{_}'The development of the intrigue by dialogue and action was left to the native wit of the several players,' writes J.A.
10039-8{_}11208{_}Symonds in his excellent and most scholarly introduction prefacing Carlo Gozzi's _Memoirs_.
10039-8{_}11209{_}In the case of a new play, or rather a new theme, the choregus or manager would call the company together, read out the plot, sketch the scenario, explain all business, and leave the dialogue to the humour and smartness of the individual performer.
10039-8{_}11210{_}Their aptitude was amazing.
10039-8{_}11211{_}In Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_ we find Heironymo, who wishes to have a subject mounted in a hurry, saying:--      The Italian tragedians were so sharp of wit,     That in one hour's meditation     They would perform anything in action.
10039-8{_}11212{_}And Lorenzo rejoins:--      I have seen the like     In Paris, among the French tragedians.
10039-8{_}11213{_}Of course much was bound to become stereotyped and fixed, but much was ever fluctuating and new.
10039-8{_}11214{_}When Biancolelli died on 2 August, 1688, of pneumonia, contracted through neglecting to change damp clothes, the loss to the Italian theatre seemed irreparable, but in the following year an equally celebrated Harlequin, finer and wittier if not more popular than he, appeared in the person of Evariste Gherardi.
10039-8{_}11215{_}Gherardi was a man of culture, and he collected and edited a number of scenes, written in French, which were on the boards intermingled and played with the Italian farces in order to raise the tone of, and give something more solid and durable to, these entertainments.
10039-8{_}11216{_}In 1695 three volumes of these scenes were published at Amsterdam, 'chez Adrian Braakman,' under the title _Le Théâtre Italien, ou le Recueil de toutes les Comédies et Scènes Françoises qui ont été jouées sur le Théâtre Italien par la Troupe des Comediens du Roy de l'Hôtel de Bourgogne à Paris.
10039-8{_}11217{_}Arlequin Empereur dans la Lune_ had been published in its entirety eleven years previously (1684), but it was sufficiently popular for Gherardi to include various scenes therefrom in his collection.
10039-8{_}11218{_}Accordingly he commences his first volume by giving the 'Scène de la Fille de Chambre', where Harlequin, disguised as a woman, pretends to be seeking a place as waiting-maid to the Doctor--_Emperor of the Moon_, Act ii, v. In the French, Pierrot, dressed as the Doctor's wife, interviews the applicant.
10039-8{_}11219{_}Gherardi also gives a scene between Isabella (Elaria) and Colombine (Mopsophil); a scene where Harlequin arrives tricked out as an Apothecary to win Colombine (in Mrs. Behn it is Scaramouch who thus attempts to gain Mopsophil); and the final scene which differs considerably from the conclusion of the English farce.
10039-8{_}11220{_}In Vol.
10039-8{_}11221{_}II there are two further extracts 'obmises dans le premier Tome', a dialogue between the Doctor and Harlequin, 'recit que fait Arlequin au Docteur, du Voyage qu'il a fait dans le Monde de la Lune', and a short passage between Harlequin and Colombine, both of which can be closely paralleled in the English version.
10039-8{_}11222{_}Mrs. Behn of course used the edition of 1684.
10039-8{_}11223{_}Her statement that she only took 'a very barren and thin hint of the Plot' from the Italian, and again that 'all the Words are wholly new, without one from the Original' must not be pressed too strictly, although she has undeniably infused a new life, new wit and humour into the alien scenes.
10039-8{_}11224{_}In Maurice Sand's standard work on Italian comedy, _Masques et Bouffons_ (Paris, 1860) there will be found copious citations from this pantomime, the popularity of which he attributes wholly to Gherardi.
10039-8{_}11225{_}It was Biancolelli, however, who first brought it into favour and in whose lifetime it was actually printed, a rare honour, although doubtless it was owing to the great Gherardi that it retained and renewed its success.
10039-8{_}11226{_}Gherardi died 31 August, 1700.
10039-8{_}11227{_}As the author himself states in his preface, _Harlequin roi dans la Lune_, a three act comedy by Bodard de Tézay, produced at the Variétés Amusantes, 17 December, 1785, has nothing to do with the old Italian scenes.
10039-8{_}11228{_}An opera by Settle, entitled _The World in the Moon_, put on at Drury Lane in 1697, is quite different from Mrs. Behn's farce.
10039-8{_}11229{_}Settle has written a comedy which deals with the rehearsal of a new opera, _The New World in the Moon_.
10039-8{_}11230{_}Tom Dawkins, a country lout just arrived in London, is taken to the theatre to see the rehearsal, and ordinary comic scenes intermingled with provision for elaborate sets, as the opera proceeds, form the strangest jumble.
10039-8{_}11231{_}The piece takes its name from the first operatic scene, which represents a huge silver moon that gradually wanes, whilst a song, 'Within this happy world above', is performed.
10039-8{_}11232{_}THEATRICAL HISTORY.
10039-8{_}11233{_}_The Emperor of the Moon_, which is certainly as Lowe says 'one of the best pantomimic farces ever seen' on the English boards at any rate, was produced with great success at the Duke's Theatre, Dorset Garden, in 1687.
10039-8{_}11234{_}The character of Scaramouch was admirably suited to Tony Leigh, a low comedian 'of the mercurial kind', who 'in humour ... loved to take a full career', whilst Tom Jevon, young, slim and most graceful of dancers, proved the King of all Harlequins, past, present and to come.
10039-8{_}11235{_}Lee and Jevon also acted the parts of Scaramouch and Harlequin in Mountford's three act extravaganza, _Dr.
10039-8{_}11236{_}Faustus_ (4to 1697), but produced a decade earlier, probably November, 1685.
10039-8{_}11237{_}Scaramouch is the necromancer's man, and the comic scenes, although the stage tricks are old, prove very good pantomime.
10039-8{_}11238{_}It will be remembered that Harlequin and Scaramouch are to be found in _The Rover_, Part II.
10039-8{_}11239{_}Mrs. Behn's farce kept its place in the repertory and long remained a favourite.
10039-8{_}11240{_}On 18 September, 1702, at Drury Lane, Will Pinkethman, complying with the wish of several friends and critics, essayed Harlequin without the traditional black mask, 'but, alas!
10039-8{_}11241{_}in vain: Pinkethman could not take to himself the shame of the character without being concealed; he was no more _Harlequin_; his humour was quite disconcerted; his conscience could not, with the same effrontery, declare against nature, without the cover of that unchanging face, which he was sure would never blush for it; no, it was quite another case; without that armour his courage could not come up to the bold strokes that were necessary to get the better of common sense.'
10039-8{_}11242{_}Amongst the more notable performances of _The Emperor of the Moon_ were two at Dorset Garden on the 16 and 21 November, 1706, when Estcourt acted Scaramouch, and Pinkethman, Harlequin.
10039-8{_}11243{_}On 3 September, 1708, at Drury Lane, Bullock was Scaramouch; Bickerstaffe, Harlequin; Johnson, the old Doctor; Powell, Don Cinthio.
10039-8{_}11244{_}At Lincoln's Inn Fields, 28 June, 1717, Bullock again sustained Scaramouch and had Spiller as his Harlequin.
10039-8{_}11245{_}Four years later, 6 February, 1721, they were acting the same rôles at this theatre, with Mrs. Cross as Bellemante, and Quin, Ryan, in the cast.
10039-8{_}11246{_}The farce was repeated on 25 October of the same year.
10039-8{_}11247{_}Bullock and Spiller kept their favourite parts, Hall was Baliardo; Quin, Cinthio; Ryan, Charmante; Mrs. Egleton, Mopsophil; Mrs. Bullock, Bellemante.
10039-8{_}11248{_}Doggett's _The Country Wake_ was played the same night.
10039-8{_}11249{_}Ten years later, still at this theatre, on 20 October, 1731, Hall was again Baliardo and Mrs. Egleton, Mopsophil.
10039-8{_}11250{_}On this occasion Pinkethman played Harlequin; Hippisley, Scaramouch; Milward, Charmante; and Chapman, Cinthio.
10039-8{_}11251{_}The farce was put on as a first piece at Covent Garden, 14 February, 1739.
10039-8{_}11252{_}Pinkethman was Harlequin; Rosco, Scaramouch; Arthur, the Doctor; Hallam, Charmante; Hall, Cinthio; Mrs. James, Mopsophil; Mrs. Vincent, Elaria; and the fair Bellamy, Bellemante.
10039-8{_}11253{_}In 1748 there was a curious rivalry between the two theatres when both produced _The Emperor of the Moon_ on the same night, 26 December.
10039-8{_}11254{_}At Covent Garden, where it was billed 'not acted 10 years', and produced as a first piece at considerable expense with magnificent decorations, Cushing played Harlequin; Dunstall, Scaramouch; Sparks, Baliardo; Ryan, Charmante; Delane, Cinthio; Peg Woffington, Bellemante; and the Bellamy, Elaria.
10039-8{_}11255{_}It was, however, a dead failure and only acted twice.
10039-8{_}11256{_}Contrary to expectation Cushing was very bad as Harlequin, whilst at Drury Lane Woodward was excellent.
10039-8{_}11257{_}At the Lane, where it was played with Mrs. Centlivre's _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_ and billed 'not acted 20 years', Yates took Scaramouch; Palmer, Charmante; King, Cinthio; Winstone, Baliardo; Miss Murgatroyd, Bellemante; and the inimitable Mrs. Green, Mopsophil.
10039-8{_}11258{_}A great effect was produced when Harlequin is tossed in a blanket, Act iii.
10039-8{_}11259{_}Two long strips were sewn to the sides of the blanket by which he held.
10039-8{_}11260{_}From the front, however, they were invisible, and as it seemed that Woodward was being thrown to a dangerous height this spectacle immensely pleased the galleries.
10039-8{_}11261{_}In 1777 _The Emperor of the Moon_, very unnecessarily altered and by no means bettered 'with the addition of several airs, duets, and choruses selected from other compositions' (8vo, 1777), was produced at the Patagonian Theatre.
10039-8{_}11262{_}This theatre was situated in Exeter Change, Strand, on a portion of the site of Burleigh House, the town house of the great Lord Treasurer, which was afterwards known as Exeter House.
10039-8{_}11263{_}It is very doubtful if the theatre existed as such later than 1779.
10039-8{_}11264{_}There is an amusing reference to _The Emperor of the Moon_ in _The Spectator_, No.
10039-8{_}11265{_}22 (Steele), Monday, 26 March, 1711.
10039-8{_}11266{_}'_Your most humble servant_, William Serene' writes to Mr. Spectator bewailing the fact that nobody on the stage rises according to merit.
10039-8{_}11267{_}Although grown old in the playhouse service, and having often appeared on the boards, he has never had a line given him to speak.
10039-8{_}11268{_}None the less 'I have acted', he asserts, 'several Parts of Household-stuff with great Applause for many years: I am one of the Men in the Hangings in the _Emperour of the Moon_.'
10039-8{_}11269{_}[The allusion is of course to Act ii, III.]
10039-8{_}11270{_}Ralph Simple, Serene's friend, in a subsequent letter begs that upon the gentleman's promotion to speaking parts 'I may succeed him in the Hangings, with my Hand in the Orange-trees'.
10039-8{_}11271{_}These humorous allusions are ample evidence of the popularity of Mrs. Behn's pantomime and the frequency with which it was performed.
10039-8{_}11272{_}TO THE LORD MARQUESS OF WORCESTER, &.
10039-8{_}11273{_}My Lord  It is a common Notion, that gathers as it goes, and is almost become a vulgar Error, That Dedications in our Age, are only the effects of Flattery, a form of Complement, and no more; so that the Great, to whom they are only due, decline those Noble Patronages that were so generally allow'd the Ancient Poets; since the Awful Custom has been so scandaliz'd by mistaken Addresses, and many a worthy piece is lost for want of some Honourable Protection, and sometimes many indifferent ones traverse the World with that advantagious Pasport only.
10039-8{_}11274{_}This humble Offering, which I presume to lay at your Lordship's Feet, is of that Critical Nature, that it does not only require the Patronage of a great Title, but a great Man too, and there is often times a vast difference between these two great things; and amongst all the most Elevated, there are but very few in whom an illustrious Birth and equal Parts compleat the Hero; but among these, your Lordship bears the first Rank, from a just Claim, both of the glories of your Race and Vertues.
10039-8{_}11275{_}Nor need we look back into long past Ages, to bring down to ours the Magnanimous deeds of your Ancestors: We need no more than to behold (what we have so often done with wonder) those of the Great Duke of _Beauford_, your Illustrious Father, whose every single Action is a glorious and lasting President to all the future Great; whose unshaken Loyalty, and all other eminent Vertues, have rendred him to us, something more than Man, and which alone, deserving a whole Volume, wou'd be here but to lessen his Fame, to mix his Grandeurs with those of any other; and while I am addressing to the Son, who is only worthy of that Noble Blood he boasts, and who gives the World a Prospect of those coming Gallantries that will Equal those of his Glorious Father; already, My Lord, all you say and do is admir'd, and every touch of your Pen reverenc'd; the Excellency and Quickness of your Wit, is the Subject that fits the World most agreeably.
10039-8{_}11276{_}For my own part, I never presume to contemplate your Lordship, but my Soul bows with a perfect Veneration to your Mighty Mind; and while I have ador'd the delicate Effects of your uncommon Wit, I have wish'd for nothing more than an Opportunity of expressing my infinite Sense of it; and this Ambition, my Lord, was one Motive of my present Presumption in Dedicating this Farce to your Lordship.
10039-8{_}11277{_}I am sensible, my Lord, how far the Word Farce might have offended some, whose Titles of Honour, a Knack in dressing, or his Art in writing a Billet Doux, had been his chiefest Talent, and who, without considering the Intent, Character, or Nature of the thing, wou'd have cry'd out upon the Language, and have damn'd it (because the Persons in it did not all talk like Heros) as too debas'd and vulgar as to entertain a Man of Quality; but I am secure from this Censure, when your Lordship shall be its Judge, whose refin'd Sence, and Delicacy of Judgment, will, thro' all the humble Actions and trivialness of Business, find Nature there, and that Diversion which was not meant for the Numbers, who comprehend nothing beyond the Show and Buffoonry.
10039-8{_}11278{_}A very barren and thin hint of the Plot I had from the Italian, and which, even as it was, was acted in _France_ eighty odd times without intermission.
10039-8{_}11279{_}'Tis now much alter'd, and adapted to our English Theatre and Genius, who cannot find an Entertainment at so cheap a Rate as the French will, who are content with almost any Incoherences, howsoever shuffled together under the Name of a Farce; which I have endeavour'd as much as the thing wou'd bear, to bring within the compass of Possibility and Nature, that I might as little impose upon the Audience as I cou'd; all the Words are wholly new, without one from the Original.

10039-8{_}11281{_}and those things which ought to be the greatest Mysteries in Religion, and so rarely the Business of Discourse, are turn'd into Ridicule, and look but like so many fanatical Stratagems to ruine the Pulpit as well as the Stage.
10039-8{_}11282{_}The Defence of the first is left to the Reverend Gown, but the departing Stage can be no otherwise restor'd, but by some leading Spirits, so Generous, so Publick, and so Indefatigable as that of your Lordship, whose Patronages are sufficient to support it, whose Wit and Judgment to defend it, and whose Goodness and Quality to justifie it; such Encouragement wou'd inspire the Poets with new Arts to please, and the Actors with Industry.
10039-8{_}11283{_}'Twas this that occasion'd so many Admirable Plays heretofore, as Shakespear's, Fletcher's_, and _Johnson's_, and 'twas this alone that made the Town able to keep so many Play-houses alive, who now cannot supply one.

10039-8{_}11285{_}THE EMPEROR OF THE MOON.
10039-8{_}11286{_}PROLOGUE,  Spoken by Mr. _Jevern_.
10039-8{_}11287{_}_Long, and at vast Expence, th'industrious Stage Has strove to please a dull ungrateful Age: With Heroes and with Gods we first began, And thunder'd to you in heroick Strain: Some dying Love-sick Queen each Night you injoy'd, And with Magnificence at last were cloy'd: Our Drums and Trumpets frighted all the Women; Our Fighting scar'd the Beaux and Billet-Doux Men.
10039-8{_}11288{_}So Spark in an Intrigue of Quality, Grows weary of his splendid Drudgery; Hates the Fatigue, and cries a Pox upon her, What a damn'd Bustle's here with Love and Honour?
10039-8{_}11289{_}In humbler Comedy we next appear, No Fop or Cuckold, but slap-dash we had him here; We showed you all, but you malicious grown,       | Friends Vices to expose, and hide your own;       | Cry, damn it--This is such, or such a one.
10039-8{_}11290{_}| Yet nettled, Plague, what does the Scribler mean?
10039-8{_}11291{_}With his damn'd Characters, and Plot obscene.
10039-8{_}11292{_}No Woman without Vizard in the Nation Can see it twice, and keep her reputation-- That's certain, Forgetting-- That he himself, in every gross Lampoon, Her leuder Secrets spread about the Town; Whilst their feign'd Niceness is but cautious Fear, Their own Intrigues should be unravel'd here.
10039-8{_}11293{_}Our next Recourse was dwindling down to Farce, Then--Zounds, what Stuff's here?
10039-8{_}11294{_}'tis all o'er my-- Well, Gentlemen, since none of these has sped, Gad, we have bought a Share i'th' speaking Head.
10039-8{_}11295{_}So there you'll save a Sice,               | You love good Husbandry in all but Vice;   | Whoring and drinking only bears a Price.
10039-8{_}11296{_}|_      [The Head rises upon a twisted Post, on a Bench from     under the Stage.
10039-8{_}11297{_}After _Jevern_ speaks to its Mouth.
10039-8{_}11298{_}_Oh!--Oh!--Oh_!
10039-8{_}11299{_}Stentor.
10039-8{_}11300{_}_Oh!--Oh!--Oh_!
10039-8{_}11301{_}[After this it sings _Sawny_, laughs, crys God bless     the King in order.
10039-8{_}11302{_}Stentor answers.
10039-8{_}11303{_}_Speak louder_, Jevern, _if you'd have me repeat; Plague of this Rogue, he will betray the Cheat_.
10039-8{_}11304{_}[He speaks louder, it answers indirectly.
10039-8{_}11305{_}_--Hum--There 'tis again, Pox of your Eccho with a Northern Strain.
10039-8{_}11306{_}Well--This will be but a nine days Wonder too; There's nothing lasting but the Puppets Show.
10039-8{_}11307{_}What Ladies Heart's so hard, but it would move, To hear_ Philander _and_ Irene's _Love?
10039-8{_}11308{_}Those Sisters too the scandalous Wits do say, Two nameless keeping Beaux have made so gay; But those Amours are perfect Sympathy, Their Gallants being as mere Machines as they.
10039-8{_}11309{_}Oh!
10039-8{_}11310{_}how the City Wife, with her nown Ninny, Is charm'd with, Come into my Coach,--Miss_ Jenny, _Miss_ Jenny.
10039-8{_}11311{_}_But overturning_--Frible _crys--Adznigs, The jogling Rogue has murder'd all his Kids.
10039-8{_}11312{_}The Men of War cry, Pox on't, this is dull, We are for rough Sports,--Dog Hector, and the Bull.
10039-8{_}11313{_}Thus each in his degree, Diversion finds, Your Sports are suited to your mighty Minds; Whilst so much Judgment in your Choice you show, The Puppets have more Sense than some of you_.
10039-8{_}11314{_}DRAMATIS PERSONAE.
10039-8{_}11315{_}MEN.

10039-8{_}11321{_}Bellemante, Harlequin, Cinthio's _Man_,                          Mr. _Jevern_.
10039-8{_}11322{_}_Officer and Clerk_.
10039-8{_}11323{_}_Page_.
10039-8{_}11324{_}WOMEN.
10039-8{_}11325{_}Elaria, _Daughter to the Doctor_,                    Mrs. _Cooke_.
10039-8{_}11326{_}Bellemante, _Niece to the Doctor_,                   Mrs. _Mumford_.
10039-8{_}11327{_}Florinda, _Cousin to_ Elaria _and_ Bellemante.
10039-8{_}11328{_}Mopsophil, _Governante to the young Ladies_,         Mrs. _Cory_.
10039-8{_}11329{_}_The Persons in the Moon, are_ Don Cinthio, _Emperor_;    Don Charmante, _Prince of_ Thunderland.
10039-8{_}11330{_}_Their Attendants, Persons that represent the Court Cards_.
10039-8{_}11331{_}Keplair _and_ Galileus, _two Philosophers_.
10039-8{_}11332{_}_Twelve Persons, representing the Figures of the twelve Signs of the    Zodiack_.

10039-8{_}11336{_}ACT I.
10039-8{_}11337{_}SCENE I.
10039-8{_}11338{_}_A Chamber_.
10039-8{_}11339{_}_Enter_ Elaria _and_ Mopsophil.
10039-8{_}11340{_}I.
10039-8{_}11341{_}_A Curse upon that faithless Maid,   Who first her Sex's Liberty betray'd;   Born free as Man to Love and Range,   Till nobler Nature did to Custom change,   Custom, that dull excuse for Fools,   Who think all Virtue to consist in Rules_.
10039-8{_}11342{_}II.
10039-8{_}11343{_}_From Love our Fetters never sprung;   That smiling God, all wanton, gay and young,   Shows by his Wings he cannot be   Confined to a restless Slavery;   But here and there at random roves,   Not fix'd to glittering Courts, or shady Groves_.
10039-8{_}11344{_}III.
10039-8{_}11345{_}_Then she that Constancy profess'd   Was but a well Dissembler at the best;   And that imaginary Sway   She feign'd to give, in seeming to obey,   Was but the height of prudent Art,   To deal with greater liberty her Heart_.
10039-8{_}11346{_}[After the Song _Elaria_ gives her Lute to _Mopsophil_.
10039-8{_}11347{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11348{_}This does not divert me; Nor nothing will, till _Scaramouch_ return, And bring me News of _Cinthio_.
10039-8{_}11349{_}_Mop_.
10039-8{_}11350{_}Truly I was so sleepy last Night, I know nothing of the Adventure, for which you are kept so close a Prisoner to day, and more strictly guarded than usual.
10039-8{_}11351{_}_Ela.
10039-8{_}11352{_}Cinthio_ came with Musick last Night under my Window, which my Father hearing, sallied out with his _Mirmidons_ upon him; and clashing of Swords I heard, but what hurt was done, or whether _Cinthio_ were discovered to him, I know not; but the Billet I sent him now by _Scaramouch_ will occasion me soon Intelligence.
10039-8{_}11353{_}_Mop_.
10039-8{_}11354{_}And see, Madam, where your trusty _Roger_ comes.
10039-8{_}11355{_}_Enter_ Scaramouch, _peeping on all sides before he enters_.
10039-8{_}11356{_}You may advance, and fear none but your Friends.
10039-8{_}11357{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11358{_}Away, and keep the door.
10039-8{_}11359{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11360{_}Oh, dear _Scaramouch_!
10039-8{_}11361{_}hast thou been at the Vice-Roy's?
10039-8{_}11362{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11363{_}Yes, yes.
10039-8{_}11364{_}[_In heat_.
10039-8{_}11365{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11366{_}And hast thou delivered my Letter to his Nephew, Don _Cinthio_?
10039-8{_}11367{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11368{_}Yes, yes, what should I deliver else?
10039-8{_}11369{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11370{_}Well--and how does he?
10039-8{_}11371{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11372{_}Lord, how should he do?
10039-8{_}11373{_}Why, what a laborious thing it is to be a Pimp?
10039-8{_}11374{_}[_Fanning himself with his Cap_.
10039-8{_}11375{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11376{_}Why, well he shou'd do.
10039-8{_}11377{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11378{_}So he is, as well as a Night-adventuring Lover can be,--he has got but one Wound, Madam.
10039-8{_}11379{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11380{_}How!
10039-8{_}11381{_}wounded say you?
10039-8{_}11382{_}Oh Heavens!
10039-8{_}11383{_}'tis not mortal.
10039-8{_}11384{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11385{_}Why, I have no great skill; but they say it may be dangerous.
10039-8{_}11386{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11387{_}I die with Fear, where is he wounded?
10039-8{_}11388{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11389{_}Why, Madam, he is run--quite through the Heart,--but the Man may live, if I please.
10039-8{_}11390{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11391{_}Thou please!
10039-8{_}11392{_}torment me not with Riddles.
10039-8{_}11393{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11394{_}Why, Madam, there is a certain cordial Balsam, call'd a Fair Lady; which outwardly applied to his Bosom, will prove a better cure than all your Weapon or sympathetick Powder, meaning your Ladyship.
10039-8{_}11395{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11396{_}Is _Cinthio_ then not wounded?
10039-8{_}11397{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11398{_}No otherwise than by your fair Eyes, Madam; he got away unseen and unknown.
10039-8{_}11399{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11400{_}Dost know how precious time is, and dost thou fool it away thus?
10039-8{_}11401{_}What said he to my Letter?
10039-8{_}11402{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11403{_}What should he say?
10039-8{_}11404{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11405{_}Why, a hundred dear soft things of Love, kiss it as often, and bless me for my Goodness.
10039-8{_}11406{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11407{_}Why, so he did.
10039-8{_}11408{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11409{_}Ask thee a thousand Questions of my Health after my last night's fright.
10039-8{_}11410{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11411{_}So he did.
10039-8{_}11412{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11413{_}Expressing all the kind concern Love cou'd inspire, for the Punishment my Father has inflicted on me, for entertaining him at my Window last night.
10039-8{_}11414{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11415{_}All this he did.
10039-8{_}11416{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11417{_}And for my being confin'd a Prisoner to my Apartment, without the hope or almost possibility of seeing him any more.
10039-8{_}11418{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11419{_}There I think you are a little mistaken; for besides the Plot that I have laid to bring you together all this Night,--there are such Stratagems a brewing, not only to bring you together, but with your Father's consent too; such a Plot, Madam--  _Ela_.
10039-8{_}11420{_}Ay, that would be worthy of thy Brain; prithee what?--  _Scar_.
10039-8{_}11421{_}Such a Device--  _Ela_.
10039-8{_}11422{_}I'm impatient.
10039-8{_}11423{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11424{_}Such a Conundrum,--Well, if there be wise Men and Conjurers in the World, they are intriguing Lovers.
10039-8{_}11425{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11426{_}Out with it.
10039-8{_}11427{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11428{_}You must know, Madam, your Father (my Master, the Doctor) is a little whimsical, romantick, or Don-Quicksottish, or so.
10039-8{_}11429{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11430{_}Or rather mad.
10039-8{_}11431{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11432{_}That were uncivil to be supposed by me; but lunatic we may call him, without breaking the Decorum of good Manners; for he is always travelling to the Moon.
10039-8{_}11433{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11434{_}And so religiously believes there is a World there, that he Discourses as gravely of the People, their Government, Institutions, Laws, Manners, Religion, and Constitution, as if he had been bred a _Machiavel_ there.
10039-8{_}11435{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11436{_}How came he thus infected first?
10039-8{_}11437{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11438{_}With reading foolish Books, _Lucian's Dialogue of the Lofty Traveller_, who flew up to the Moon, and thence to Heaven; an heroick Business, call'd _The Man in the Moon_, if you'll believe a _Spaniard_, who was carried thither, upon an Engine drawn by wild Geese; with another Philosophical Piece, _A Discourse of the World in the Moon_; with a thousand other ridiculous Volumes, too hard to name.
10039-8{_}11439{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11440{_}Ay, this reading of Books is a pernicious thing.
10039-8{_}11441{_}I was like to have run mad once, reading Sir _John Mandevil_;--but to the business,--I went, as you know, to Don _Cinthio's_ Lodgings, where I found him with his dear Friend _Charmante_, laying their Heads together for a Farce.
10039-8{_}11442{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11443{_}Farce!
10039-8{_}11444{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11445{_}Ay, a Farce, which shall be call'd,--_The World in the Moon_: Wherein your Father shall be so impos'd on, as shall bring matters most magnificently about.
10039-8{_}11446{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11447{_}I cannot conceive thee, but the Design must be good, since _Cinthio_ and _Charmante_ own it.
10039-8{_}11448{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11449{_}In order to this, _Charmante_ is dressing himself like one of the Caballists of the _Rosycrusian_ Order, and is coming to prepare my credulous Master for the greater Imposition.
10039-8{_}11450{_}I have his Trinkets here to play upon him, which shall be ready.
10039-8{_}11451{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11452{_}But the Farce, where is it to be acted?
10039-8{_}11453{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11454{_}Here, here, in this very House; I am to order the Decorations, adorn a Stage, and place Scenes proper.
10039-8{_}11455{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11456{_}How can this be done without my Father's Knowledge?
10039-8{_}11457{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11458{_}You know the old Apartment next the great Orchard, and the Worm-eaten Gallery that opens to the River; which place for several Years no body has frequented; there all things shall be acted proper for our purpose.
10039-8{_}11459{_}_Enter_ Mopsophil _running_.
10039-8{_}11460{_}_Mop_.
10039-8{_}11461{_}Run, run, _Scaramouch_, my Master's conjuring for you like mad below, he calls up all his little Devils with horrid Names, his Microscope, his Horoscope, his Telescope, and all his Scopes.
10039-8{_}11462{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11463{_}Here, here,--I had almost forgot the Letters; here's one for you, and one for Mrs. _Bellemante_.
10039-8{_}11464{_}[_Runs out_.
10039-8{_}11465{_}_Enter_ Bellemante _with a Book_.
10039-8{_}11466{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11467{_}Here, take my Prayer-Book, _Oh Ma tres chère_.
10039-8{_}11468{_}[_Embraces her_.
10039-8{_}11469{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11470{_}Thy Eyes are always laughing, _Bellemante_.
10039-8{_}11471{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11472{_}And so would yours, had they been so well employ'd as mine, this morning.
10039-8{_}11473{_}I have been at the Chapel, and seen so many Beaus, such a number of Plumeys, I cou'd not tell which I should look on most; sometimes my Heart was charm'd with the gay Blonding, then with the melancholy Noire, anon the amiable Brunet; sometimes the bashful, then again the bold; the little now, anon the lovely tall: In fine, my Dear, I was embarass'd on all sides, I did nothing but deal my Heart _tout autour_.
10039-8{_}11474{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11475{_}Oh, there was then no danger, Cousin.
10039-8{_}11476{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11477{_}No, but abundance of pleasure.
10039-8{_}11478{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11479{_}Why, this is better than sighing for _Charmante_.
10039-8{_}11480{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11481{_}That's when he's present only, and makes his Court to me; I can sigh to a Lover, but will never sigh after him:--but Oh, the Beaus, the Beaus, Cousin, that I saw at Church.
10039-8{_}11482{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11483{_}Oh, you had great devotion to Heaven then!
10039-8{_}11484{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11485{_}And so I had; for I did nothing but admire its Handy-work, but I cou'd not have pray'd heartily, if I had been dying; but a duce on't, who shou'd come in and spoil all but my Lover _Charmante_, so dress'd, so gallant, that he drew together all the scatter'd fragments of my Heart, confin'd my wandering Thoughts, and fixt 'em all on him: Oh, how he look'd, how he was dress'd!
10039-8{_}11486{_}SINGS.
10039-8{_}11487{_}_Chevalier à Cheveux blonds,   Plus de Mouche, plus de Poudre,   Plus de Ribons et Cannons_.
10039-8{_}11488{_}--Oh, what a dear ravishing thing is the beginning of an Amour!
10039-8{_}11489{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11490{_}Thou'rt still in Tune, when wilt thou be tame, _Bellemante_?
10039-8{_}11491{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11492{_}When I am weary of loving, _Elaria_.

10039-8{_}11494{_}To keep up your Humour, here's a Letter from your _Charmante_.

10039-8{_}11496{_}_Malicious Creature, when wilt thou cease to torment   me, and either appear less charming, or more kind?
10039-8{_}11497{_}I languish   when from you, and am wounded when I see you, and yet I am   eternally courting my Pain.
10039-8{_}11498{_}_Cinthio_ and I, are contriving   how we shall see you to Night.
10039-8{_}11499{_}Let us not toil in vain; we   ask but your consent; the Pleasure will be all ours, 'tis therefore   fit we suffer all the Fatigue.
10039-8{_}11500{_}Grant this, and love me, if you   will save the Life of_                                     Your _Charmante_.
10039-8{_}11501{_}--Live then, _Charmante_!
10039-8{_}11502{_}Live as long as Love can last!
10039-8{_}11503{_}_Ela_.
10039-8{_}11504{_}Well, Cousin, _Scaramouch_ tells me of a rare design's a hatching, to relieve us from this Captivity; here are we mew'd up to be espous'd to two Moon-calfs for ought I know; for the Devil of any human thing is suffer'd to come near us without our Governante and Keeper, Mr. _Scaramouch_.
10039-8{_}11505{_}_Bell_.
10039-8{_}11506{_}Who, if he had no more Honesty and Conscience than my Uncle, wou'd let us pine for want of Lovers: but thanks be prais'd, the Generosity of our Cavaliers has open'd their obdurate Hearts with a Golden Key, that lets 'em in at all Opportunities.

10039-8{_}11521{_}I understand, at certain moments critical, one may be snatch'd of such a mighty consequence, to let the Sight into the Secret Closet.

10039-8{_}11524{_}under favour, Sir, that will be something uncivil.

10039-8{_}11527{_}it were flat Treason if it should be known; but thus unseen, and as wise Politicians shou'd, I take survey of all: This is the Statesman's Peeping-hole, thorow which he steals the Secrets of his King, and seems to wink at distance.

10039-8{_}11539{_}from whence?
10039-8{_}11540{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}11541{_}Nay, from the Moon-World, for ought I know, for he looks not like the People of the lower Orb.

10039-8{_}11551{_}Most reverend _Bard_, thrice welcome.
10039-8{_}11552{_}[_Salutes him low_.

10039-8{_}11554{_}The Fame of your great Learning, Sir, and Virtue is known with Joy to the renown'd Society.
10039-8{_}11555{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11556{_}Fame, Sir, has done me too much Honour, to bear my Name to the renown'd _Caballa_.
10039-8{_}11557{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11558{_}You must not attribute it all to Fame, Sir, they are too learned and wise to take up things from Fame, Sir: our Intelligence is by ways more secret and sublime, the Stars, and little Daemons of the Air inform us all things, past, present, and to come.
10039-8{_}11559{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11560{_}I must confess the Count of _Gabalis_ renders it plain, from Writ divine and humane, there are such friendly and intelligent Daemons.
10039-8{_}11561{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11562{_}I hope you do not doubt that Doctrine, Sir, which holds that the Four Elements are peopled with Persons of a Form and Species more divine than vulgar Mortals--those of the fiery Regions we call the _Salamanders_, they beget Kings and Heroes, with Spirits like their Deietical Sires; the lovely Inhabitants of the Water, we call Nymphs; those of the Earth are Gnomes or Fairies; those of the Air are Sylphs.
10039-8{_}11563{_}These, Sir, when in Conjunction with Mortals, beget immortal Races; such as the first-born Man, which had continu'd so, had the first Man ne'er doated on a Woman.
10039-8{_}11564{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11565{_}I am of that opinion, Sir; Man was not made for Woman.
10039-8{_}11566{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11567{_}Most certain, Sir, Man was to have been immortaliz'd by the Love and Conversation of these charming Sylphs and Nymphs, and Women by the Gnomes and Salamanders, and to have stock'd the World with Demi-Gods, such as at this Day inhabit the Empire of the Moon.
10039-8{_}11568{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11569{_}Most admirable Philosophy and Reason!--But do these Sylphs and Nymphs appear in Shapes?
10039-8{_}11570{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11571{_}The most beautiful of all the Sons and Daughters of the Universe: Fancy, Imagination is not half so charming: And then so soft, so kind!
10039-8{_}11572{_}but none but the _Caballa_ and their Families are blest with their divine Addresses.
10039-8{_}11573{_}Were you but once admitted to that Society--  _Doct_.
10039-8{_}11574{_}Ay, Sir, what Virtues or what Merits can accomplish me for that great Honour?
10039-8{_}11575{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11576{_}An absolute abstinence from carnal thought, devout and pure of Spirit; free from Sin.
10039-8{_}11577{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11578{_}I dare not boast my Virtues, Sir; Is there no way to try my Purity?
10039-8{_}11579{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11580{_}Are you very secret?
10039-8{_}11581{_}_Doct_.
10039-8{_}11582{_}'Tis my first Principle, Sir.
10039-8{_}11583{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11584{_}And one, the most material in our _Rosycrusian_ order.--Please you to make a Tryal?

10039-8{_}11586{_}As how, Sir, I beseech you?
10039-8{_}11587{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11588{_}If you be thorowly purg'd from Vice, the Opticles of your Sight will be so illuminated, that glancing through this Telescope, you may behold one of these lovely Creatures, that people the vast Region of the Air.

10039-8{_}11595{_}[_While he is looking_, Charmante _goes to the Door to_ Scaramouch,     _who waited on purpose without, and takes a Glass with a Picture of     a Nymph on it, and a Light behind it; that as he brings it, it shews     to the Audience.
10039-8{_}11596{_}Goes to the end of the Telescope_.
10039-8{_}11597{_}--Can you discern, Sir?

10039-8{_}11599{_}Methinks, I see a kind of glorious Cloud drawn up--and now, 'tis gone again.

10039-8{_}11609{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11610{_}Seems she on a Bed?
10039-8{_}11611{_}then she's reposing, and you must not gaze.

10039-8{_}11615{_}She saw you peeping then, and drew the Curtain of the Air between.

10039-8{_}11618{_}_Char_.
10039-8{_}11619{_}Most possible, Sir; they will court you, their whole delight is to immortalize--_Alexander_ was begot by a Salamander, that visited his Mother in the form of a Serpent, because he would not make King _Philip_ jealous; and that famous Philosopher _Merlin_ was begotten on a Vestal Nun, a certain King's Daughter, by a most beautiful young Salamander; as indeed all the Heroes, and Men of mighty Minds are.

10039-8{_}12914{_}[_Aside_.]

10039-8{_}12921{_}Hum.
10039-8{_}12922{_}_Scar_.
10039-8{_}12923{_}And then the third Region, if the Faeces be volatile, the Birth will soon come _in Balneo_.
10039-8{_}12924{_}This I observed also in the Laboratory of that ingenious Chymist _Lysidono_, and with much Pleasure animadverted that Mineral of the same Zenith and Nadir, of that now so famous Water in _England_, near that famous Metropolis, call'd _Islington_.

10039-8{_}12927{_}For, Sir, upon the Infusion, the Crows Head immediately procures the Seal of _Hermes_; and had not _Lac Virginis_ been too soon suck'd up, I believe we might have seen the Consummation of _Amalgama_.

10039-8{_}13514{_}EPILOGUE,  To be spoken by _Mrs.
10039-8{_}13515{_}Cooke_.
10039-8{_}13516{_}_With our old Plays, as with dull Wife it fares, To whom you have been marry'd tedious Years.
10039-8{_}13517{_}You cry--She's wondrous good, it is confessed,     | But still 'tis_ Chapon Boüillé _at the best;       | That constant Dish can never make a Feast:         | Yet the pall'd Pleasure you must still pursue, You give so small Incouragement for new; And who would drudge for such a wretched Age, Who want the Bravery to support one Stage?
10039-8{_}13518{_}The wiser Wits have now new Measures set, And taken up new Trades that they may hate.
10039-8{_}13519{_}No more your nice fantastick Pleasures serve, Your Pimps you pay, but let your Poets starve, They long in vain for better Usage hop'd, Till quite undone and tir'd, they dropt and dropt; Not one is left will write for thin third Day, Like desperate Pickeroons, no Prize no Pay; And when they have done their best, the Recompence Is, Damn the Sot, his Play wants common Sense, Ill-natured Wits, who can so ill requite The drudging Slaves, who for your Pleasure write.
10039-8{_}13520{_}Look back on flourishing_ Rome, _ye proud Ingrates, And see how she her thriving Poets treats: Wisely she priz'd 'em at the noblest Rate,      | As necessary Ministers of State,                | And Contributions rais'd to make 'em great.
10039-8{_}13521{_}| They from the publick Bank she did maintain, And freed from want, they only writ for Fame; And were as useful in a City held, As formidable Armies in the Field.
10039-8{_}13522{_}They but a Conquest over Men pursued, While these by gentle force the Soul subdu'd.
10039-8{_}13523{_}Not_ Rome _in all her happiest Pomp cou'd show   | A greater_ Caesar _than we boast of now_;        | Augustus _reigns, but Poets still are low.
10039-8{_}13524{_}|  May Caesar live, and while his mighty Hand Is scattering Plenty over all the Land; With God-like Bounty recompensing all, Some fruitful drops may on the Muses fall; Since honest Pens do his just cause afford Equal Advantage with the useful Sword_.

10039-8{_}13875{_}p. 270, l. 12 _Scene V_.

10039-8{_}13888{_}4to 1687 reads 'An After Mach'.
10039-8{_}13889{_}1724 'An after Match'.
10039-8{_}13890{_}As neither of these forms are found, the 4to seems an obvious misprint for 'After Math'.
10039-8{_}13891{_}p. 278, l. 25 _whiffling_.
10039-8{_}13892{_}1724 'whistling'.

10039-8{_}13897{_}It may here be noted that the 1671 quarto swarms with errors and typographical mistakes.

10039-8{_}13905{_}4to 1671 prints 'Alcip.'
10039-8{_}13906{_}as a speech-prefix.
10039-8{_}13907{_}An obvious blunder.
10039-8{_}13908{_}p. 289, l. 18 _Gift_.
10039-8{_}13909{_}4to 1671 misreads 'Guilt'.

10039-8{_}13921{_}Following quartos I have printed these lines (which 1724 gives as prose) metrically, although I confess the result is not satisfactory.

10039-8{_}13923{_}I have added this locale.

10039-8{_}13927{_}This speech, which all previous editions give to Erminia, I have assigned to Aminta.
10039-8{_}13928{_}I am, however, not entirely satisfied that a speech of Galatea's has not dropped out here (the first quarto is notoriously careless), and in this case the speech may well be Erminia's.

10039-8{_}13930{_}4to 1690 and 1724, which I retain as better than 1671 'vow'd'.

10039-8{_}13953{_}I have followed the quartos in their metrical arrangement of this speech.

10039-8{_}13955{_}The same rule has been observed l.21, 'Am.

10039-8{_}13957{_}In this speech and also p. 311, l. 1 I have followed the metrical arrangement of the 4tos.

10039-8{_}13963{_}p. 312, l, 14 _'Tis the most_.
10039-8{_}13964{_}I have followed the two quartos in their arrangement of these lines, which, none the less, seems far from satisfactory.

10039-8{_}13979{_}This is the reading of the 4tos.
10039-8{_}13980{_}I take 'ignorant' as the obsolete substantive.

10039-8{_}14229{_}They roar so loud, you'd think behind the stairs,     Tom Dove, and all the brotherhood of bears.
10039-8{_}14230{_}His prologue to Vanbrugh's alteration of _The Pilgrim_ (1700) begins:--      How wretched is the fate of those who write!
10039-8{_}14231{_}Brought muzzled to the stage, for fear they bite;     Where, like Tom Dove, they stand the common foe.
10039-8{_}14232{_}In Southerne's _The Maid's Last Prayer_ (1693) Act ii, II, Granger on receiving an invitation to dinner cries: 'Zounds!
10039-8{_}14233{_}a man had as good be ty'd to a stake and baited like Tom Dove on Easter Monday as be the necessary appurtenance of a great man's table!'
10039-8{_}14234{_}D'Urfey in the epilogue (spoken by Verbruggen) to Robert Gould's _The Rival Sisters; or, The Violence of Love_, produced at Drury Lane in 1696, writes:--      When the dull Crowd, unskilled in these Affairs,     To day wou'd laugh with us, to morrow with the Bears:     Careless which Pastime did most Witty prove,     Or who pleas'd best, Tom Poet, or Tom Dove.
10039-8{_}14235{_}Tom Dove has been wrongly described as 'a bearward.'

10039-8{_}14237{_}Southampton House, Bloomsbury, occupied the whole of the north side of the present Bloomsbury Square.
10039-8{_}14238{_}It had 'a curious garden behind, which lieth open to the fields,'--_Strype_.
10039-8{_}14239{_}A great rendezvous for duellists, cf.
10039-8{_}14240{_}Epilogue to Mountfort's _Greenwich Park_ (Drury Lane, 1691) spoken by Mrs. Mountfort:--      If you're displeased with what you've seen to-night     Behind Southampton House we'll do you right;     Who is't dares draw 'gainst me and Mrs. Knight?

10039-8{_}14245{_}A quick, lively dance frequently referred to in old dramatists.
10039-8{_}14246{_}p. 43 _A Jigg_.
10039-8{_}14247{_}There were, in Post-Restoration times, two interpretations of the word Jig.
10039-8{_}14248{_}Commonly speaking it was taken to mean exactly what it would now, a simple dance.
10039-8{_}14249{_}Nell Gwynne and Moll Davis were noted for the dancing of Jigs.
10039-8{_}14250{_}cf.
10039-8{_}14251{_}Epilogue to Buckingham's _The Chances_ (1682):--                   The Author dreads the strut and meen     Of new prais'd Poets, having often seen     Some of his Fellows, who have writ before,     When Nel has danc'd her Jig, steal to the Door,     Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that     Swell, and believe themselves the Lord knows what.
10039-8{_}14252{_}Thus at the end of Lacy's _The Old Troop_ (31 July, 1668), we have 'a dance of two hobby horses in armour, and a Jig.'
10039-8{_}14253{_}Also shortly before the epilogue in Shadwell's _The Sullen Lovers_ (1668) we read, 'Enter a Boy in the habit of Pugenello and traverses the stage, takes his chair and sits down, then dances a Jig.'
10039-8{_}14254{_}But it must be remembered that beside the common meaning there was a gloss upon the word derived from Elizabethan stage practice.
10039-8{_}14255{_}In the prologue to _The Fair Maid of the Inn_ (licensed 1626), good plays are spoken of as often scurvily treated, whilst      A Jigge shall be clapt at, and every rhime     Prais'd and applauded by a clam'rous chyme.
10039-8{_}14256{_}The Pre-Restoration Jig was little other indeed than a ballad opera in embryo lasting about twenty-five minutes and given as an after-piece.
10039-8{_}14257{_}It was a rhymed farce in which the dialogue was sung or chanted by the characters to popular ballad tunes.
10039-8{_}14258{_}But after the Restoration the Jig assumed a new and more serious complexion, and came eventually to be dovetailed with the play itself, instead of being given at the fag end of the entertainment.
10039-8{_}14259{_}Mr. W.J.
10039-8{_}14260{_}Lawrence, the well-known theatrical authority to whom I owe much valuable information contained in this note, would (doubtless correctly) attribute the innovation to Stapylton and Edward Howard, both of whom dealt pretty freely in these Jigs.
10039-8{_}14261{_}Stapylton has in Act v of _The Slighted Maid_ (1663) a 'Song in Dialogue' between Aurora and Phoebus with a chorus of Cyclops, which met with some terrible parody in _The Rehearsal_ (cf.
10039-8{_}14262{_}the present editor's edition of _The Rehearsal_, p. 145).
10039-8{_}14263{_}Indeed all extrinsic songs in dialogue, however serious the theme, were considered 'Jigs'.
10039-8{_}14264{_}A striking example would be the Song of the Spirits in Dryden's _Tyrannic Love_, Act iv.
10039-8{_}14265{_}In Post-Restoration days a ballad sung in the streets by two persons was frequently called a Jig, presumably because it was a 'song in dialogue'.
10039-8{_}14266{_}Numerous examples are to be found amongst the Roxburgh Ballads.
10039-8{_}14267{_}The Jig introduced in _Sir Timothy Tawdrey_ would seem to have been the simple dance although not improbably an epithalamium was also sung.
10039-8{_}14268{_}p. 44 _an Entry_.
10039-8{_}14269{_}A dance which derived its name from being performed at that point in a masque when new actors appeared.
10039-8{_}14270{_}In Crowne's _The Country Wit_ (1675) Act iii, I, there is a rather stupid play on this sense of the word confounded with its meaning 'a hall or lobby'.

10039-8{_}14435{_}p. 165 _Aquinius his Case_.
10039-8{_}14436{_}This is, I take it, some confused allusion to the great Dominican Doctor, S. Thomas Aquinas, who was regarded as being the supreme Master of scholasticism and casuistry.
10039-8{_}14437{_}Casuistry must be taken in its true and original meaning--the balancing and deciding of individual cases.
10039-8{_}14438{_}p. 175 _Bantring and Shamming_.
10039-8{_}14439{_}Banter = to chaff or make fun of, at this time a new slang word.
10039-8{_}14440{_}It is almost certain that the verb, which came into use about 1670, was a full decade earlier than the noun.
10039-8{_}14441{_}In 1688 the substantive 'Banter' was up-to-date slang.
10039-8{_}14442{_}For the verb _vide_ D'Urfey's _Madam Fickle_ (1676), Act v, I, where Zechiel cries to his brother: 'Banter him, banter him, Toby.
10039-8{_}14443{_}'Tis a conceited old Scarab, and will yield us excellent sport--go play upon him a little--exercise thy Wit.'

10039-8{_}14445{_}Swift, _Apology_ (1710), _Talke of a Tub_: 'Where wit hath any mixture of raillery, 'tis but calling it banter, and the work is done.
10039-8{_}14446{_}This polite word of theirs was first borrowed from the bullies in Whitefriars, then fell among the footmen, and at last retired to the pedants.'
10039-8{_}14447{_}For 'shamming' cf.
10039-8{_}14448{_}Wycherley's _The Plain Dealer_ (1674), iii, I, where the Lawyer says to Manly: 'You ... shammed me all night long.'
10039-8{_}14449{_}'Shammed!'
10039-8{_}14450{_}cries Manley, 'prithee what barbarous law-term is that?'
10039-8{_}14451{_}'Shamming ...' answers the lawyer, ''tis all our way of wit, Sir.'
10039-8{_}14452{_}And Freeman explains 'Shamming is telling you an insipid dull lie with a dull face, which the sly wag the author only laughs at himself; and making himself believe 'tis a good jest, puts the sham only upon himself.'
10039-8{_}14453{_}p. 176 _Dumfounding_.
10039-8{_}14454{_}A rude and rough form of practical joking.
10039-8{_}14455{_}The players 'dumfounded' each other with sudden blows stealthily dealt.

10039-8{_}14498{_}Dryden and Lee's excellent tragedy was produced at Dorset Garden in 1679.
10039-8{_}14499{_}Betterton created Oedipus and his wife Jocasta.
10039-8{_}14500{_}It was extraordinarily popular, as, indeed, were all the plays Mrs. Behn marshalls forth in this preface.
10039-8{_}14501{_}The scene particularly referred to is Act ii, I: 'Oedipus enters, walking asleep in his Shirt, with a Dagger in his Right-Hand and a Taper in his Left.'

10039-8{_}14511{_}This immensely popular play, five merry side-splitting acts which kept the stage for a century, was produced in 1682 at Dorset Garden.
10039-8{_}14512{_}Ravenscroft has no less than three cuckolds in his Dramatis Personae: Doodle, Dashwell, and Wiseacre.
10039-8{_}14513{_}The intrigues and counter-intrigues are innumerable.

10039-8{_}14515{_}p. 186 _Sir Courtly Nice_.
10039-8{_}14516{_}This witty comedy, Crowne's masterpiece, was produced at the Theatre Royal in 1685.
10039-8{_}14517{_}Mrs. Behn's allusion is to Act ii, II, where Crack, disguised as a tailor, visits Leonora.
10039-8{_}14518{_}The language is often cleverly suggestive.
10039-8{_}14519{_}p. 186 _Sir Fopling_.
10039-8{_}14520{_}Etheredge's third comedy, _The Man of Mode; or, Sir Fopling Flutter_ was produced at the Duke's Theatre in 1676.
10039-8{_}14521{_}It met 'with extraordinary success'.
10039-8{_}14522{_}Mrs. Behn points at Act iv, II.
10039-8{_}14523{_}p. 186 _Valentinian_.
10039-8{_}14524{_}The reference is to the Earl of Rochester's _Valentinian_, altered from Fletcher, which was produced with great applause at the Theatre Royal in 1684.
10039-8{_}14525{_}The Court Bawds, Balbus, Proculus, Chylax, Lycinius, with the 'lewd women belonging to the court', Ardelia and Phorba, are important characters in the tragedy.
10039-8{_}14526{_}The direct allusion is, perhaps, to Act ii, I.

10039-8{_}14530{_}The 'Prologue spoken by Mrs. Cook the first day' is by Mrs. Behn (_vide_ Vol.
10039-8{_}14531{_}VI).
10039-8{_}14532{_}It is certain that an audience which found no offence in Rochester's _Valentinian_ could ill have taken umbrage at the freedoms of _The Lucky Chance_.
10039-8{_}14533{_}p. 186 _The Moor of Venice.
10039-8{_}14534{_}Othello_ was one of the first plays to be revived at the Restoration, and was, perhaps, the most frequently seen of all Shakespeare.
10039-8{_}14535{_}On 11 October, 1660, Burt acted Othello at the Cockpit.
10039-8{_}14536{_}Downes gives Mohun as Iago; Hart, Cassio; Cartwright, Brabantio; Beeston, Roderigo; Mrs. Hughes, Desdemona; Mrs. Rutter, Emilia.
10039-8{_}14537{_}But it is certain Clun had also acted Iago--(Pepys, 6 February, 1668).
10039-8{_}14538{_}Hart soon gave up Cassio to Kynaston for the title rôle in which he is said to have excelled.
10039-8{_}14539{_}After his retirement in 1683 it fell to Betterton, of whose greatness in the part Cibber gives a lively picture.
10039-8{_}14540{_}The _Tatler_ also highly commends this actor's Othello.
10039-8{_}14541{_}p. 186 _The Maids Tragedy_.
10039-8{_}14542{_}Mrs. Behn refers to Act ii, I, and Act iii, I. Hart acted Amintor; Mohun, Melantius; Wintershall, the King; Mrs. Marshall, Evadne.
10039-8{_}14543{_}Rymer particularly praises Hart and Mohun in this tragedy, saying: 'There we have our Roscius and Aesopus both on the stage together.'
10039-8{_}14544{_}After 1683 it was differently cast.
10039-8{_}14545{_}It will be remembered that Melantius was Betterton's last rôle, in which he appeared for his benefit 13 April, 1710, to the Amintor of Wilks and the Evadne of Mrs. Barry.
10039-8{_}14546{_}He died 28 April, a fortnight after.
10039-8{_}14547{_}p. 187 _Wills Coffee House_.
10039-8{_}14548{_}This famous coffee-house was No.
10039-8{_}14549{_}1 Bow Street, Covent Garden, on the west side corner of Russell Street.
10039-8{_}14550{_}It derived its name from Will Unwin who kept it.
10039-8{_}14551{_}The wits' room was upstairs on the first floor.
10039-8{_}14552{_}Some of its reputation was due to the fact that it was a favourite resort of Dryden.
10039-8{_}14553{_}p. 187 _write for a Third day only_.
10039-8{_}14554{_}The whole profits of the third day's performance went to the author of the play; and upon these occasions his friends and patrons would naturally rally to support him.
10039-8{_}14555{_}There are numberless allusions to this custom, especially in Prefaces, Prologues and Epilogues.
10039-8{_}14556{_}p. 189 _the Mall_.
10039-8{_}14557{_}The Mall, St. James's Park, was formed for Charles II, who was very fond of the game 'pall-mall'.
10039-8{_}14558{_}The walk soon became a popular and fashionable resort.
10039-8{_}14559{_}There are innumerable references.
10039-8{_}14560{_}cf.
10039-8{_}14561{_}Prologue, Dryden's _Marriage à la Mode_ (1672):--      Poor pensive punk now peeps ere plays begin,     Sees the bare bench, and dares not venture in;     But manages her last half-crown with care,     And trudges to the Mall, on foot, for air.
10039-8{_}14562{_}The scene of the first Act of Otway's _The Soldier's Fortune_ (1681) is laid in the Mall, and gives a vivid picture of the motley and not over respectable company that was wont to foregather there.
10039-8{_}14563{_}p. 189 _the Ring_.
10039-8{_}14564{_}The Ring, Hyde Park, a favourite ride and promenade was made in the reign of Charles I.
10039-8{_}14565{_}It was very fashionable, and is frequently alluded to in poem and play.

10039-8{_}14573{_}p. 193 _Starter_.
10039-8{_}14574{_}This slang word usually means a milksop, but here it is equivalent to 'a butterfly', 'a weathercock'--a man of changeable disposition.
10039-8{_}14575{_}A rare use.
10039-8{_}14576{_}p. 193 _Finsbury Hero_, Finsbury Fields, which Pepys thought 'very pleasant', had been kept open for the citizens to practise archery.
10039-8{_}14577{_}An ordinance of 1478 is extant which orders all obstacles to be removed and Finsbury to be 'made a plain field for archers to shoot in'.
10039-8{_}14578{_}As late as 1737 there were standing twenty-four 'rovers' or stone pillars for shooting at distances.
10039-8{_}14579{_}p. 196 _Mr.
10039-8{_}14580{_}Barnardine_.
10039-8{_}14581{_}This allusion must almost certainly be to a recent revival of _Measure for Measure_, which particular play had been amongst those set aside by the regulation of 12 December, 1660, as the special property of Davenant's theatre.
10039-8{_}14582{_}After the amalgamation of the two companies in November, 1682, a large number of the older plays were revived or continued to be played (with a new cast and Betterton in the rôles which had been Hart's) during the subsequent decade.
10039-8{_}14583{_}Downes mentions _Othello, The Taming of the Shrew_, and several by Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Brome.
10039-8{_}14584{_}On the other hand, it is possible this reference may merely be to _The Law Against Lovers_ (1661, folio, 1673), in which Sir William Davenant has mixed Benedick and Beatrice with Angelo, Claudio, Isabella and the rest.
10039-8{_}14585{_}It is a curious conglomeration, and the result is very pitiful and disastrous.
10039-8{_}14586{_}Bernardine and the prison scenes are retained.
10039-8{_}14587{_}_Measure for Measure_ was again profanely altered by Gildon in 1700, mutilated and helped out by 'entertainments of music'.

10039-8{_}14592{_}The celebrated Spital Sermons were originally preached at a pulpit cross in the churchyard (now Spital Square) of the Priory and Hospital of St. Mary Spital, founded 1197.
10039-8{_}14593{_}The cross, broken at the Reformation, was rebuilt during Charles I's reign, but destroyed during the Great Rebellion.
10039-8{_}14594{_}The sermons, however, have been continued to the present time and are still preached every Easter Monday and Easter Tuesday before the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, at Christ Church, Newgate Street.
10039-8{_}14595{_}P. 201.
10039-8{_}14596{_}_Alsatia_.
10039-8{_}14597{_}This cant name had been given to the precinct of Whitefriars before 1623, then and for many years a notorious refuge for persons wishing to avoid bailiffs and creditors.
10039-8{_}14598{_}The earliest use of the name is Thomas Towel's quarto tract, _Wheresoever you see meet, Trust unto Yourselfe: or the Mysterie of Lending and Borrowing_ (1623).
10039-8{_}14599{_}The second use in point of time is the Prologue to Settle's _Pastor Fido_ (1676):--      And when poor Duns, quite weary, will not stay;     The hopeless Squire's into _Alsatia_ driven.
10039-8{_}14600{_}Otway's comedy, _The Soldiers Fortune_ (4to, 1681), where Courtine says: 'I shall be ere long as greasy as an Alsatian bully,' comes third; and Mrs. Behn's reference to Alsatia in this play, which is often ignored, claims fourth place.
10039-8{_}14601{_}We then have Shadwell's famous comedy, _The Squire of Alsatia_ (1688), with its well-known vocabulary of Alsatian jargon and slang, its scenes in Whitefriars, the locus classicus, a veritable mine of information.
10039-8{_}14602{_}The particular portions of Whitefriars forming Alsatia were Ram-Alley, Mitre Court, and a lane called in the local cant Lombard Street.
10039-8{_}14603{_}No.
10039-8{_}14604{_}50 of Tempest's _Cries of London_ (drawn and published in James II's reign) is called 'A Squire of Alsatia', and represents a fashionable young gallant.
10039-8{_}14605{_}Steele, _Tatler_ (No.
10039-8{_}14606{_}66), 10 September, 1709, speaks of Alsatia 'now in ruins'.
10039-8{_}14607{_}It is interesting to note that many authorities, ignoring Settle and Mrs. Behn's allusions, quote Powel and Otway as the only two places where the word 'Alsatia' is found before Shadwell made it so popular.

10039-8{_}14614{_}Henry VIII had been put on by Davenant in December, 1663 with a wealth of pomp and expenditure that became long proverbial in the theatrical world.
10039-8{_}14615{_}An extra large number of supers were engaged.
10039-8{_}14616{_}Downes dilates at quite unusual length upon the magnificence of the new scenery and costumes.
10039-8{_}14617{_}The court scene was especially crowded with 'the Lords, the Cardinals, the Bishops, the Doctors, Proctors, Lawyers, Tip-staves.'
10039-8{_}14618{_}On New Year's Day, 1664, Pepys went to the Duke's house and saw 'the so much cried up play of Henry VIII; which tho' I went with resolution to like it, is so simple a thing, made up of a great many patches, that, besides the shows and processions in it, there is nothing in the world good or well done.'
10039-8{_}14619{_}On 30 December, 1668, however, he saw it again, 'and was mightily pleased, better than ever I expected, with the history and shows of it.'
10039-8{_}14620{_}In _The Rehearsal_ (1671), Act v, I, Bayes says: 'I'l shew you the greatest scene that ever England saw: I mean not for words, for those I do not value; but for state, shew, and magnificence.

10039-8{_}14692{_}p. 212 _this old Sir Guy of Warwick_.
10039-8{_}14693{_}Sir Guy of Warwick is an old slang name for a sword; a rapier.
10039-8{_}14694{_}The name is taken from the romance (of which there were many versions) and which proved extraordinarily popular.
10039-8{_}14695{_}It was first licensed 'in prose by Martyn Parker' to Oulton, 24 November, 1640.
10039-8{_}14696{_}Smithson's version was first printed in black letter, and a second edition appeared in 1686.
10039-8{_}14697{_}John Shurley's version was published 4to, 1681 and again 1685.
10039-8{_}14698{_}Esdalle, _English Tales and Romances_, enumerates sixteen versions, editions and abridgements, concluding with 'The Seventh Edition' 12mo, 1733.  p. 214 _Enter Bredwel_.
10039-8{_}14699{_}Lady Fulbank supplying Gayman with money through the medium of Bredwel 'drest like a Devil' is reminiscent of incidents in Dryden's first comedy, _The Wild Gallant_ (1663, and revised version, 1667; 4to, 1667), where Lady Constance employs Setstone, a jeweller, to accomodate Loveby with ready cash.
10039-8{_}14700{_}Loveby is benefited to the tune of two hundred and fifty pounds, which are filched from the study of old Lord Nonsuch, who complains in much the same way as Sir Cautious.
10039-8{_}14701{_}Loveby declares it must be the devil who has enriched him, and forthwith rescues his 'Suit with the Gold Lace at Sleeves from Tribulation.'
10039-8{_}14702{_}Owing to his poverty he has been unable to visit Constance, and when he appears before her in his gay clothes he excuses his fortnight's absence by saying, I have been 'out of Town to see a little thing that's fallen to me upon the Death of a Grandmother.'
10039-8{_}14703{_}In Act i of _The Wild Gallant_ Loveby gives Bibber a humorous description of a garret, which may be paralleled with Bredwel's 'lewd' picture of Cayman's chamber--_The Lucky Chance_, Act i, II.
10039-8{_}14704{_}It must be allowed that Mrs. Behn bears away the palm in this witty passage.
10039-8{_}14705{_}_The Wild Gallant_ is, by Dryden's own confession (cf.
10039-8{_}14706{_}the First Prologue), founded on a Spanish plot.
10039-8{_}14707{_}In the Preface he says: 'The Plot was not Originally my own: But so alter'd by me, (whether for better or worse, I know not) that, whoever the Author was, he could not have challeng'd a Scene of it.'
10039-8{_}14708{_}So vast, indeed, is the library of the Spanish Theatre that it has not as yet been identified, a task which in view of the author's own statement may well be deemed nigh impossible.
10039-8{_}14709{_}Recent critics have pertinently suggested that the device of furnishing Loveby with money was the chief hint for which Dryden is indebted to Spain.
10039-8{_}14710{_}The conduct of the amour between Lady Fulbank and Gayman, founded as it is on Shirley's _The Lady of Pleasure_, has nothing in common with Otway's intrigue between Beaugard and Portia--_The Atheist_ (1683)--which owes itself to Scarron's novel, _The Invisible Mistress_.

10039-8{_}14736{_}This merry old matrimonial custom in use at the bedding of the happy pair is often alluded to.
10039-8{_}14737{_}cf.
10039-8{_}14738{_}Pepys, 8 February, 1663: 'Another story was how Lady Castlemaine, a few days since, had Mrs. Stewart to an entertainment, and at night begun a frolique that they two must be married; and married they were, with ring and all other ceremonies of church service, and ribbands, and a sack posset in bed and flinging the stocking; but in the close it is said my Lady Castlemaine, who was the bridegroom, rose, and the King come and take her place.'
10039-8{_}14739{_}p. 224 _the Entry_.
10039-8{_}14740{_}In the Restoration theatre it was the usual practice for the curtain to rise at the commencement and fall at the end of the play, so that the close of each intermediate act was only marked by a clear stage.
10039-8{_}14741{_}There are, however, exceptions to this rule, more particularly when some elaborate set or Tableau began a new act.
10039-8{_}14742{_}A striking example is Act ii, _The Forc'd Marriage_.
10039-8{_}14743{_}p. 224 _Mr.
10039-8{_}14744{_}Cheek_.
10039-8{_}14745{_}Thomas Cheek was a well-known wit and songwriter of the day.
10039-8{_}14746{_}His name not infrequently occurs to the graceful lyrics with which he supplied the theatre.
10039-8{_}14747{_}There are some pretty lines of his, 'Corinna, I excuse thy face', in Act v of Southerne's _The Wives Excuse; or, Cuckolds make Themselves_ (1692); and a still better song, 'Bright Cynthia's pow'r divinely great,' which was sung by Leveridge in the second act of Southerne's _Oroonoko_ (1699), came from his prolific pen.
10039-8{_}14748{_}p. 225 _Bandstrings_.
10039-8{_}14749{_}Strings for fastening his bands or collar which were in the seventeenth century frequently ornamented with tassels, cf.
10039-8{_}14750{_}Selden, Table-Talk (1689): 'If a man twirls his Bandstrings'; and Wood, _Ath.
10039-8{_}14751{_}Oxon_.
10039-8{_}14752{_}(1691): 'He [wore] snakebone bandstrings (or bandstrings with huge tassels).'
10039-8{_}14753{_}p. 225 _yare_.
10039-8{_}14754{_}Eager; ready; prepared from A.-S. geáro.
10039-8{_}14755{_}cf.
10039-8{_}14756{_}_Measure for Measure_, iv, II: 'You shall find me yare'; and _The Tempest_, i, I: 'Cheerly, my hearts!
10039-8{_}14757{_}yare, yare!
10039-8{_}14758{_}'; also Act v, sc.
10039-8{_}14759{_}I: 'Our ship ... is tight and yare.'
10039-8{_}14760{_}Also _Antony and Cleopatra_, v, II: 'yare, yare, good Iras; quick.'
10039-8{_}14761{_}Ray gives it as a Suffolk word, and the 'hear, hear' of Lowestoft boatmen of to-day is probably a disguised 'yare, yare'.
10039-8{_}14762{_}p. 226 _Livery and Seisin_.
10039-8{_}14763{_}A very common error for the legal term 'livery of seisin' which signifies the delivery of property into the corporal possession of a person.
10039-8{_}14764{_}p. 251 _Song.
10039-8{_}14765{_}Oh!
10039-8{_}14766{_}Love_.
10039-8{_}14767{_}Mr. Bullen, who includes this 'impassioned song' in his _Musa Proterva: Love-Poems of the Restoration_ (1889), has the following note: 'Did Mrs. Behn write these fine verses?...
10039-8{_}14768{_}Henry Playford, a well-known publisher of music, issued in the same year [1687] the Fourth Book of _The Theatre of Music_, where "O Love, that stronger art" appeared with the heading "The Song in Madam Bhen's last New Play, sung by Mr.
10039-8{_}14769{_}Bowman, set by Dr. John Blow."
10039-8{_}14770{_}At the end of the song Playford adds, "These words by Mr.
10039-8{_}14771{_}Ousley."
10039-8{_}14772{_}... Mrs. Behn usually acknowledged her obligations; but she may have been neglectful on the present occasion.
10039-8{_}14773{_}Ousley's claim cannot be lightly set aside.'
10039-8{_}14774{_}There is nothing to add to this, and we can only say that Aphra Behn had such true lyric genius that 'Oh!
10039-8{_}14775{_}Love that stronger art' is in no way beyond her.
10039-8{_}14776{_}A statement which neither disposes of nor invalidates Ousley's claim based, as this is, upon such strong and definite evidence.
10039-8{_}14777{_}John Bowman (or Boman) who acted Bredwel had 'as a boy' joined the Duke's Company about 1673.
10039-8{_}14778{_}He was, says Cibber, in the days of Charles II 'a Youth fam'd for his Voice', and he often sang before the King, no indifferent judge of music.
10039-8{_}14779{_}Bowman's name appears as Peter Santlow in _The Counterfeit Bridegroom; or, the Defeated Widow_ (1677).
10039-8{_}14780{_}He soon became an actor of considerable merit, and created Tattle in _Love for Love_ (1695).
10039-8{_}14781{_}He is said to have remained on the stage for the extraordinary period of sixty-five years, and to have played within a few months of his death.
10039-8{_}14782{_}Davies speaks highly of his acting, even in extreme old age.
10039-8{_}14783{_}Oldys (MS. note on Langbaine) refers to him as 'old Mr. John Bowman'.
10039-8{_}14784{_}Cibber, in his _Apology_ (1740), speaks of '_Boman_ the late Actor of venerable Memory'.
10039-8{_}14785{_}p. 234 _half Pike_.
10039-8{_}14786{_}'Now _Hist_.
10039-8{_}14787{_}A small pike having a shaft of one half the length of the full-sized one.
10039-8{_}14788{_}There were two kinds; one, also called a _spontoon_, formerly carried by infantry officers; the other, used on ships for repelling boarders, a boarding-pike,'--_N.E.D_.
10039-8{_}14789{_}which quotes (inter alia) Massinger, &c., _Old Law_ (4to, 1656), Act iii, II: 'Here's a half-pike'; and Froger, _Voyages_ (1698): 'Their ordinary Arms are the Hanger, the Sagary (assagai), which is a very light Half-Pike.'
10039-8{_}14790{_}p. 245 _Geometry_.
10039-8{_}14791{_}A colloquial term for magic.
10039-8{_}14792{_}p. 247 _a Sirreverence under your Girdle_.
10039-8{_}14793{_}'To have an M under (or by) the Girdle' was a proverbial expression = to have a courteous address by using the titles Mr., Mrs., Miss, &c. cf.

10039-8{_}14798{_}Sir- (or Save-) Reverence is an old and very common colloquialism.
10039-8{_}14799{_}It was the most usual form of apology when mentioning anything likely to offend, or naming a word for which excuse was thought proper or necessary.
10039-8{_}14800{_}Wherefore it came to stand in place of various words of obscene sound or meaning.
10039-8{_}14801{_}There are innumerable instances from Mandeville (1356); down to recent times, and even Devonshire dialect to-day.
10039-8{_}14802{_}p. 248 _the George in White-Fryers_.
10039-8{_}14803{_}The George tavern was situated in Dogwell Court, and some little time after the abolition of the vicious privileges of Alsatia by the Act 8 and 9 William III, c. 27 (1697), it was converted into the printing office of William Bowyer, the elder.
10039-8{_}14804{_}These premises were destroyed by fire, 30 January, 1713.
10039-8{_}14805{_}Scene II, Act i of Shadwell's _The Squire of Alsatia_ (1688), is laid 'at the George in Whitefriars'.
10039-8{_}14806{_}p. 249 _he cullies_.
10039-8{_}14807{_}To cully = to cheat; trick.
10039-8{_}14808{_}Although the verb, which came into use circa 1670, and persisted for a full century, is rare, the substantive 'a cully' (= a fool) is very common.
10039-8{_}14809{_}For the verb, cf.
10039-8{_}14810{_}Pomfret, _Poems_ (1699), _Divine Attributes_: 'Tricks to cully fools.'
10039-8{_}14811{_}p. 249 _he pads_.
10039-8{_}14812{_}The substantive 'pad' = a path or highway.
10039-8{_}14813{_}Bailey (1730-6) has 'to Pad ... to rob on the road on foot.'
10039-8{_}14814{_}cf.
10039-8{_}14815{_}Ford's _The Lady's Trial_ (1639), v, I: 'One can ... pick a pocket, Pad for a cloak or hat'; and also Cotton Mather's _Discourse on Witchcraft_ (1689), chap, vii: 'As if you or I should say: We never met with any robbers on the road, therefore there never was any Padding there.'
10039-8{_}14816{_}p. 250 _sport a Dye_.
10039-8{_}14817{_}To play at dice.
10039-8{_}14818{_}'To sport', generic for 'to parade' or 'display' was, and is a very common phrase.
10039-8{_}14819{_}It is especially found in public school and university slang.
10039-8{_}14820{_}This is a very early example.

10039-8{_}14938{_}Somewhat similar, though by no means such complete, examples may be seen in Orrery's _Henry the Fifth_ (1664), at the commencement of Act iv, and again in the same author's _The Black Prince_ (19 October, 1667), Act ii.
10039-8{_}14939{_}It must be confessed that Mrs. Behn has made an excellent use of this technical contrivance.
10039-8{_}14940{_}In the Restoration theatre it was the usual practice for the curtain to rise at the beginning and fall at the end of the play, so that the close of each intermediate act was only shown by a clear stage.

10039-8{_}14974{_}I.
10039-8{_}14975{_}It is very possible that Mrs. Behn hence took her hint for the phantom of the living Erminia.
10039-8{_}14976{_}It is noticeable that generations after Tobin borrowed not a few incidents from _The Lost Lady_ for _The Curfew_, produced at Drury Lane, 19 February, 1807, a posthumous play.

10039-8{_}15249{_}Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
10039-8{_}15250{_}It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
10039-8{_}15251{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10039-8{_}15252{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
10039-8{_}15253{_}To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

10039-8{_}15262{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10039-8{_}15263{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10039-8{_}15264{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10039-8{_}15265{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
10039-8{_}15266{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
10039-8{_}15267{_}To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
10039-8{_}15268{_}International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
10039-8{_}15269{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
10039-8{_}15270{_}Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
10039-8{_}15271{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10039-8{_}15273{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10039-8{_}15274{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10039-8{_}15275{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10039-8{_}15276{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10039-8{_}15277{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10039-8{_}15278{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10039-8{_}15279{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10039-8{_}15280{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10039-8{_}15281{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10039-8{_}15282{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10039-8{_}15283{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10039-8{_}15284{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10039-8{_}15285{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10039-8{_}15286{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10039-8{_}15287{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10039-8{_}15288{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10039-8{_}15289{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
