10136-8{_}8{_}PREFACE.
10136-8{_}9{_}I must frankly own, that if I had known, beforehand, that this book would have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been courageous enough to commence it.
10136-8{_}10{_}What moved me, in the first instance, to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement.
10136-8{_}11{_}I have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways.
10136-8{_}12{_}Men are now so well served out of doors,--at their clubs, well-ordered taverns, and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the attractions of these places, a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery, as well as be perfectly conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable home.
10136-8{_}13{_}In this book I have attempted to give, under the chapters devoted to cookery, an intelligible arrangement to every recipe, a list of the _ingredients_, a plain statement of the _mode_ of preparing each dish, and a careful estimate of its _cost_, the _number of people_ for whom it is _sufficient_, and the time when it is _seasonable_.
10136-8{_}14{_}For the matter of the recipes, I am indebted, in some measure, to many correspondents of the "Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine," who have obligingly placed at my disposal their formulas for many original preparations.
10136-8{_}15{_}A large private circle has also rendered me considerable service.
10136-8{_}16{_}A diligent study of the works of the best modern writers on cookery was also necessary to the faithful fulfilment of my task.
10136-8{_}17{_}Friends in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Germany, have also very materially aided me.
10136-8{_}18{_}I have paid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of "COLD MEAT COOKERY."
10136-8{_}19{_}But in the department belonging to the Cook I have striven, too, to make my work something more than a Cookery Book, and have, therefore, on the best authority that I could obtain, given an account of the natural history of the animals and vegetables which we use as food.
10136-8{_}20{_}I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance on the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying him, the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes, have described the modes of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game.
10136-8{_}21{_}Skilful artists have designed the numerous drawings which appear in this work, and which illustrate, better than any description, many important and interesting items.
10136-8{_}22{_}The coloured plates are a novelty not without value.
10136-8{_}23{_}Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cook's department, there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household, who have all, I trust, their duties clearly assigned to them.
10136-8{_}24{_}Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the "Management of Children"----"The Doctor," the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain to occur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter contains "Legal Memoranda," which will be serviceable in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord and Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer.
10136-8{_}25{_}These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to confidence; those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the legal matter by a solicitor.
10136-8{_}26{_}I wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have received during the progress of this work, and have only further to add, that I trust the result of the four years' incessant labour which I have expended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen and countrywomen.

10136-8{_}84{_}CHAPTER I.
10136-8{_}85{_}THE MISTRESS.
10136-8{_}86{_}"Strength, and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
10136-8{_}87{_}She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
10136-8{_}88{_}She looketh well to the ways of her household; and eateth not the bread of idleness.
10136-8{_}89{_}Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her."
10136-8{_}90{_}--_Proverbs_, xxxi.
10136-8{_}91{_}25-28.
10136-8{_}92{_}I.
10136-8{_}93{_}AS WITH THE COMMANDER OF AN ARMY, or the leader of any enterprise, so is it with the mistress of a house.
10136-8{_}94{_}Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path.
10136-8{_}95{_}Of all those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of a family.
10136-8{_}96{_}In this opinion we are borne out by the author of "The Vicar of Wakefield," who says: "The modest virgin, the prudent wife, and the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens.
10136-8{_}97{_}She who makes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies described in romances, whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver, or their eyes."
10136-8{_}98{_}2.
10136-8{_}99{_}PURSUING THIS PICTURE, we may add, that to be a good housewife does not necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing recreation; and we think it the more necessary to express this, as the performance of the duties of a mistress may, to some minds, perhaps seem to be incompatible with the enjoyment of life.
10136-8{_}100{_}Let us, however, now proceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are necessary to the proper management of a Household, and then point out the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily regulation of its affairs.
10136-8{_}101{_}3.
10136-8{_}102{_}EARLY RISING IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUALITIES which enter into good Household Management, as it is not only the parent of health, but of innumerable other advantages.
10136-8{_}103{_}Indeed, when a mistress is an early riser, it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and well-managed.
10136-8{_}104{_}On the contrary, if she remain in bed till a late hour, then the domestics, who, as we have before observed, invariably partake somewhat of their mistress's character, will surely become sluggards.
10136-8{_}105{_}To self-indulgence all are more or less disposed, and it is not to be expected that servants are freer from this fault than the heads of houses.
10136-8{_}106{_}The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this subject:--"I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed, and the walls of your chamber, 'If you do not rise early, you can make progress in nothing.'"
10136-8{_}107{_}4.
10136-8{_}108{_}CLEANLINESS IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE TO HEALTH, and must be studied both in regard to the person and the house, and all that it contains.
10136-8{_}109{_}Cold or tepid baths should be employed every morning, unless, on account of illness or other circumstances, they should be deemed objectionable.
10136-8{_}110{_}The bathing of _children_ will be treated of under the head of "MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN."
10136-8{_}111{_}5.
10136-8{_}112{_}FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES, without which no household can prosper.
10136-8{_}113{_}Dr. Johnson says: "Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence, the sister of Temperance, and the parent of Liberty.
10136-8{_}114{_}He that is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption."
10136-8{_}115{_}The necessity of practising economy should be evident to every one, whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a family's requirements, or of a large fortune, which puts financial adversity out of the question.
10136-8{_}116{_}We must always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well.
10136-8{_}117{_}"He is a good waggoner," says Bishop Hall, "that can turn in a little room.
10136-8{_}118{_}To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate, not of the person.
10136-8{_}119{_}I will study more how to give a good account of my little, than how to make it more."
10136-8{_}120{_}In this there is true wisdom, and it may be added, that those who can manage a little well, are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters.
10136-8{_}121{_}Economy and frugality must never, however, be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness.
10136-8{_}122{_}6.
10136-8{_}123{_}THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family.
10136-8{_}124{_}A gossiping acquaintance, who indulges in the scandal and ridicule of her neighbours, should be avoided as a pestilence.
10136-8{_}125{_}It is likewise all-necessary to beware, as Thomson sings,                                   "The whisper'd tale,   That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows;--   Fair-laced Deceit, whose wily, conscious aye   Ne'er looks direct; the tongue that licks the dust   But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting."
10136-8{_}126{_}If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress, society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the mutual interchange of general and interesting information.
10136-8{_}127{_}7.
10136-8{_}128{_}FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED, nor the heart given, at once, to every new-comer.
10136-8{_}129{_}There are ladies who uniformly smile at, and approve everything and everybody, and who possess neither the courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to defend virtue.
10136-8{_}130{_}The friendship of such persons is without attachment, and their love without affection or even preference.
10136-8{_}131{_}They imagine that every one who has any penetration is ill-natured, and look coldly on a discriminating judgment.
10136-8{_}132{_}It should be remembered, however, that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, scrutinize the conduct and dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first fair appearances.
10136-8{_}133{_}Addison, who was not deficient in a knowledge of mankind, observes that "a friendship, which makes the least noise, is very often the most useful; for which reason, I should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one."
10136-8{_}134{_}And Joanna Baillie tells us that    "Friendship is no plant of hasty growth,    Though planted in esteem's deep-fixed soil,    The gradual culture of kind intercourse    Must bring it to perfection."
10136-8{_}135{_}8.
10136-8{_}136{_}HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE; but care must be taken that the love of company, for its own sake, does not become a prevailing passion; for then the habit is no longer hospitality, but dissipation.
10136-8{_}137{_}Reality and truthfulness in this, as in all other duties of life, are the points to be studied; for, as Washington Irving well says, "There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality, which cannot be described, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his ease."
10136-8{_}138{_}With respect to the continuance of friendships, however, it may be found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life.
10136-8{_}139{_}This will be the more requisite, if the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities.
10136-8{_}140{_}9.
10136-8{_}141{_}IN CONVERSATION, TRIFLING OCCURRENCES, such as small disappointments, petty annoyances, and other every-day incidents, should never be mentioned to your friends.
10136-8{_}142{_}The extreme injudiciousness of repeating these will be at once apparent, when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions which they too frequently occasion, and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being tendered, and which is, too often, of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable.
10136-8{_}143{_}Greater events, whether of joy or sorrow, should be communicated to friends; and, on such occasions, their sympathy gratifies and comforts.
10136-8{_}144{_}If the mistress be a wife, never let an account of her husband's failings pass her lips; and in cultivating the power of conversation, she should keep the versified advice of Cowper continually in her memory, that it    "Should flow like water after summer showers,    Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers."
10136-8{_}145{_}In reference to its style, Dr. Johnson, who was himself greatly distinguished for his colloquial abilities, says that "no style is more extensively acceptable than the narrative, because this does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company; and, therefore, is most likely to please them.
10136-8{_}146{_}For this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history.
10136-8{_}147{_}Almost every one listens with eagerness to extemporary history.
10136-8{_}148{_}Vanity often co-operates with curiosity; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company; and therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else in conversation.
10136-8{_}149{_}It is true, indeed, that sallies of wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation; but they frequently tend to raise envy in some of the company: but the narrative way neither raises this, nor any other evil passion, but keeps all the company nearly upon an equality, and, if judiciously managed, will at once entertain and improve them all."
10136-8{_}150{_}10.
10136-8{_}151{_}GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress, as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn; indeed, its influence can hardly be over-estimated, as it has the effect of moulding the characters of those around her, and of acting most beneficially on the happiness of the domestic circle.
10136-8{_}152{_}Every head of a household should strive to be cheerful, and should never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the well-being of those who claim the protection of her roof.
10136-8{_}153{_}Gentleness, not partial and temporary, but universal and regular, should pervade her conduct; for where such a spirit is habitually manifested, it not only delights her children, but makes her domestics attentive and respectful; her visitors are also pleased by it, and their happiness is increased.
10136-8{_}154{_}11.
10136-8{_}155{_}ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF DRESS AND FASHION we cannot do better than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the "Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine."
10136-8{_}156{_}The writer there says, "Let people write, talk, lecture, satirize, as they may, it cannot be denied that, whatever is the prevailing mode in attire, let it intrinsically be ever so absurd, it will never _look_ as ridiculous as another, or as any other, which, however convenient, comfortable, or even becoming, is totally opposite in style to that generally worn."
10136-8{_}157{_}12.
10136-8{_}158{_}IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL, whether it be a silk dress, a bonnet, shawl, or riband, it is well for the buyer to consider three things: I.
10136-8{_}159{_}That it be not too expensive for her purse.
10136-8{_}160{_}II.
10136-8{_}161{_}That its colour harmonize with her complexion, and its size and pattern with her figure.
10136-8{_}162{_}III.
10136-8{_}163{_}That its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses.
10136-8{_}164{_}The quaint Fuller observes, that the good wife is none of our dainty dames, who love to appear in a variety of suits every day new, as if a gown, like a stratagem in war, were to be used but once.
10136-8{_}165{_}But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husband's estate; and, if of high parentage, she doth not so remember what she was by birth, that she forgets what she is by match.
10136-8{_}166{_}To _Brunettes_, or those ladies having dark complexions, silks     of a grave hue are adapted.
10136-8{_}167{_}For _Blondes_, or those having fair     complexions, lighter colours are preferable, as the richer,     deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter.
10136-8{_}168{_}The colours     which go best together are green with violet; gold-colour with     dark crimson or lilac; pale blue with scarlet; pink with black     or white; and gray with scarlet or pink.
10136-8{_}169{_}A cold colour generally     requires a warm tint to give life to it.
10136-8{_}170{_}Gray and pale blue, for     instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours.
10136-8{_}171{_}13.
10136-8{_}172{_}THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her circumstances, and be varied with different occasions.
10136-8{_}173{_}Thus, at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner, wearing no ornaments.
10136-8{_}174{_}If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfast-hour, and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal, then it would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors, if the mistress be in the habit of doing so.
10136-8{_}175{_}It is still to be remembered, however, that, in changing the dress, jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed.
10136-8{_}176{_}Further information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the "LADY'S-MAID."
10136-8{_}177{_}The advice of Polonius to his son Laertes, in Shakspeare's     tragedy of "Hamlet," is most excellent; and although given to     one of the male sex, will equally apply to a "fayre ladye:"--    "Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;    For the apparel oft proclaims the man."
10136-8{_}178{_}14.
10136-8{_}179{_}CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellow-creatures; and there is scarcely any income so small, but something may be spared from it, even if it be but "the widow's mite."
10136-8{_}180{_}It is to be always remembered, however, that it is the _spirit_ of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amount, and is by far its better part.
10136-8{_}181{_}True Charity, a plant divinely nursed,   Fed by the love from which it rose at first,   Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene,   Storms but enliven its unfading green;   Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies,   Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies.
10136-8{_}182{_}Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really     to understand the actual state of each family; and although     there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the     metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and     rural districts these objections do not obtain.
10136-8{_}183{_}Great advantages     may result from visits paid to the poor; for there being,     unfortunately, much ignorance, generally, amongst them with     respect to all household knowledge, there will be opportunities     for advising and instructing them, in a pleasant and unobtrusive     manner, in cleanliness, industry, cookery, and good management.
10136-8{_}184{_}15.
10136-8{_}185{_}IN MARKETING, THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST, may be laid down as a rule; and it is desirable, unless an experienced and confidential housekeeper be kept, that the mistress should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house.
10136-8{_}186{_}If the mistress be a young wife, and not accustomed to order "things for the house," a little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with, and what are the best provisions to buy.
10136-8{_}187{_}Under each particular head of FISH, MEAT, POULTRY, GAME, &c., will be described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles.
10136-8{_}188{_}16.
10136-8{_}189{_}A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT-BOOK should invariably be kept, and kept punctually and precisely.
10136-8{_}190{_}The plan for keeping household accounts, which we should recommend, would be to make an entry, that is, write down into a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day, be it ever so small; then, at the end of the month, let these various payments be ranged under their specific heads of Butcher, Baker, &c.; and thus will be seen the proportions paid to each tradesman, and any one month's expenses may be contrasted with another.
10136-8{_}191{_}The housekeeping accounts should be balanced not less than once a month; so that you may see that the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your diary.
10136-8{_}192{_}Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said, "No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means, and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his outgoings."
10136-8{_}193{_}When, in a large establishment, a housekeeper is kept, it will     be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly.
10136-8{_}194{_}Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent, can     easily be explained, and the housekeeper will have the     satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her     department well and economically, have been successful.
10136-8{_}195{_}17.
10136-8{_}196{_}ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of the mistress must be keenly exercised.
10136-8{_}197{_}There are some respectable registry-offices, where good servants may sometimes be hired; but the plan rather to be recommended is, for the mistress to make inquiry amongst her circle of friends and acquaintances, and her tradespeople.
10136-8{_}198{_}The latter generally know those in their neighbourhood, who are wanting situations, and will communicate with them, when a personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters of the applicants, and to suit herself accordingly.
10136-8{_}199{_}We would here point out an error--and a grave one it is--into     which some mistresses fall.
10136-8{_}200{_}They do not, when engaging a     servant, expressly tell her all the duties which she will be     expected to perform.
10136-8{_}201{_}This is an act of omission severely to be     reprehended.
10136-8{_}202{_}Every portion of work which the maid will have to     do, should be plainly stated by the mistress, and understood by     the servant.
10136-8{_}203{_}If this plan is not carefully adhered to, domestic     contention is almost certain to ensue, and this may not be     easily settled; so that a change of servants, which is so much     to be deprecated, is continually occurring.
10136-8{_}204{_}18.
10136-8{_}205{_}IN OBTAINING A SERVANT'S CHARACTER, it is not well to be guided by a written one from some unknown quarter; but it is better to have an interview, if at all possible, with the former mistress.
10136-8{_}206{_}By this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place, from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house.
10136-8{_}207{_}Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household generally, will naturally lead you to the conclusion, that her servant has suffered from the influence of the bad example.
10136-8{_}208{_}The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal     interview with the lady is this:--The servant in search of the     situation must be desired to see her former mistress, and ask     her to be kind enough to appoint a time, convenient to herself,     when you may call on her; this proper observance of courtesy     being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the     part of a stranger.
10136-8{_}209{_}Your first questions should be relative to     the honesty and general morality of her former servant; and if     no objection is stated in that respect, her other qualifications     are then to be ascertained.
10136-8{_}210{_}Inquiries should be very minute, so     that you may avoid disappointment and trouble, by knowing the     weak points of your domestic.
10136-8{_}211{_}19.
10136-8{_}212{_}THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment, as well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves.
10136-8{_}213{_}On the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention; and if they perceive that the mistress's conduct is regulated by high and correct principles, they will not fail to respect her.
10136-8{_}214{_}If, also, a benevolent desire is shown to promote their comfort, at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted, then their respect will not be unmingled with affection, and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve her favour.
10136-8{_}215{_}20.
10136-8{_}216{_}IN GIVING A CHARACTER, it is scarcely necessary to say that the mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice.
10136-8{_}217{_}It is not fair for one lady to recommend to another, a servant she would not keep herself.
10136-8{_}218{_}The benefit, too, to the servant herself is of small advantage; for the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be indulged with impunity.
10136-8{_}219{_}It is hardly necessary to remark, on the other hand, that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late servant, should ever be allowed, in the slightest degree, to influence her, so far as to induce her to disparage her maid's character.
10136-8{_}220{_}21.
10136-8{_}221{_}THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE AVERAGE YEARLY WAGES paid to domestics, with the various members of the household placed in the order in which they are usually ranked, will serve as a guide to regulate the expenditure of an establishment:--                        When not found in          When found in                           Livery.

10136-8{_}224{_}Tea, Sugar, and Beer.
10136-8{_}225{_}The Housekeeper    From £20 to £15          From £18 to £40   The Lady's-maid        " 12 to 25           "  10 to 20   The Head Nurse         " 15 to 30           "  13 to 26   The Cook               " 11 to 30           "  12 to 26   The Upper Housemaid    " 12 to 20           "  10 to 17   The Upper Laundry-maid " 12 to 18           "  10 to 15   The Maid-of-all-work   " 9 to 14            "  7-1/2 to 11   The Under Housemaid    " 8 to 12            "  6-1/2 to 10   The Still-room Maid    " 9 to 14            "  8 to 13   The Nursemaid          " 8 to 12            "  5 to 10   The Under Laundry-maid " 9 to 11            "  8 to 12   The Kitchen-maid       " 9 to 14            "  8 to 12   The Scullery-maid      " 5 to 9             "  4 to 8      These quotations of wages are those usually given in or near the     metropolis; but, of course, there are many circumstances     connected with locality, and also having reference to the long     service on the one hand, or the inexperience on the other, of     domestics, which may render the wages still higher or lower than     those named above.
10136-8{_}226{_}All the domestics mentioned in the above     table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman.
10136-8{_}227{_}The number of servants, of course, would become smaller in     proportion to the lesser size of the establishment; and we may     here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes,     commencing with--    About £1,000 a year--A cook, upper housemaid, nursemaid, under                 housemaid,        and a man servant.
10136-8{_}228{_}About £750 a year--A cook, housemaid, nursemaid, and footboy.
10136-8{_}229{_}About £500 a year--A cook, housemaid, and nursemaid.
10136-8{_}230{_}About £300 a year--A maid-of-all-work and nursemaid.
10136-8{_}231{_}About £200 or £150 a year--A maid-of-all-work (and girl occasionally).
10136-8{_}232{_}22.
10136-8{_}233{_}HAVING THUS INDICATED some of the more general duties of the mistress, relative to the moral government of her household, we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world.
10136-8{_}234{_}To do this the more clearly, we will begin with her earliest duties, and take her completely through the occupations of a day.
10136-8{_}235{_}23.
10136-8{_}236{_}HAVING RISEN EARLY, as we have already advised (_see_ 3), and having given due attention to the bath, and made a careful toilet, it will be well at once to see that the children have received their proper ablutions, and are in every way clean and comfortable.
10136-8{_}237{_}The first meal of the day, breakfast, will then be served, at which all the family should be punctually present, unless illness, or other circumstances, prevent.
10136-8{_}238{_}24.
10136-8{_}239{_}AFTER BREAKFAST IS OVER, it will be well for the mistress to make a round of the kitchen and other offices, to see that all are in order, and that the morning's work has been properly performed by the various domestics.
10136-8{_}240{_}The orders for the day should then be given, and any questions which the domestics desire to ask, respecting their several departments, should be answered, and any special articles they may require, handed to them from the store-closet.
10136-8{_}241{_}In those establishments where there is a housekeeper, it will     not be so necessary for the mistress, personally, to perform the     above-named duties.
10136-8{_}242{_}25.
10136-8{_}243{_}AFTER THIS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE of her servants, the mistress, if a mother of a young family, may devote herself to the instruction of some of its younger members, or to the examination of the state of their wardrobe, leaving the later portion of the morning for reading, or for some amusing recreation.
10136-8{_}244{_}"Recreation," says Bishop Hall, "is intended to the mind as whetting is to the scythe, to sharpen the edge of it, which would otherwise grow dull and blunt.
10136-8{_}245{_}He, therefore, that spends his whole time in recreation is ever whetting, never mowing; his grass may grow and his steed starve; as, contrarily, he that always toils and never recreates, is ever mowing, never whetting, labouring much to little purpose.
10136-8{_}246{_}As good no scythe as no edge.
10136-8{_}247{_}Then only doth the work go forward, when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it may cut, and so cut, that it may have the help of sharpening."
10136-8{_}248{_}Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed, and she     be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of     her children's clothes, and other economical pursuits, it is     right that she should give some time to the pleasures of     literature, the innocent delights of the garden, and to the     improvement of any special abilities for music, painting, and     other elegant arts, which she may, happily, possess.
10136-8{_}249{_}26.
10136-8{_}250{_}THESE DUTIES AND PLEASURES BEING PERFORMED AND ENJOYED, the hour of luncheon will have arrived.
10136-8{_}251{_}This is a very necessary meal between an early breakfast and a late dinner, as a healthy person, with good exercise, should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours.
10136-8{_}252{_}It should be a light meal; but its solidity must, of course, be, in some degree, proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait for your dinner, and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time.
10136-8{_}253{_}At this time, also, the servants' dinner will be served.
10136-8{_}254{_}In those establishments where an early dinner is served, that     will, of course, take the place of the luncheon.
10136-8{_}255{_}In many houses,     where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about     one o'clock, the mistress and the elder portion of the family     make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint, or     whatever may be provided.
10136-8{_}256{_}A mistress will arrange, according to     circumstances, the serving of the meal; but the more usual plan     is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her     table, and afterwards carried to the nursery.
10136-8{_}257{_}27.
10136-8{_}258{_}AFTER LUNCHEON, MORNING CALLS AND VISITS may be made and received.
10136-8{_}259{_}These may be divided under three heads: those of ceremony, friendship, and congratulation or condolence.
10136-8{_}260{_}Visits of ceremony, or courtesy, which occasionally merge into those of friendship, are to be paid under various circumstances.
10136-8{_}261{_}Thus, they are uniformly required after dining at a friend's house, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party.
10136-8{_}262{_}These visits should be short, a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient.
10136-8{_}263{_}A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet.
10136-8{_}264{_}When other visitors are announced, it is well to retire as soon     as possible, taking care to let it appear that their arrival is     not the cause.
10136-8{_}265{_}When they are quietly seated, and the bustle of     their entrance is over, rise from your chair, taking a kind     leave of the hostess, and bowing politely to the guests.
10136-8{_}266{_}Should     you call at an inconvenient time, not having ascertained the     luncheon hour, or from any other inadvertence, retire as soon as     possible, without, however, showing that you feel yourself an     intruder.
10136-8{_}267{_}It is not difficult for any well-bred or even     good-tempered person, to know what to say on such an occasion,     and, on politely withdrawing, a promise can be made to call     again, if the lady you have called on, appear really     disappointed.
10136-8{_}268{_}28.
10136-8{_}269{_}IN PAYING VISITS OF FRIENDSHIP, it will not be so necessary to be guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony; and if a lady be pressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet, it can be done if it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements.
10136-8{_}270{_}It is, however, requisite to call at suitable times, and to avoid staying too long, if your friend is engaged.
10136-8{_}271{_}The courtesies of society should ever be maintained, even in the domestic circle, and amongst the nearest friends.
10136-8{_}272{_}During these visits, the manners should be easy and cheerful, and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated.
10136-8{_}273{_}Serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided, and there is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons and characters with whom, perhaps, there is but a slight acquaintance.
10136-8{_}274{_}(_See_ 6, 7, and 9.)
10136-8{_}275{_}It is not advisable, at any time, to take favourite dogs into     another lady's drawing-room, for many persons have an absolute     dislike to such animals; and besides this, there is always a     chance of a breakage of some article occurring, through their     leaping and bounding here and there, sometimes very much to the     fear and annoyance of the hostess.
10136-8{_}276{_}Her children, also, unless     they are particularly well-trained and orderly, and she is on     exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess, should not     accompany a lady in making morning calls.
10136-8{_}277{_}Where a lady, however,     pays her visits in a carriage, the children can be taken in the     vehicle, and remain in it until the visit is over.
10136-8{_}278{_}29.
10136-8{_}279{_}FOR MORNING CALLS, it is well to be neatly attired; for a costume very different to that you generally wear, or anything approaching an evening dress, will be very much out of place.
10136-8{_}280{_}As a general rule, it may be said, both in reference to this and all other occasions, it is better to be under-dressed than over-dressed.
10136-8{_}281{_}A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits, and notice     how soon your visits have been returned.
10136-8{_}282{_}An opinion may thus be     formed as to whether your frequent visits are, or are not,     desirable.
10136-8{_}283{_}There are, naturally, instances when the     circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return     of a call; but when this is the case, it must not interrupt the     discharge of the duty.
10136-8{_}284{_}30.
10136-8{_}285{_}IN PAYING VISITS OF CONDOLENCE, it is to be remembered that they should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them.
10136-8{_}286{_}If the acquaintance, however, is but slight, then immediately after the family has appeared at public worship.
10136-8{_}287{_}A lady should send in her card, and if her friends be able to receive her, the visitor's manner and conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her visit.
10136-8{_}288{_}Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used, and that visitors, in paying condoling visits, should be dressed in black, either silk or plain-coloured apparel.
10136-8{_}289{_}Sympathy with the affliction of the family, is thus expressed, and these attentions are, in such cases, pleasing and soothing.
10136-8{_}290{_}In all these visits, if your acquaintance or friend be not at     home, a card should be left.
10136-8{_}291{_}If in a carriage, the servant will     answer your inquiry and receive your card; if paying your visits     on foot, give your card to the servant in the hall, but leave to     go in and rest should on no account be asked.
10136-8{_}292{_}The form of words,     "Not at home," may be understood in different senses; but the     only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true.
10136-8{_}293{_}You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home,     and that she would make an exception in your favour, or you may     think that your acquaintance is not desired; but, in either     case, not the slightest word is to escape you, which would     suggest, on your part, such an impression.
10136-8{_}294{_}31.
10136-8{_}295{_}IN RECEIVING MORNING CALLS, the foregoing description of the etiquette to be observed in paying them, will be of considerable service.
10136-8{_}296{_}It is to be added, however, that the occupations of drawing, music, or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning visitors.
10136-8{_}297{_}If a lady, however, be engaged with light needlework, and none other is appropriate in the drawing-room, it may not be, under some circumstances, inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it during conversation, particularly if the visit be protracted, or the visitors be gentlemen.
10136-8{_}298{_}Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the     house to the door, and there take leave of them; but modern     society, which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of     ceremony, now merely requires that the lady of the house should     rise from her seat, shake hands, or courtesy, in accordance with     the intimacy she has with her guests, and ring the bell to     summon the servant to attend them and open the door.
10136-8{_}299{_}In making a     first call, either upon a newly-married couple, or persons newly     arrived in the neighbourhood, a lady should leave her husband's     card together with her own, at the same time, stating that the     profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him     from having the pleasure of paying the visit, with her.
10136-8{_}300{_}It is a     custom with many ladies, when on the eve of an absence from     their neighbourhood, to leave or send their own and husband's     cards, with the letters P. P. C. in the right-hand corner.
10136-8{_}301{_}These     letters are the initials of the French words, "_Pour prendre     congé_," meaning, "To take leave."
10136-8{_}302{_}32.
10136-8{_}303{_}THE MORNING CALLS BEING PAID OR RECEIVED, and their etiquette properly attended to, the next great event of the day in most establishments is "The Dinner;" and we only propose here to make a few general remarks on this important topic, as, in future pages, the whole "Art of Dining" will be thoroughly considered, with reference to its economy, comfort, and enjoyment.
10136-8{_}304{_}33.
10136-8{_}305{_}IN GIVING OR ACCEPTING AN INVITATION FOR DINNER, the following is the form of words generally made use of.
10136-8{_}306{_}They, however, can be varied in proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests:--    Mr. and Mrs. A---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. B----,   and request the honour, [or hope to have the pleasure] of their                 company   to dinner on Wednesday, the 6th of December next.
10136-8{_}307{_}A---- STREET,   _November 13th, 1859.
10136-8{_}308{_}R. S. V. P._  The letters in the corner imply "_Répondez, s'il vous plaît;_" meaning, "an answer will oblige."
10136-8{_}309{_}The reply, accepting the invitation, is couched in the following terms:--    Mr. and Mrs. B---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. A---, and   will do themselves the honour of, [or will have much pleasure in]   accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of December next.
10136-8{_}310{_}B---- SQUARE,   _November 18th, 1859._      Cards, or invitations for a dinner-party, should be issued a     fortnight or three weeks (sometimes even a month) beforehand,     and care should be taken by the hostess, in the selection of the     invited guests, that they should be suited to each other.
10136-8{_}311{_}Much     also of the pleasure of a dinner-party will depend on the     arrangement of the guests at table, so as to form a due     admixture of talkers and listeners, the grave and the gay.
10136-8{_}312{_}If an     invitation to dinner is accepted, the guests should be punctual,     and the mistress ready in her drawing-room to receive them.
10136-8{_}313{_}At     some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to     dinner, but lately _nous avons changé tout cela_.
10136-8{_}314{_}34.
10136-8{_}315{_}THE HALF-HOUR BEFORE DINNER has always been considered as the great ordeal through which the mistress, in giving a dinner-party, will either pass with flying colours, or, lose many of her laurels.
10136-8{_}316{_}The anxiety to receive her guests,--her hope that all will be present in due time,--her trust in the skill of her cook, and the attention of the other domestics, all tend to make these few minutes a trying time.
10136-8{_}317{_}The mistress, however, must display no kind of agitation, but show her tact in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation, which will be much aided by the introduction of any particular new book, curiosity of art, or article of vertu, which may pleasantly engage the attention of the company.
10136-8{_}318{_}"Waiting for Dinner," however, is a trying time, and there are few who have not felt--   "How sad it is to sit and pine,   The long _half-hour_ before we dine!
10136-8{_}319{_}Upon our watches oft to look,   Then wonder at the clock and cook,          *       *       *       *       *  "And strive to laugh in spite of Fate!
10136-8{_}320{_}But laughter forced soon quits the room,   And leaves it in its former gloom.
10136-8{_}321{_}But lo!
10136-8{_}322{_}the dinner now appears,   The object of our hopes and fears,                 The end of all our pain!"
10136-8{_}323{_}In giving an entertainment of this kind, the mistress should     remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy,     comfortable, and quite at their ease; and the guests should also     consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be     happy.
10136-8{_}324{_}Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent     enjoyment and intellectual improvement, when also acquaintances     may be formed that may prove invaluable through life, and     information gained that will enlarge the mind.
10136-8{_}325{_}Many celebrated     men and women have been great talkers; and, amongst others, the     genial Sir Walter Scott, who spoke freely to every one, and a     favourite remark of whom it was, that he never did so without     learning something he didn't know before.
10136-8{_}326{_}35.
10136-8{_}327{_}DINNER BEING ANNOUNCED, the host offers his arm to, and places on his right hand at the dinner-table, the lady to whom he desires to pay most respect, either on account of her age, position, or from her being the greatest stranger in the party.
10136-8{_}328{_}If this lady be married and her husband present, the latter takes the hostess to her place at table, and seats himself at her right hand.
10136-8{_}329{_}The rest of the company follow in couples, as specified by the master and mistress of the house, arranging the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be known to the host and hostess.
10136-8{_}330{_}It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party     at the dinner-table, to have the names of the guests neatly (and     correctly) written on small cards, and placed at that part of     the table where it is desired they should sit.
10136-8{_}331{_}With respect to     the number of guests, it has often been said, that a private     dinner-party should consist of not less than the number of the     Graces, or more than that of the Muses.
10136-8{_}332{_}A party of ten or twelve     is, perhaps, in a general way, sufficient to enjoy themselves     and be enjoyed.
10136-8{_}333{_}White kid gloves are worn by ladies at     dinner-parties, but should be taken off before the business of     dining commences.
10136-8{_}334{_}36.
10136-8{_}335{_}THE GUESTS BEING SEATED AT THE DINNER-TABLE, the lady begins to help the soup, which is handed round, commencing with the gentleman on her right and on her left, and continuing in the same order till all are served.
10136-8{_}336{_}It is generally established as a rule, not to ask for soup or fish twice, as, in so doing, part of the company may be kept waiting too long for the second course, when, perhaps, a little revenge is taken by looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion.
10136-8{_}337{_}This rule, however, may, under various circumstances, not be considered as binding.
10136-8{_}338{_}It is not usual, where taking wine is _en règle_, for a     gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is     finished, and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the     right of the hostess, may politely inquire if she will do him     the honour of taking wine with him.
10136-8{_}339{_}This will act as a signal to     the rest of the company, the gentleman of the house most     probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right     and left.
10136-8{_}340{_}At many tables, however, the custom or fashion of     drinking wine in this manner, is abolished, and the servant     fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to     the course which is in progress.
10136-8{_}341{_}37.
10136-8{_}342{_}WHEN DINNER IS FINISHED, THE DESSERT is placed on the table, accompanied with finger-glasses.
10136-8{_}343{_}It is the custom of some gentlemen to wet a corner of the napkin; but the hostess, whose behaviour will set the tone to all the ladies present, will merely wet the tips of her fingers, which will serve all the purposes required.
10136-8{_}344{_}The French and other continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth; but it is a custom which no English gentlewoman should, in the slightest degree, imitate.
10136-8{_}345{_}38.
10136-8{_}346{_}WHEN FRUIT HAS BEEN TAKEN, and a glass or two of wine passed round, the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise, and thus give the signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen, and retire to the drawing-room.
10136-8{_}347{_}The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time, and he who is nearest the door, will open it for the ladies, all remaining courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn.
10136-8{_}348{_}Dr. Johnson has a curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men.
10136-8{_}349{_}"Before dinner," he says, "men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk.
10136-8{_}350{_}When they have drunk wine, every man feels himself happy, and loses that modesty, and grows impudent and vociferous; but he is not improved, he is only not sensible of his defects."
10136-8{_}351{_}This is rather severe, but there may be truth in it.
10136-8{_}352{_}In former times, when the bottle circulated freely amongst the     guests, it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than     they do at present, for the gentlemen of the company soon became     unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential     in the presence of ladies.
10136-8{_}353{_}Thanks, however, to the improvements     in modern society, and the high example shown to the nation by     its most illustrious personages, temperance is, in these happy     days, a striking feature in the character of a gentleman.
10136-8{_}354{_}Delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with     the esteem in which they are now universally held, and thus, the     very early withdrawing of the ladies from the dining-room is to     be deprecated.
10136-8{_}355{_}A lull in the conversation will seasonably     indicate the moment for the ladies' departure.
10136-8{_}356{_}39.
10136-8{_}357{_}AFTER-DINNER INVITATIONS MAY BE GIVEN; by which we wish to be understood, invitations for the evening.
10136-8{_}358{_}The time of the arrival of these visitors will vary according to their engagements, or sometimes will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion.
10136-8{_}359{_}Guests invited for the evening are, however, generally considered at liberty to arrive whenever it will best suit themselves,--usually between nine and twelve, unless earlier hours are specifically named.
10136-8{_}360{_}By this arrangement, many fashionable people and others, who have numerous engagements to fulfil, often contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the course of one evening.
10136-8{_}361{_}40.
10136-8{_}362{_}THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DINNER-PARTY TABLE being disposed of, let us now enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball.
10136-8{_}363{_}The invitations issued and accepted for either of these, will be written in the same style as those already described for a dinner-party.
10136-8{_}364{_}They should be sent out _at least_ three weeks before the day fixed for the event, and should be replied to within a week of their receipt.
10136-8{_}365{_}By attending to these courtesies, the guests will have time to consider their engagements and prepare their dresses, and the hostess will, also, know what will be the number of her party.
10136-8{_}366{_}If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party, this must     be specified on the card or note of invitation.
10136-8{_}367{_}Short or verbal     invitations, except where persons are exceedingly intimate, or     are very near relations, are very far from proper, although, of     course, in this respect and in many other respects, very much     always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given.
10136-8{_}368{_}True politeness, however, should be studied even amongst the     nearest friends and relations; for the mechanical forms of good     breeding are of great consequence, and too much familiarity may     have, for its effect, the destruction of friendship.
10136-8{_}369{_}41.
10136-8{_}370{_}AS THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARRIVE, each should be shown to a room exclusively provided for their reception; and in that set apart for the ladies, attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking, and helping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it.
10136-8{_}371{_}It will be found convenient, in those cases where the number of guests is large, to provide numbered tickets, so that they can be attached to the cloaks and shawls of each lady, a duplicate of which should be handed to the guest.
10136-8{_}372{_}Coffee is sometimes provided in this, or an ante-room, for those who would like to partake of it.
10136-8{_}373{_}42.
10136-8{_}374{_}AS THE VISITORS ARE ANNOUNCED BY THE SERVANT, it is not necessary for the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door, but merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations.
10136-8{_}375{_}If, indeed, the hostess wishes to show particular favour to some peculiarly honoured guests, she may introduce them to others, whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and agreeable.
10136-8{_}376{_}It is very often the practice of the master of the house to introduce one gentleman to another, but occasionally the lady performs this office; when it will, of course, be polite for the persons thus introduced to take their seats together for the time being.
10136-8{_}377{_}The custom of non-introduction is very much in vogue in many     houses, and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the     position and qualities of the people around them.
10136-8{_}378{_}The servant,     indeed, calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive,     but, in many instances, mispronounces them; so that it will not     be well to follow this information, as if it were an unerring     guide.
10136-8{_}379{_}In our opinion, it is a cheerless and depressing custom,     although, in thus speaking, we do not allude to the large     assemblies of the aristocracy, but to the smaller parties of the     middle classes.
10136-8{_}380{_}43.
10136-8{_}381{_}A SEPARATE ROOM OR CONVENIENT BUFFET should be appropriated for refreshments, and to which the dancers may retire; and cakes and biscuits, with wine negus, lemonade, and ices, handed round.
10136-8{_}382{_}A supper is also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes; and this requires, on the part of the hostess, a great deal of attention and supervision.
10136-8{_}383{_}It usually takes place between the first and second parts of the programme of the dances, of which there should be several prettily written or printed copies distributed about the ball-room.
10136-8{_}384{_}_In private parties_, a lady is not to refuse the invitation of     a gentleman to dance, unless she be previously engaged.
10136-8{_}385{_}The     hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those     persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of     unblemished character, as well as pretty equal in position; and     thus, to decline the offer of any gentleman present, would be a     tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house.
10136-8{_}386{_}It may     be mentioned here, more especially for the young who will read     this book, that introductions at balls or evening parties, cease     with the occasion that calls them forth, no introduction, at     these times, giving a gentleman a right to address, afterwards,     a lady.
10136-8{_}387{_}She is, consequently, free, next morning, to pass her     partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest     recognition.
10136-8{_}388{_}44.
10136-8{_}389{_}THE BALL IS GENERALLY OPENED, that is, the first place in the first quadrille is occupied, by the lady of the house.
10136-8{_}390{_}When anything prevents this, the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is either the highest in rank, or the greatest stranger.
10136-8{_}391{_}It will be well for the hostess, even if she be very partial to the amusement, and a graceful dancer, not to participate in it to any great extent, lest her lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the gentlemen, and other causes of neglect.
10136-8{_}392{_}A few dances will suffice to show her interest in the entertainment, without unduly trenching on the attention due to her guests.
10136-8{_}393{_}In all its parts a ball should be perfect,--    "The music, and the banquet, and the wine;   The garlands, the rose-odours, and the flowers."
10136-8{_}394{_}The hostess or host, during the progress of a ball, will     courteously accost and chat with their friends, and take care     that the ladies are furnished with seats, and that those who     wish to dance are provided with partners.
10136-8{_}395{_}A gentle hint from the     hostess, conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner, that certain     ladies have remained unengaged during several dances, is sure     not to be neglected by any gentleman.
10136-8{_}396{_}Thus will be studied the     comfort and enjoyment of the guests, and no lady, in leaving the     house, will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of     not having been invited to "stand up" in a dance during the     whole of the evening.
10136-8{_}397{_}45.
10136-8{_}398{_}WHEN ANY OF THE CARRIAGES OF THE GUESTS ARE ANNOUNCED, or the time for their departure arrived, they should make a slight intimation to the hostess, without, however, exciting any observation, that they are about to depart.
10136-8{_}399{_}If this cannot be done, however, without creating too much bustle, it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without taking their leave.
10136-8{_}400{_}During the course of the week, the hostess will expect to receive from every guest a call, where it is possible, or cards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment.
10136-8{_}401{_}This attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has been at, and tends to promote social, kindly feelings.
10136-8{_}402{_}46.
10136-8{_}403{_}HAVING THUS DISCOURSED of parties of pleasure, it will be an interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house, although all the details we have been giving of dinner-parties, balls, and the like, appertain to the department of the mistress.
10136-8{_}404{_}Without a knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions, a mistress would be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings which give, as it were, a fillip to life, and make the quiet happy home of an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable.
10136-8{_}405{_}In their proper places, all that is necessary to be known respecting the dishes and appearance of the breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper tables, will be set forth in this work.
10136-8{_}406{_}47.
10136-8{_}407{_}A FAMILY DINNER AT HOME, compared with either giving or going to a dinner-party, is, of course, of much more frequent occurrence, and many will say, of much greater importance.
10136-8{_}408{_}Both, however, have to be considered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment; and the latter more particularly with reference to economy.
10136-8{_}409{_}These points will be especially noted in the following pages on "Household Cookery."
10136-8{_}410{_}Here we will only say, that for both mistress and servants, as well in large as small households, it will be found, by far, the better plan, to cook and serve the dinner, and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard, with the same cleanliness, neatness, and scrupulous exactness, whether it be for the mistress herself alone, a small family, or for "company."
10136-8{_}411{_}If this rule be strictly adhered to, all will find themselves increase in managing skill; whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become familiar, and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease, and overcome any amount of obstacles.
10136-8{_}412{_}48.
10136-8{_}413{_}OF THE MANNER OF PASSING EVENINGS AT HOME, there is none pleasanter than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from its severer duties, whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight.
10136-8{_}414{_}Where there are young people forming a part of the evening circle, interesting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted.
10136-8{_}415{_}It is of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the attractions of healthful amusement, comfort, and happiness; for if they do not find pleasure there, they will seek it elsewhere.
10136-8{_}416{_}It ought, therefore, to enter into the domestic policy of every parent, to make her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world; that to imbue them with this delicious home-feeling is one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow.
10136-8{_}417{_}Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening's     recreation for the ladies of the household, and this may be     varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon.
10136-8{_}418{_}It has     often been remarked, too, that nothing is more delightful to the     feminine members of a family, than the reading aloud of some     good standard work or amusing publication.
10136-8{_}419{_}A knowledge of polite     literature may be thus obtained by the whole family, especially     if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult     passages of the book, and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties     it may contain.
10136-8{_}420{_}This plan, in a great measure, realizes the     advice of Lord Bacon, who says, "Read not to contradict and     refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk     and discourse, but to weigh and consider."
10136-8{_}421{_}49.
10136-8{_}422{_}IN RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT, it is well to remember that early rising is almost impossible, if late going to bed be the order, or rather disorder, of the house.
10136-8{_}423{_}The younger members of a family should go early and at regular hours to their beds, and the domestics as soon as possible after a reasonably appointed hour.
10136-8{_}424{_}Either the master or the mistress of a house should, after all have gone to their separate rooms, see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below; and no servants should, on any account, be allowed to remain up after the heads of the house have retired.
10136-8{_}425{_}50.
10136-8{_}426{_}HAVING THUS GONE FROM EARLY RISING TO EARLY RETIRING, there remain only now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the mistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information.
10136-8{_}427{_}51.
10136-8{_}428{_}WHEN A MISTRESS TAKES A HOUSE in a new locality, it will be etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood call upon her; thus evincing a desire, on their part, to become acquainted with the new comer.
10136-8{_}429{_}It may be, that the mistress will desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours; but it is to be specially borne in mind that all visits, whether of ceremony, friendship, or condolence, should be punctiliously returned.
10136-8{_}430{_}52.
10136-8{_}431{_}YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED with letters of introduction from some of your friends, to persons living in the neighbourhood to which you have just come.
10136-8{_}432{_}In this case inclose the letter of introduction in an envelope with your card.
10136-8{_}433{_}Then, if the person, to whom it is addressed, calls in the course of a few days, the visit should be returned by you within the week, if possible.
10136-8{_}434{_}Any breach of etiquette, in this respect, will not readily be excused.
10136-8{_}435{_}In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above     circumstances, nothing but necessity should prevent you from     accepting the invitation.
10136-8{_}436{_}If, however, there is some distinct     reason why you cannot accept, let it be stated frankly and     plainly, for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied.
10136-8{_}437{_}An opportunity should, also, be taken to call in the course of a     day or two, in order to politely express your regret and     disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of     their kindness.
10136-8{_}438{_}53.
10136-8{_}439{_}IN GIVING A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION, it should always be handed to your friend, unsealed.
10136-8{_}440{_}Courtesy dictates this, as the person whom you are introducing would, perhaps, wish to know in what manner he or she was spoken of.
10136-8{_}441{_}Should you _receive_ a letter from a friend, introducing to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer, the letter should be immediately acknowledged, and your willingness expressed to do all in your power to carry out his or her wishes.
10136-8{_}442{_}54.
10136-8{_}443{_}SUCH ARE THE ONEROUS DUTIES which enter into the position of the mistress of a house, and such are, happily, with a slight but continued attention, of by no means difficult performance.
10136-8{_}444{_}She ought always to remember that she is the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega in the government of her establishment; and that it is by her conduct that its whole internal policy is regulated.
10136-8{_}445{_}She is, therefore, a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is.
10136-8{_}446{_}On her pattern her daughters model themselves; by her counsels they are directed; through her virtues all are honoured;--"her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband, also, and he praiseth her."
10136-8{_}447{_}Therefore, let each mistress always remember her responsible position, never approving a mean action, nor speaking an unrefined word.
10136-8{_}448{_}Let her conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her, and such as an honourable and right-minded man may look for in his wife and the mother of his children.
10136-8{_}449{_}Let her think of the many compliments and the sincere homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and writers, both in ancient and modern times.
10136-8{_}450{_}Let her not forget that she has to show herself worthy of Campbell's compliment when he said,--    "The world was sad!
10136-8{_}451{_}the garden was a wild!
10136-8{_}452{_}And man the hermit sigh'd, till _woman_ smiled."
10136-8{_}453{_}Let her prove herself, then, the happy companion of man, and able to take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate, Jeremy Taylor, who says,--"A good wife is Heaven's last best gift to man,--his angel and minister of graces innumerable,--his gem of many virtues,--his casket of jewels--her voice is sweet music--her smiles his brightest day;--her kiss, the guardian of his innocence;--her arms, the pale of his safety, the balm of his health, the balsam of his life;--her industry, his surest wealth;--her economy, his safest steward;--her lips, his faithful counsellors;--her bosom, the softest pillow of his cares; and her prayers, the ablest advocates of Heaven's blessings on his head."
10136-8{_}454{_}Cherishing, then, in her breast the respected utterances of the good and the great, let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of its management; so that, in doing her duty to all around her, she may receive the genuine reward of respect, love, and affection!
10136-8{_}455{_}_Note_.--Many mistresses have experienced the horrors of house-hunting, and it is well known that "three removes are as good (or bad, rather) as a fire."
10136-8{_}456{_}Nevertheless, it being quite evident that we must, in these days at least, live in houses, and are sometimes obliged to change our residences, it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add to, or diminish, the convenience and comfort of our homes.
10136-8{_}457{_}Although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different circumstances with different people, that to give any specific directions on this head would be impossible and useless; yet it will be advantageous, perhaps, to many, if we point out some of those general features as to locality, soil, aspect, &c., to which the attention of all house-takers should be carefully directed.
10136-8{_}458{_}Regarding the locality, we may say, speaking now more particularly of a town house, that it is very important to the health and comfort of a family, that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind, producing unwholesome effluvia or smells, should be strictly avoided.
10136-8{_}459{_}Neither is it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on, as it is unpleasant to the feelings, and tends to increase any existing irritation of the system.
10136-8{_}460{_}Referring to soils; it is held as a rule, that a gravel soil is superior to any other, as the rain drains through it very quickly, and it is consequently drier and less damp than clay, upon which water rests a far longer time.
10136-8{_}461{_}A clay country, too, is not so pleasant for walking exercise as one in which gravel predominates.
10136-8{_}462{_}The aspect of the house should be well considered, and it should be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house, the healthier is the habitation.
10136-8{_}463{_}The close, fetid smell which assails one on entering a narrow court, or street, in towns, is to be assigned to the want of light, and, consequently, air.
10136-8{_}464{_}A house with a south or south-west aspect, is lighter, warmer, drier, and consequently more healthy, than one facing the north or north-east.
10136-8{_}465{_}Great advances have been made, during the last few years, in the principles of sanitary knowledge, and one most essential point to be observed in reference to a house, is its "drainage," as it has been proved in an endless number of cases, that bad or defective drainage is as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons.
10136-8{_}466{_}This arises from its injuriously affecting the atmosphere; thus rendering the air we breathe unwholesome and deleterious.
10136-8{_}467{_}Let it be borne in mind, then, that unless a house is effectually drained, the health of its inhabitants is sure to suffer; and they will be susceptible of ague, rheumatism, diarrhoea, fevers, and cholera.
10136-8{_}468{_}We now come to an all-important point,--that of the water supply.
10136-8{_}469{_}The value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more recognized in connection with the question of health and life; and most houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water.
10136-8{_}470{_}Let it, however, be well understood, that no house, however suitable in other respects, can be desirable, if this grand means of health and comfort is, in the slightest degree, scarce or impure.
10136-8{_}471{_}No caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good, as well as plentiful; for, knowing, as we do, that not a single part of our daily food is prepared without it, the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be over-rated.
10136-8{_}472{_}Ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked.
10136-8{_}473{_}In a general way, enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows; but if this be not the case, the chimney will smoke; and other plans, such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the upper part of the window, must be used.
10136-8{_}474{_}Cold air should never be admitted under the doors, or at the bottom of a room, unless it be close to the fire or stove; for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace, and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room, unpurified, cooling, at the same time, unpleasantly and injuriously, the feet and legs of the inmates.
10136-8{_}475{_}The rent of a house, it has been said, should not exceed one-eighth of the whole income of its occupier; and, as a general rule, we are disposed to assent to this estimate, although there may be many circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible.
10136-8{_}476{_}[Illustration]     CHAPTER II.
10136-8{_}477{_}THE HOUSEKEEPER.
10136-8{_}478{_}55.
10136-8{_}479{_}AS SECOND IN COMMAND IN THE HOUSE, except in large establishments, where there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress, and bring, to the management of the household, all those qualities of honesty, industry, and vigilance, in the same degree as if she were at the head of her _own_ family.
10136-8{_}480{_}Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong-doing on the part of any of the domestics, she will overlook all that goes on in the house, and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to, and that the servants are comfortable, at the same time that their various duties are properly performed.
10136-8{_}481{_}Cleanliness, punctuality, order, and method, are essentials in     the character of a good housekeeper.
10136-8{_}482{_}Without the first, no     household can be said to be well managed.
10136-8{_}483{_}The second is equally     all-important; for those who are under the housekeeper will take     their "cue" from her; and in the same proportion as punctuality     governs her movements, so will it theirs.
10136-8{_}484{_}Order, again, is     indispensable; for by it we wish to be understood that "there     should be a place for everything, and everything in its place."
10136-8{_}485{_}Method, too, is most necessary; for when the work is properly     contrived, and each part arranged in regular succession, it will     be done more quickly and more effectually.
10136-8{_}486{_}56.
10136-8{_}487{_}A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is, that she should thoroughly understand accounts.
10136-8{_}488{_}She will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose, all the current expenses of the house, tradesmen's bills, and other extraneous matter.
10136-8{_}489{_}As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress (_see_ 16), a housekeeper's accounts should be periodically balanced, and examined by the head of the house.
10136-8{_}490{_}Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed, than this arrangement.
10136-8{_}491{_}"Short reckonings make long friends," stands good in this case, as in others.
10136-8{_}492{_}It will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every     article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping,     and is not paid for at the time.
10136-8{_}493{_}The book containing these     entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the     various tradesmen, so that any discrepancy can be inquired into     and set right.
10136-8{_}494{_}An intelligent housekeeper will, by this means,     too, be better able to judge of the average consumption of each     article by the household; and if that quantity be, at any time,     exceeded, the cause may be discovered and rectified, if it     proceed from waste or carelessness.
10136-8{_}495{_}57.
10136-8{_}496{_}ALTHOUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COOK, the housekeeper does not generally much interfere, yet it is necessary that she should possess a good knowledge of the culinary art, as, in many instances, it may be requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen.
10136-8{_}497{_}As a rule, it may be stated, that the housekeeper, in those establishments where there is no house steward or man cook, undertakes the preparation of the confectionary, attends to the preserving and pickling of fruits and vegetables; and, in a general way, to the more difficult branches of the art of cookery.
10136-8{_}498{_}Much of these arrangements will depend, however, on the     qualifications of the cook; for instance, if she be an able     artiste, there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper     to interfere, except in the already noticed articles of     confectionary, &c. On the contrary, if the cook be not so clever     an adept in her art, then it will be requisite for the     housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the     kitchen, than in the former case.
10136-8{_}499{_}It will be one of the duties     of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing, in the absence of     either a house steward or man cook.
10136-8{_}500{_}58.
10136-8{_}501{_}THE DAILY DUTIES OF A HOUSEKEEPER are regulated, in a great measure, by the extent of the establishment she superintends.
10136-8{_}502{_}She should, however, rise early, and see that all the domestics are duly performing their work, and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the preparation of the breakfast for the household and family.
10136-8{_}503{_}After breakfast, which, in large establishments, she will take in the "housekeeper's room" with the lady's-maid, butler, and valet, and where they will be waited on by the still-room maid, she will, on various days set apart for each purpose, carefully examine the household linen, with a view to its being repaired, or to a further quantity being put in hand to be made; she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is well rubbed and polished; and will, besides, attend to all the necessary details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen.
10136-8{_}504{_}The housekeeper's room is generally made use of by the     lady's-maid, butler, and valet, who take there their breakfast,     tea, and supper.
10136-8{_}505{_}The lady's-maid will also use this apartment as     a sitting-room, when not engaged with her lady, or with some     other duties, which would call her elsewhere.
10136-8{_}506{_}In different     establishments, according to their size and the rank of the     family, different rules of course prevail.
10136-8{_}507{_}For instance, in the     mansions of those of very high rank, and where there is a house     steward, there are two distinct tables kept, one in the     steward's room for the principal members of the household, the     other in the servants' hall, for the other domestics.
10136-8{_}508{_}At the     steward's dinner-table, the steward and housekeeper preside; and     here, also, are present the lady's-maid, butler, valet, and head     gardener.
10136-8{_}509{_}Should any visitors be staying with the family, their     servants, generally the valet and lady's-maid, will be admitted     to the steward's table.
10136-8{_}510{_}59.
10136-8{_}511{_}AFTER DINNER, the housekeeper, having seen that all the members of the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties, and that all the departments of the household are in proper working order, will have many important matters claiming her attention.
10136-8{_}512{_}She will, possibly, have to give the finishing touch to some article of confectionary, or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes of the still-room.
10136-8{_}513{_}There may also be the dessert to arrange, ice-creams to make; and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care, taste, and attention.
10136-8{_}514{_}The still-room was formerly much more in vogue than at present;     for in days of "auld lang syne," the still was in constant     requisition for the supply of sweet-flavoured waters for the     purposes of cookery, scents and aromatic substances used in the     preparation of the toilet, and cordials in cases of accidents     and illness.
10136-8{_}515{_}There are some establishments, however, in which     distillation is still carried on, and in these, the still-room     maid has her old duties to perform.
10136-8{_}516{_}In a general way, however,     this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper.
10136-8{_}517{_}For     the latter she lights the fire, dusts her room, prepares the     breakfast-table, and waits at the different meals taken in the     housekeeper's room (_see_ 58).
10136-8{_}518{_}A still-room maid may learn a     very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection     with the housekeeper, and if she be active and intelligent, may     soon fit herself for a better position in the household.
10136-8{_}519{_}60.
10136-8{_}520{_}IN THE EVENING, the housekeeper will often busy herself with the necessary preparations for the next day's duties.
10136-8{_}521{_}Numberless small, but still important arrangements, will have to be made, so that everything may move smoothly.
10136-8{_}522{_}At times, perhaps, attention will have to be paid to the breaking of lump-sugar, the stoning of raisins, the washing, cleansing, and drying of currants, &c. The evening, too, is the best time for setting right her account of the expenditure, and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid, and also for making memoranda of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments.
10136-8{_}523{_}Periodically, at some convenient time,--for instance, quarterly     or half-yearly, it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an     inventory of everything she has under her care, and compare this     with the lists of a former period; she will then be able to     furnish a statement, if necessary, of the articles which, on     account of time, breakage, loss, or other causes, it has been     necessary to replace or replenish.
10136-8{_}524{_}61.
10136-8{_}525{_}IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS on the duties of the housekeeper, we will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to her position.
10136-8{_}526{_}Like "Caesar's wife," she should be "above suspicion," and her honesty and sobriety unquestionable; for there are many temptations to which she is exposed.
10136-8{_}527{_}In a physical point of view, a housekeeper should be healthy and strong, and be particularly clean in her person, and her hands, although they may show a degree of roughness, from the nature of some of her employments, yet should have a nice inviting appearance.
10136-8{_}528{_}In her dealings with the various tradesmen, and in her behaviour to the domestics under her, the demeanour and conduct of the housekeeper should be such as, in neither case, to diminish, by an undue familiarity, her authority or influence.
10136-8{_}529{_}_Note_.--It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the best seasons for various occupations connected with Household Management; and we, accordingly, subjoin a few hints which we think will prove valuable.
10136-8{_}530{_}As, in the winter months, servants have much more to do, in consequence of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout the household, not much more than the ordinary every-day work can be attempted.
10136-8{_}531{_}In the summer, and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more leisure, then any extra work that is required, can be more easily performed.
10136-8{_}532{_}The spring is the usual period set apart for house-cleaning, and removing all the dust and dirt, which will necessarily, with the best of housewives, accumulate during the winter months, from the smoke of the coal, oil, gas, &c. This season is also well adapted for washing and bleaching linen, &c., as, the weather, not being then too hot for the exertions necessary in washing counterpanes, blankets, and heavy things in general, the work is better and more easily done than in the intense heats of July, which month some recommend for these purposes.
10136-8{_}533{_}Winter curtains should be taken down, and replaced by the summer white ones; and furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by.
10136-8{_}534{_}The former should be well shaken and brushed, and then pinned upon paper or linen, with camphor to preserve them from the moths.
10136-8{_}535{_}Furs, &c., will be preserved in the same way.
10136-8{_}536{_}Included, under the general description of house-cleaning, must be understood, turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers, cupboards, lumber-rooms, lofts, &c., with a view of getting rid of all unnecessary articles, which only create dirt and attract vermin; sweeping of chimneys, taking up carpets, painting and whitewashing the kitchen and offices, papering rooms, when needed, and, generally speaking, the house putting on, with the approaching summer, a bright appearance, and a new face, in unison with nature.
10136-8{_}537{_}Oranges now should be preserved, and orange wine made.
10136-8{_}538{_}The summer will be found, as we have mentioned above, in consequence of the diminution of labour for the domestics, the best period for examining and repairing household linen, and for "putting to rights" all those articles which have received a large share of wear and tear during the dark winter days.
10136-8{_}539{_}In direct reference to this matter, we may here remark, that sheets should be turned "sides to middle" before they are allowed to get very thin.
10136-8{_}540{_}Otherwise, patching, which is uneconomical from the time it consumes, and is unsightly in point of appearance, will have to be resorted to.
10136-8{_}541{_}In June and July, gooseberries, currants, raspberries, strawberries, and other summer fruits, should be preserved, and jams and jellies made.
10136-8{_}542{_}In July, too, the making of walnut ketchup should be attended to, as the green walnuts will be approaching perfection for this purpose.
10136-8{_}543{_}Mixed pickles may also be now made, and it will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle-juice (for the making of which all information will be given in future pages), into which to put occasionally some young French beans, cauliflowers, &c.  In the early autumn, plums of various kinds are to be bottled and preserved, and jams and jellies made.
10136-8{_}544{_}A little later, tomato sauce, a most useful article to have by you, may be prepared; a supply of apples laid in, if you have a place to keep them, as also a few keeping pears and filberts.
10136-8{_}545{_}Endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow,--it will be found delicious in the winter.
10136-8{_}546{_}In October and November, it will be necessary to prepare for the cold weather, and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of the family.
10136-8{_}547{_}The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away, the fireplaces, grates, and chimneys looked to, and the House put in a thorough state of repair, so that no "loose tile" may, at a future day, interfere with your comfort, and extract something considerable from your pocket.
10136-8{_}548{_}In December, the principal household duty lies in preparing for the creature comforts of those near and dear to us, so as to meet old Christmas with a happy face, a contented mind, and a full larder; and in stoning the plums, washing the currants, cutting the citron, beating the eggs, and MIXING THE PUDDING, a housewife is not unworthily greeting the genial season of all good things.
10136-8{_}549{_}[Illustration]     CHAPTER III.
10136-8{_}550{_}ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN.
10136-8{_}551{_}62.
10136-8{_}552{_}"THE DISTRIBUTION OF A KITCHEN," says Count Rumford, the celebrated philosopher and physician, who wrote so learnedly on all subjects connected with domestic economy and architecture, "must always depend so much on local circumstances, that general rules can hardly be given respecting it; the principles, however, on which this distribution ought, in all cases, to be made, are simple and easy to be understood," and, in his estimation, these resolve themselves into symmetry of proportion in the building and convenience to the cook.
10136-8{_}553{_}The requisites of a good kitchen, however, demand something more special than is here pointed out.
10136-8{_}554{_}It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of every household, and that much of the "weal or woe," as far as regards bodily health, depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted within its walls.
10136-8{_}555{_}A good kitchen, therefore, should be erected with a view to the following particulars.
10136-8{_}556{_}1.
10136-8{_}557{_}Convenience of distribution in its parts, with largeness of dimension.
10136-8{_}558{_}2.
10136-8{_}559{_}Excellence of light, height of ceiling, and good ventilation.
10136-8{_}560{_}3.
10136-8{_}561{_}Easiness of access, without passing through the house.
10136-8{_}562{_}4.
10136-8{_}563{_}Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments of the house, that the members, visitors, or guests of the family, may not perceive the odour incident to cooking, or hear the noise of culinary operations.
10136-8{_}564{_}5.
10136-8{_}565{_}Plenty of fuel and water, which, with the scullery, pantry, and storeroom, should be so near it, as to offer the smallest possible trouble in reaching them.
10136-8{_}566{_}[Illustration: _Fig_.
10136-8{_}567{_}1.]
10136-8{_}568{_}The kitchens of the Middle Ages, in England, are said to have     been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans.
10136-8{_}569{_}They     were generally octagonal, with several fireplaces, but no     chimneys; neither was there any wood admitted into the building.
10136-8{_}570{_}The accompanying cut, fig.
10136-8{_}571{_}1, represents the turret which was     erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at     Glastonbury Abbey, and which was perforated with holes to allow     the smoke of the fire, as well as the steam from cooking, to     escape.
10136-8{_}572{_}Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to     let out the steam, which was sometimes considerable, as the     Anglo-Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state.
10136-8{_}573{_}From     this circumstance, some of their large kitchens had four ranges,     comprising a boiling-place for small boiled meats, and a     boiling-house for the great boiler.
10136-8{_}574{_}In private houses the     culinary arrangements were no doubt different; for Du Cange     mentions a little kitchen with a chamber, even in a solarium, or     upper floor.
10136-8{_}575{_}63.
10136-8{_}576{_}THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES has frequently been an object of poetical admiration, and it delights the imagination to picture men living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth, and desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst, but such as fountains and rivers supply.
10136-8{_}577{_}Thus we are told, that the ancient inhabitants of Argos lived principally on pears; that the Arcadians revelled in acorns, and the Athenians in figs.
10136-8{_}578{_}This, of course, was in the golden age, before ploughing began, and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread "by the sweat of their brow."
10136-8{_}579{_}This delightful period, however, could not last for ever, and the earth became barren, and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the art of sowing, with several other useful inventions.
10136-8{_}580{_}The first whom she taught to till the ground was Triptolemus, who communicated his instructions to his countrymen the Athenians.
10136-8{_}581{_}Thence the art was carried into Achaia, and thence into Arcadia.
10136-8{_}582{_}Barley was the first grain that was used, and the invention of bread-making is ascribed to Pan.
10136-8{_}583{_}The use of fire, as an instrument of cookery, must have been     coeval with this invention of bread, which, being the most     necessary of all kinds of food, was frequently used in a sense     so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink.
10136-8{_}584{_}It was, by     the Greeks, baked under the ashes.
10136-8{_}585{_}64.
10136-8{_}586{_}IN THE PRIMARY AGES it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh, and when mankind began to depart from their primitive habits, the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten.
10136-8{_}587{_}For several ages, it was pronounced unlawful to slaughter oxen, from an estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the ground; nor was it usual to kill young animals, from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence.
10136-8{_}588{_}At this period no cooks were kept, and we know from Homer that     his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with     their own hands.
10136-8{_}589{_}Ulysses, for example, we are told, like a     modern charwoman, excelled at lighting a fire, whilst Achilles     was an adept at turning a spit.
10136-8{_}590{_}Subsequently, heralds, employed     in civil and military affairs, filled the office of cooks, and     managed marriage feasts; but this, no doubt, was after mankind     had advanced in the art of living, a step further than     _roasting_, which, in all places, was the ancient manner of     dressing meat.
10136-8{_}591{_}65.
10136-8{_}592{_}THE AGE OF ROASTING we may consider as that in which the use of the metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art; and amongst these, iron, the most useful of them all, would necessarily take a prominent place.
10136-8{_}593{_}This metal is easily oxidized, but to bring it to a state of fusibility, it requires a most intense heat.
10136-8{_}594{_}Of all the metals, it is the widest diffused and most abundant; and few stones or mineral bodies are without an admixture of it.
10136-8{_}595{_}It possesses the valuable property of being welded by hammering; and hence its adaptation to the numerous purposes of civilized life.
10136-8{_}596{_}Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries, and a     twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to     consist of this metal.
10136-8{_}597{_}Blood owes its colour of redness to the     quantity of iron it contains, and rain and snow are seldom     perfectly free from it.
10136-8{_}598{_}In the arts it is employed in three     states,--as _cast_ iron, _wrought_ iron, and _steel_.
10136-8{_}599{_}In each of     these it largely enters into the domestic economy, and stoves,     grates, and the general implements of cookery, are usually     composed of it.
10136-8{_}600{_}In antiquity, its employment was, comparatively     speaking, equally universal.
10136-8{_}601{_}The excavations made at Pompeii     have proved this.
10136-8{_}602{_}The accompanying cuts present us with     specimens of stoves, both ancient and modern.
10136-8{_}603{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}604{_}2 is the     remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa, at     Pompeii, and would seem, in its perfect state, not to have been     materially different from such as are in use at the present day.

10136-8{_}616{_}4, is called the Improved Leamington Kitchener,     and is said to surpass any other range in use, for easy cooking     by one fire.
10136-8{_}617{_}It has a hot plate, which is well calculated for an     ironing-stove, and on which as many vessels as will stand upon     it, may be kept boiling, without being either soiled or injured.
10136-8{_}618{_}Besides, it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought-iron     roaster, with movable shelves, draw-out stand, double     dripping-pan, and meat-stand.
10136-8{_}619{_}The roaster can be converted into     an oven by closing the valves, when bread and pastry can be     baked in it in a superior manner.
10136-8{_}620{_}It also has a large iron     boiler with brass tap and steam-pipe, round and square gridirons     for chops and steaks, ash-pan, open fire for roasting, and a set     of ornamental covings with plate-warmer attached.
10136-8{_}621{_}It took a     first-class prize and medal in the Great Exhibition of 1851, and     was also exhibited, with all the recent improvements, at the     Dublin Exhibition in 1853.

10136-8{_}623{_}5 is another kitchener, adapted     for large families.
10136-8{_}624{_}It has on the one side, a large ventilated     oven; and on the other, the fire and roaster.
10136-8{_}625{_}The hot plate is     over all, and there is a back boiler, made of wrought iron, with     brass tap and steam-pipe.
10136-8{_}626{_}In other respects it resembles Fig.

10136-8{_}642{_}FROM KITCHEN RANGES to the implements used in cookery is but a step.
10136-8{_}643{_}With these, every kitchen should be well supplied, otherwise the cook must not be expected to "perform her office" in a satisfactory manner.
10136-8{_}644{_}Of the culinary utensils of the ancients, our knowledge is very limited; but as the art of living, in every civilized country, is pretty much the same, the instruments for cooking must, in a great degree, bear a striking resemblance to each other.
10136-8{_}645{_}On referring to classical antiquities, we find mentioned, among household utensils, leather bags, baskets constructed of twigs, reeds, and rushes; boxes, basins, and bellows; bread-moulds, brooms, and brushes; caldrons, colanders, cisterns, and chafing-dishes; cheese-rasps, knives, and ovens of the Dutch kind; funnels and frying-pans; handmills, soup-ladles, milk-pails, and oil-jars; presses, scales, and sieves; spits of different sizes, but some of them large enough to roast an ox; spoons, fire-tongs, trays, trenchers, and drinking-vessels; with others for carrying food, preserving milk, and holding cheese.
10136-8{_}646{_}This enumeration, if it does nothing else, will, to some extent, indicate the state of the simpler kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients.

10136-8{_}653{_}In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the     kitchen utensils enumerated above, they bore a great resemblance     to our own.
10136-8{_}654{_}This will be seen by the accompanying cuts.
10136-8{_}655{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}656{_}6     is an ancient stock-pot in bronze, which seems to have been made     to hang over the fire, and was found in the buried city of     Pompeii.
10136-8{_}657{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}658{_}7 is one of modern make, and may be obtained     either of copper or wrought iron, tinned inside.
10136-8{_}659{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}660{_}8 is     another of antiquity, with a large ladle and colander, with     holes attached.
10136-8{_}661{_}It is taken from the column of Trajan.
10136-8{_}662{_}The     modern ones can be obtained at all prices, according to size,     from 13s.

10136-8{_}667{_}IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE UTENSILS, bronze metal seems to have been much in favour with the ancients.
10136-8{_}668{_}It was chosen not only for their domestic vessels, but it was also much used for their public sculptures and medals.
10136-8{_}669{_}It is a compound, composed of from six to twelve parts of tin to one hundred of copper.
10136-8{_}670{_}It gives its name to figures and all pieces of sculpture made of it.
10136-8{_}671{_}Brass was another favourite metal, which is composed of copper and zinc.
10136-8{_}672{_}It is more fusible than copper, and not so apt to tarnish.
10136-8{_}673{_}In a pure state it is not malleable, unless when hot, and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer.
10136-8{_}674{_}To render it capable of being wrought, it requires 7 lb.
10136-8{_}675{_}of lead to be put to 1 cwt.
10136-8{_}676{_}of its own material.
10136-8{_}677{_}The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver, gold,     and copper.
10136-8{_}678{_}A fine kind of brass, supposed to be made by the     cementation of copper plates with calamine, is, in Germany,     hammered out into leaves, and is called Dutch metal in this     country.
10136-8{_}679{_}It is employed in the same way as gold leaf.
10136-8{_}680{_}Brass is     much used for watchworks, as well as for wire.
10136-8{_}681{_}68.
10136-8{_}682{_}The braziers, ladles, stewpans, saucepans, gridirons, and colanders of antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture of the present day, in so far as shape is concerned.
10136-8{_}683{_}In proof of this we have placed together the following similar articles of ancient and modern pattern, in order that the reader may, at a single view, see wherein any difference that is between them, consists.

10136-8{_}715{_}9 and 10 are flat sauce or _sauté_ pans, the ancient one     being fluted in the handle, and having at the end a ram's head.
10136-8{_}716{_}Figs.
10136-8{_}717{_}11 and 12 are colanders, the handle of the ancient one     being adorned, in the original, with carved representations of a     cornucopia, a satyr, a goat, pigs, and other animals.
10136-8{_}718{_}Any     display of taste in the adornment of such utensils, might seem     to be useless; but when we remember how much more natural it is     for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly, than of     the plain and cheap, it may even become a question in the     economy of a kitchen, whether it would not, in the long run, be     cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity     in their manufacture, than such as are so perfectly plain as to     have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to     the purposes for which they are made.
10136-8{_}719{_}Figs.
10136-8{_}720{_}13 and 14 are     saucepans, the ancient one being of bronze, originally copied     from the cabinet of M. l'Abbé Charlet, and engraved in the     Antiquities of Montfaucon.
10136-8{_}721{_}Figs.
10136-8{_}722{_}15 and 17 are gridirons, and 16     and 18 dripping-pans.
10136-8{_}723{_}In all these utensils the resemblance     between such as were in use 2,000 years ago, and those in use at     the present day, is strikingly manifest.
10136-8{_}724{_}69.
10136-8{_}725{_}SOME OF THE ANCIENT UTENSILS represented in the above cuts, are copied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii.
10136-8{_}726{_}These Roman cities were, in the first century, buried beneath the lava of an eruption of Vesuvius, and continued to be lost to the world till the beginning of the last century, when a peasant, in digging for a well, gradually discovered a small temple with some statues.
10136-8{_}727{_}Little notice, however, was taken of this circumstance till 1736, when the king of Naples, desiring to erect a palace at Portici, caused extensive excavations to be made, when the city of Herculaneum was slowly unfolded to view.
10136-8{_}728{_}Pompeii was discovered about 1750, and being easier cleared from the lava in which it had so long been entombed, disclosed itself as it existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it, nearly two thousand years ago.
10136-8{_}729{_}It presented, to the modern world, the perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city.
10136-8{_}730{_}The interior of its habitations, shops, baths, theatres, and temples, were all disclosed, with many of the implements used by the workmen in their various trades, and the materials on which they were employed, when the doomed city was covered with the lavian stream.
10136-8{_}731{_}70.
10136-8{_}732{_}AMONGST THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS of the kitchen are scales or weighing-machines for family use.
10136-8{_}733{_}These are found to have existed among the ancients, and must, at a very early age, have been both publicly and privately employed for the regulation of quantities.
10136-8{_}734{_}The modern English weights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of Magna Charta, or the great charter forced, by the barons, from King John at Runnymede, in Surrey.
10136-8{_}735{_}Therein it is declared that the weights, all over England, shall be the same, although for different commodities there were two different kinds, Troy and Avoirdupois.
10136-8{_}736{_}The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat gathered in the middle of an ear.
10136-8{_}737{_}The standard of measures was originally kept at Winchester, and by a law of King Edgar was ordained to be observed throughout the kingdom.

10136-8{_}740{_}[Illustration: _Fig_.

10136-8{_}742{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}743{_}19 is an ancient pair of common scales, with two basins and     a movable weight, which is made in the form of a head, covered     with the pileus, because Mercury had the weights and measures     under his superintendence.
10136-8{_}744{_}It is engraved on a stone in the     gallery of Florence.
10136-8{_}745{_}Fig.
10136-8{_}746{_}20 represents a modern     weighing-machine, of great convenience, and generally in use in     those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried     on.
10136-8{_}747{_}71.
10136-8{_}748{_}ACCOMPANYING THE SCALES, or weighing-machines, there should be spice-boxes, and sugar and biscuit-canisters of either white or japanned tin.
10136-8{_}749{_}The covers of these should fit tightly, in order to exclude the air, and if necessary, be lettered in front, to distinguish them.
10136-8{_}750{_}The white metal of which they are usually composed, loses its colour when exposed to the air, but undergoes no further change.
10136-8{_}751{_}It enters largely into the composition of culinary utensils, many of them being entirely composed of tinned sheet-iron; the inside of copper and iron vessels also, being usually what is called _tinned_.
10136-8{_}752{_}This art consists of covering any metal with a thin coating of tin; and it requires the metal to be covered, to be perfectly clean and free from rust, and also that the tin, itself, be purely metallic, and entirely cleared from all ashes or refuse.
10136-8{_}753{_}Copper boilers, saucepans, and other kitchen utensils, are tinned after they are manufactured, by being first made hot and the tin rubbed on with resin.
10136-8{_}754{_}In this process, nothing ought to be used but pure grain-tin.
10136-8{_}755{_}Lead, however, is sometimes mixed with that metal, not only to make it lie more easily, but to adulterate it--a pernicious practice, which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of food, cannot be too severely reprobated.--The following list, supplied by Messrs. Richard & John Slack, 336, Strand, will show the articles required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life, although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary for some families, and may contain more than are required for others.
10136-8{_}756{_}As Messrs.
10136-8{_}757{_}Slack themselves, however, publish a useful illustrated catalogue, which may be had at their establishment _gratis_, and which it will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish, it supersedes the necessity of our enlarging that which we give:--                                   s.  d.    1 Tea-kettle                   6   6   1 Toasting-fork                1   0   1 Bread-grater                 1   0   1 Pair of Brass Candlesticks   3   6   1 Teapot and Tray              6   6   1 Bottle-jack                  9   6   6 Spoons                       1   6   2 Candlesticks                 2   6   1 Candle-box                   1   4   6 Knives and Forks             5   3   2 Sets of Skewers              1   0   1 Meat-chopper                 1   9   1 Cinder-sifter                1   3   1 Coffee-pot                   2   3   1 Colander                     1   6   3 Block-tin Saucepans          5   9   5 Iron Saucepans              12   0   1 Ditto and Steamer            6   6   1 Large Boiling-pot           10   0   4 Iron Stewpans                8   9   1 Dripping-pan and Stand       6   6   1 Dustpan                      1   0   1 Fish and Egg-slice           1   9   2 Fish-kettles                10   0   1 Flour-box                    1   0   3 Flat-irons                   3   6   2 Frying-pans                  4   0   1 Gridiron                     2   0   1 Mustard-pot                  1   0   1 Salt-cellar                  0   8   1 Pepper-box                   0   6   1 Pair of Bellows              2   0   3 Jelly-moulds                 8   0   1 Plate-basket                 5   6   1 Cheese-toaster               1  10   1 Coal-shovel                  2   6   1 Wood Meat-screen            30   0    The Set                  £8   11   1   72.
10136-8{_}758{_}AS NOT ONLY HEALTH BUT LIFE may be said to depend on the cleanliness of culinary utensils, great attention must be paid to their condition generally, but more especially to that of the saucepans, stewpans, and boilers.
10136-8{_}759{_}Inside they should be kept perfectly clean, and where an open fire is used, the outside as clean as possible.
10136-8{_}760{_}With a Leamington range, saucepans, stewpans, &c., can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot on the outside, which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or scullery-maid.
10136-8{_}761{_}Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close, so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation.
10136-8{_}762{_}They should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out, and should always be bright on the upper rim, where they do not immediately come in contact with the fire.
10136-8{_}763{_}Soup-pots and kettles should be washed immediately After being used, and dried before the fire, and they should be kept in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust, and, thereby, be destroyed.
10136-8{_}764{_}Copper utensils should never be used in the kitchen unless tinned, and the utmost care should be taken, not to let the tin be rubbed off.
10136-8{_}765{_}If by chance this should occur, have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use.
10136-8{_}766{_}Neither soup nor gravy should, at any time, be suffered to remain in them longer than is absolutely necessary, as any fat or acid that is in them, may affect the metal, so as to impregnate with poison what is intended to be eaten.
10136-8{_}767{_}Stone and earthenware vessels should be provided for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use, and, also, plenty of common dishes for the larder, that the table-set may not be used for such purposes.
10136-8{_}768{_}It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour, when they are apt to corrode glazed red-ware, and even metals, and frequently, thereby, to become impregnated with poisonous particles.
10136-8{_}769{_}The vinegar also in pickles, by its acidity, does the same.
10136-8{_}770{_}Consideration, therefore, should be given to these facts, and great care also taken that all _sieves, jelly-bags,_ and tapes for collared articles, be well scalded and kept dry, or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when next used.
10136-8{_}771{_}To all these directions the cook should pay great attention, nor should they, by any means, be neglected by the _mistress of the household_, who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives health and happiness to home, whilst economy will immeasurably assist in preserving them.
10136-8{_}772{_}73.
10136-8{_}773{_}WITHOUT FUEL, A KITCHEN might be pronounced to be of little use; therefore, to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the means of domestic heat and comfort, has exercised the ingenuity of man.
10136-8{_}774{_}Those now known have been divided into five classes; the first comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies; the second, peat or turf; the third, charcoal of wood; the fourth, pit-coal charred; and the fifth, wood or pit-coal in a crude state, with the capacity of yielding a copious and bright flame.
10136-8{_}775{_}The first may be said seldom to be employed for the purposes of cookery; but _peat_, especially amongst rural populations, has, in all ages, been regarded as an excellent fuel.
10136-8{_}776{_}It is one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil, and belongs to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom.
10136-8{_}777{_}It may be described as composed of wet, spongy black earth, held together by decayed vegetables.
10136-8{_}778{_}Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England, but has greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement.
10136-8{_}779{_}_Charcoal_ is a kind of artificial coal, used principally where a strong and clear fire is desired.
10136-8{_}780{_}It is a black, brittle, insoluble, inodorous, tasteless substance, and, when newly-made, possesses the remarkable property of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases.
10136-8{_}781{_}Its dust, when used as a polishing powder, gives great brilliancy to metals.
10136-8{_}782{_}It consists of wood half-burned, and is manufactured by cutting pieces of timber into nearly the same size, then disposing them in heaps, and covering them with earth, so as to prevent communication with the air, except when necessary to make them burn.
10136-8{_}783{_}When they have been sufficiently charred, the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents through which the air is admitted.
10136-8{_}784{_}Of _coal_ there are various species; as, pit, culm, slate, cannel, Kilkenny, sulphurous, bovey, jet, &c. These have all their specific differences, and are employed for various purposes; but are all, more or less, used as fuel.
10136-8{_}785{_}The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the     Romans.
10136-8{_}786{_}In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before     the birth of Christ, in Lancashire, not tar from where     Manchester now stands; but for ages after its discovery, so long     as forests abounded, wood continued to be the fuel used for     firing.
10136-8{_}787{_}The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry     III., who, in 1272, granted a charter to the town of Newcastle,     permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal.
10136-8{_}788{_}It took some     centuries more, however, to bring it into common use, as this     did not take place till about the first quarter of the     seventeenth century, in the time of Charles I.
10136-8{_}789{_}A few years after     the Restoration, we find that about 200,000 chaldrons were     consumed in London.
10136-8{_}790{_}Although several countries possess mines of     coal, the quality of their mineral is, in general, greatly     inferior to that of Great Britain, where it is found mostly in     undulating districts abounding with valleys, and interspersed     with plains of considerable extent.
10136-8{_}791{_}It lies usually between the     _strata_ of other substances, and rarely in an horizontal     position, but with a _dip_ or inclination to one side.
10136-8{_}792{_}Our cut,     Fig.
10136-8{_}793{_}21, represents a section of coal as it is found in the     stratum.

10136-8{_}880{_}75.
10136-8{_}881{_}WHEN FUEL AND FOOD ARE PROCURED, the next consideration is, how the latter may be best preserved, with a view to its being suitably dressed.
10136-8{_}882{_}More waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment, or of necessary care in this particular, than by any other cause.
10136-8{_}883{_}In the absence of proper places for keeping provisions, a hanging safe, suspended in an airy situation, is the best substitute.
10136-8{_}884{_}A well-ventilated larder, dry and shady, is better for meat and poultry, which require to be kept for some time; and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate for the want of proper attention to this particular.
10136-8{_}885{_}Though it is advisable that annual food should be hung up in the open air till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness, yet, if it is kept till it loses its natural sweetness, its flavour has become deteriorated, and, as a wholesome comestible, it has lost many of its qualities conducive to health.
10136-8{_}886{_}As soon, therefore, as the slightest trace of putrescence is detected, it has reached its highest degree of tenderness, and should be dressed immediately.
10136-8{_}887{_}During the sultry summer months, it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or tainted.
10136-8{_}888{_}It should, therefore, be well examined when it comes in, and if flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and the remainder well washed.
10136-8{_}889{_}In very cold weather, meat and vegetables touched by the frost, should be brought into the kitchen early in the morning, and soaked in cold water.
10136-8{_}890{_}In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef.
10136-8{_}891{_}Rumps and edgebones of beef, when bruised, should not be purchased.
10136-8{_}892{_}All these things ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager, and great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away, or suffered to be wasted in the kitchen, which might, by proper management, be turned to a good account.
10136-8{_}893{_}The shank-bones of mutton, so little esteemed in general, give richness to soups or gravies, if well soaked and brushed before they are added to the boiling.
10136-8{_}894{_}They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons.
10136-8{_}895{_}Roast-beef bones, or shank-bones of ham, make excellent stock for pea-soup.--When the whites of eggs are used for jelly, confectionary, or other purposes, a pudding or a custard should be made, that the yolks may be used.
10136-8{_}896{_}All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness: sugars of different sorts; currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked, or in canisters, as we have already directed (72).
10136-8{_}897{_}Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month.
10136-8{_}898{_}Much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it.
10136-8{_}899{_}Vegetables keep best on a stone floor, if the air be excluded; meat, in a cold dry place; as also salt, sugar, sweet-meats, candles, dried meats, and hams.
10136-8{_}900{_}Rice, and all sorts of seed for puddings, should be closely covered to preserve them from insects; but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers, if they are long and carelessly kept.
10136-8{_}901{_}[Illustration]     CHAPTER IV.
10136-8{_}902{_}INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY.
10136-8{_}903{_}76.
10136-8{_}904{_}AS IN THE FINE ARTS, the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude materialities of nature, so in the art of cookery is the progress gradual from the earliest and simplest modes, to those of the most complicated and refined.
10136-8{_}905{_}Plain or rudely-carved stones, tumuli, or mounds of earth, are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the events of their history, to be succeeded, only in the long course of a series of ages, by beautifully-proportioned columns, gracefully-sculptured statues, triumphal arches, coins, medals, and the higher efforts of the pencil and the pen, as man advances by culture and observation to the perfection of his facilities.
10136-8{_}906{_}So is it with the art of cookery.
10136-8{_}907{_}Man, in his primitive state, lives upon roots and the fruits of the earth, until, by degrees, he is driven to seek for new means, by which his wants may be supplied and enlarged.
10136-8{_}908{_}He then becomes a hunter and a fisher.
10136-8{_}909{_}As his species increases, greater necessities come upon him, when he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more stationary pursuits of the herdsman.
10136-8{_}910{_}These beget still more settled habits, when he begins the practice of agriculture, forms ideas of the rights of property, and has his own, both defined and secured.
10136-8{_}911{_}The forest, the stream, and the sea are now no longer his only resources for food.
10136-8{_}912{_}He sows and he reaps, pastures and breeds cattle, lives on the cultivated produce of his fields, and revels in the luxuries of the dairy; raises flocks for clothing, and assumes, to all intents and purposes, the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of a farmer.
10136-8{_}913{_}This is the fourth stage of social progress, up to which the useful or mechanical arts have been incidentally developing themselves, when trade and commerce begin.
10136-8{_}914{_}Through these various phases, _only to live_ has been the great object of mankind; but, by-and-by, comforts are multiplied, and accumulating riches create new wants.
10136-8{_}915{_}The object, then, is not only to _live_, but to live economically, agreeably, tastefully, and well.
10136-8{_}916{_}Accordingly, the art of cookery commences; and although the fruits of the earth, the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, and the fish of the sea, are still the only food of mankind, yet these are so prepared, improved, and dressed by skill and ingenuity, that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments.
10136-8{_}917{_}Everything that is edible, and passes under the hands of the cook, is more or less changed, and assumes new forms.
10136-8{_}918{_}Hence the influence of that functionary is immense upon the happiness of a household.
10136-8{_}919{_}77.
10136-8{_}920{_}In order that the duties of the Cook may be properly performed, and that he may be able to reproduce esteemed dishes with certainty, all terms of indecision should be banished from his art.
10136-8{_}921{_}Accordingly, what is known only to him, will, in these pages, be made known to others.
10136-8{_}922{_}In them all those indecisive terms expressed by a bit of this, some of that, a small piece of that, and a handful of the other, shall never be made use of, but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated.
10136-8{_}923{_}With a desire, also, that all ignorance on this most essential part of the culinary art should disappear, and that a uniform system of weights and measures should be adopted, we give an account of the weights which answer to certain measures.
10136-8{_}924{_}A TABLE-SPOONFUL is frequently mentioned in a recipe, in the prescriptions of medical men, and also in medical, chemical, and gastronomical works.
10136-8{_}925{_}By it is generally meant and understood a measure or bulk equal to that which would be produced by _half an ounce_ of water.
10136-8{_}926{_}A DESSERT-SPOONFUL is the half of a table-spoonful; that is to say, by it is meant a measure or bulk equal to a _quarter of an ounce_ of water.
10136-8{_}927{_}A TEA-SPOONFUL is equal in quantity to a _drachm_ of water.
10136-8{_}928{_}A DROP.--This is the name of a vague kind of measure, and is so called on account of the liquid being _dropped_ from the mouth of a bottle.
10136-8{_}929{_}Its quantity, however, will vary, either from the consistency of the liquid or the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle.
10136-8{_}930{_}The College of Physicians determined the quantity of a drop to be _one grain_, 60 drops making one fluid drachm.
10136-8{_}931{_}Their drop, or sixtieth part of a fluid drachm, is called a _minim_.
10136-8{_}932{_}[Illustration: _Fig_.
10136-8{_}933{_}22.]
10136-8{_}934{_}Graduated class measures can be obtained at any chemist's, and     they save much trouble.
10136-8{_}935{_}One of these, containing a wine pint, is     divided into 16 oz., and the oz, into 8 drachms of water; by     which, any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be     accurately measured out.
10136-8{_}936{_}Home-made measures of this kind can     readily be formed by weighing the water contained in any given     measure, and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies.
10136-8{_}937{_}This mark can easily be made with a file.
10136-8{_}938{_}It will be interesting     to many readers to know the basis on which the French found     their system of weights and measures, for it certainly possesses     the grandeur of simplicity.
10136-8{_}939{_}The metre, which is the basis of the     whole system of French weights and measures, is the exact     measurement of one forty-millionth part of a meridian of the     earth.
10136-8{_}940{_}78.
10136-8{_}941{_}EXCELLENCE IN THE ART OF COOKERY, as in all other things, is only attainable by practice and experience.
10136-8{_}942{_}In proportion, therefore, to the opportunities which a cook has had of these, so will be his excellence in the art.
10136-8{_}943{_}It is in the large establishments of princes, noblemen, and very affluent families alone, that the man cook is found in this country.
10136-8{_}944{_}He, also, superintends the kitchens of large hotels, clubs, and public institutions, where he, usually, makes out the bills of fare, which are generally submitted to the principal for approval.
10136-8{_}945{_}To be able to do this, therefore, it is absolutely necessary that he should be a judge of the season of every dish, as well as know perfectly the state of every article he undertakes to prepare.
10136-8{_}946{_}He must also be a judge of every article he buys; for no skill, however great it may be, will enable him to, make that good which is really bad.
10136-8{_}947{_}On him rests the responsibility of the cooking generally, whilst a speciality of his department, is to prepare the rich soups, stews, ragouts, and such dishes as enter into the more refined and complicated portions of his art, and such as are not usually understood by ordinary professors.
10136-8{_}948{_}He, therefore, holds a high position in a household, being inferior in rank, as already shown (21), only to the house steward, the valet, and the butler.
10136-8{_}949{_}In the luxurious ages of Grecian antiquity, Sicilian cooks were     the most esteemed, and received high rewards for their services.
10136-8{_}950{_}Among them, one called Trimalcio was such an adept in his art,     that he could impart to common fish both the form and flavour of     the most esteemed of the piscatory tribes.
10136-8{_}951{_}A chief cook in the     palmy days of Roman voluptuousness had about £800 a year, and     Antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased     Cleopatra, with the present of a city.
10136-8{_}952{_}With the fall of the     empire, the culinary art sank into less consideration.
10136-8{_}953{_}In the     middle ages, cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their     sauces, which they composed of strange combinations, for the     sake of novelty, as well as singularity.
10136-8{_}954{_}79.
10136-8{_}955{_}THE DUTIES OF THE COOK, THE KITCHEN AND THE SCULLERY MAIDS, are so intimately associated, that they can hardly be treated of separately.
10136-8{_}956{_}The cook, however, is at the head of the kitchen; and in proportion to her possession of the qualities of cleanliness, neatness, order, regularity, and celerity of action, so will her influence appear in the conduct of those who are under her; as it is upon her that the whole responsibility of the business of the kitchen rests, whilst the others must lend her, both a ready and a willing assistance, and be especially tidy in their appearance, and active, in their movements.
10136-8{_}957{_}In the larger establishments of the middle ages, cooks, with the     authority of feudal chiefs, gave their orders from a high chair     in which they ensconced themselves, and commanded a view of all     that was going on throughout their several domains.
10136-8{_}958{_}Each held a     long wooden spoon, with which he tasted, without leaving his     seat, the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves,     and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs     of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated     over their diligence and temperance.
10136-8{_}959{_}80.
10136-8{_}960{_}IF, AS WE HAVE SAID (3), THE QUALITY OF EARLY RISING be of the first importance to the mistress, what must it be to the servant!
10136-8{_}961{_}Let it, therefore, be taken as a long-proved truism, that without it, in every domestic, the effect of all things else, so far as _work_ is concerned, may, in a great measure, be neutralized.
10136-8{_}962{_}In a cook, this quality is most essential; for an hour lost in the morning, will keep her toiling, absolutely toiling, all day, to overtake that which might otherwise have been achieved with ease.
10136-8{_}963{_}In large establishments, six is a good hour to rise in the summer, and seven in the winter.
10136-8{_}964{_}81.
10136-8{_}965{_}HER FIRST DUTY, in large establishments and where it is requisite, should be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls, provided this has not been done on the previous night, and then to engage herself with those numerous little preliminary occupations which may not inappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day.
10136-8{_}966{_}This will bring in the breakfast hour of eight, after which, directions must be given, and preparations made, for the different dinners of the household and family.
10136-8{_}967{_}82.
10136-8{_}968{_}IN THOSE NUMEROUS HOUSEHOLDS where a cook and housemaid are only kept, the general custom is, that the cook should have the charge of the dining-room.
10136-8{_}969{_}The hall, the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to her care, and any other work there may be on the outside of the house.
10136-8{_}970{_}In establishments of this kind, the cook will, after having lighted her kitchen fire, carefully brushed the range, and cleaned the hearth, proceed to prepare for breakfast.
10136-8{_}971{_}She will thoroughly rinse the kettle, and, filling it with fresh water, will put it on the fire to boil.
10136-8{_}972{_}She will then go to the breakfast-room, or parlour, and there make all things ready for the breakfast of the family.
10136-8{_}973{_}Her attention will next be directed to the hall, which she will sweep and wipe; the kitchen stairs, if there be any, will now be swept; and the hall mats, which have been removed and shaken, will be again put in their places.
10136-8{_}974{_}The cleaning of the kitchen, pantry, passages, and kitchen     stairs must always be over before breakfast, so that it may not     interfere with the other business of the day.
10136-8{_}975{_}Everything should     be ready, and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect     when the heads of the house and members of the family make their     appearance.
10136-8{_}976{_}Nothing, it may be depended on, will so please the     mistress of an establishment, as to notice that, although she     has not been present to see that the work was done, attention to     smaller matters has been carefully paid, with a view to giving     her satisfaction and increasing her comfort.
10136-8{_}977{_}83.
10136-8{_}978{_}BY THE TIME THAT THE COOK has performed the duties mentioned above, and well swept, brushed, and dusted her kitchen, the breakfast-bell will most likely summon her to the parlour, to "bring in" the breakfast.
10136-8{_}979{_}It is the cook's department, generally, in the smaller establishments, to wait at breakfast, as the housemaid, by this time, has gone up-stairs into the bedrooms, and has there applied herself to her various duties.
10136-8{_}980{_}The cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the early part of the morning, as the tradesmen, with whom it is her more special business to speak, call at these hours.
10136-8{_}981{_}84.
10136-8{_}982{_}IT IS IN HER PREPARATION OF THE DINNER that the cook begins to feel the weight and responsibility of her situation, as she must take upon herself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes, which her skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared.
10136-8{_}983{_}Whilst these, however, are cooking, she must be busy with her pastry, soups, gravies, ragouts, &c. Stock, or what the French call _consommé_, being the basis of most made dishes, must be always at hand, in conjunction with her sweet herbs and spices for seasoning.
10136-8{_}984{_}"A place for everything, and everything in its place," must be her rule, in order that time may not be wasted in looking for things when they are wanted, and in order that the whole apparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a well-adjusted machine;--all must go on simultaneously.
10136-8{_}985{_}The vegetables and sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany, and in order that they may be suitable, the smallest oversight must not be made in their preparation.
10136-8{_}986{_}When the dinner-hour has arrived, it is the duty of the cook to dish-up such dishes as may, without injury, stand, for some time, covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet; but such as are of a more important or _recherché_ kind, must be delayed until the order "to serve" is given from the drawing-room.
10136-8{_}987{_}Then comes haste; but there must be no hurry,--all must work with order.
10136-8{_}988{_}The cook takes charge of the fish, soups, and poultry; and the kitchen-maid of the vegetables, sauces, and gravies.
10136-8{_}989{_}These she puts into their appropriate dishes, whilst the scullery-maid waits on and assists the cook.
10136-8{_}990{_}Everything must be timed so as to prevent its getting cold, whilst great care should be taken, that, between the first and second courses, no more time is allowed to elapse than is necessary, for fear that the company in the dining-room lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner.
10136-8{_}991{_}When the dinner has been served, the most important feature in the daily life of the cook is at an end.
10136-8{_}992{_}She must, however, now begin to look to the contents of her larder, taking care to keep everything sweet and clean, so that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies, milk, or meat that may be there.
10136-8{_}993{_}These are the principal duties of a cook in a first-rate establishment.
10136-8{_}994{_}In smaller establishments, the housekeeper often conducts the higher department of cooking (_see_ 58, 59, 60), and the cook, with the assistance of a scullery-maid, performs some of the subordinate duties of the kitchen-maid.
10136-8{_}995{_}When circumstances render it necessary, the cook engages to perform the whole of the work of the kitchen, and, in some places, a portion of the house-work also.
10136-8{_}996{_}85.
10136-8{_}997{_}WHILST THE COOK IS ENGAGED WITH HER MORNING DUTIES, the kitchen-maid is also occupied with hers.
10136-8{_}998{_}Her first duty, after the fire is lighted, is to sweep and clean the kitchen, and the various offices belonging to it.
10136-8{_}999{_}This she does every morning, besides cleaning the stone steps at the entrance of the house, the halls, the passages, and the stairs which lead to the kitchen.
10136-8{_}1000{_}Her general duties, besides these, are to wash and scour all these places twice a week, with the tables, shelves, and cupboards.
10136-8{_}1001{_}She has also to dress the nursery and servants'-hall dinners, to prepare all fish, poultry, and vegetables, trim meat joints and cutlets, and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the cook's department in a subordinate degree.
10136-8{_}1002{_}86.
10136-8{_}1003{_}THE DUTIES OF THE SCULLERY-MAID are to assist the cook; to keep the scullery clean, and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils.
10136-8{_}1004{_}The position of scullery-maid is not, of course, one of high     rank, nor is the payment for her services large.
10136-8{_}1005{_}But if she be     fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen-maid and clever     cook, she may very soon learn to perform various little duties     connected with cooking operations, which may be of considerable     service in fitting her for a more responsible place.
10136-8{_}1006{_}Now, it     will be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers, that     the fascinations connected with the position of the     scullery-maid, are not so great as to induce many people to     leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery.
10136-8{_}1007{_}But we     are acquainted with one instance in which the desire, on the     part of a young girl, was so strong to become connected with the     kitchen and cookery, that she absolutely left her parents, and     engaged herself as a scullery-maid in a gentleman's house.
10136-8{_}1008{_}Here     she showed herself so active and intelligent, that she very     quickly rose to the rank of kitchen-maid; and from this, so     great was her gastronomical genius, she became, in a short space     of time, one of the best women-cooks in England.
10136-8{_}1009{_}After this, we     think, it must be allowed, that a cook, like a poet, _nascitur,     non fit_.
10136-8{_}1010{_}87.
10136-8{_}1011{_}MODERN COOKERY stands so greatly indebted to the gastronomic propensities of our French neighbours, that many of their terms are adopted and applied by English artists to the same as well as similar preparations of their own.
10136-8{_}1012{_}A vocabulary of these is, therefore, indispensable in a work of this kind.
10136-8{_}1013{_}Accordingly, the following will be found sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes:--   EXPLANATION OF FRENCH TERMS USED IN MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.
10136-8{_}1014{_}ASPIC.--A savoury jelly, used as an exterior moulding for cold game, poultry, fish, &c. This, being of a transparent nature, allows the bird which it covers to be seen through it.
10136-8{_}1015{_}This may also be used for decorating or garnishing.
10136-8{_}1016{_}ASSIETTE (plate).--_Assiettes_ are the small _entrées_ and _hors-d'oeuvres_, the quantity of which does not exceed what a plate will hold.
10136-8{_}1017{_}At dessert, fruits, cheese, chestnuts, biscuits, &c., if served upon a plate, are termed _assiettes_.--ASSIETTE VOLANTE is a dish which a servant hands round to the guests, but is not placed upon the table.

10136-8{_}1021{_}This is very useful for keeping articles hot, without altering their quantity or quality.
10136-8{_}1022{_}If you keep sauce, broth, or soup by the fireside, the soup reduces and becomes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as reduces; but this is prevented by using the _bain-marie_, in which the water should be very hot, but not boiling.
10136-8{_}1023{_}BÉCHAMEL.--French white sauce, now frequently used in English cookery.
10136-8{_}1024{_}BLANCH.--To whiten poultry, vegetables, fruit, &c., by plunging them into boiling water for a short time, and afterwards plunging them into cold water, there to remain until they are cold.

10136-8{_}1083{_}[Illustration]  SOUPS.
10136-8{_}1084{_}CHAPTER V.   GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUPS.
10136-8{_}1085{_}88.
10136-8{_}1086{_}LEAN, JUICY BEEF, MUTTON, AND VEAL, form the basis of all good soups; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and such as are fresh-killed.
10136-8{_}1087{_}Stale meat renders them bad, and fat is not so well adapted for making them.
10136-8{_}1088{_}The principal art in composing good rich soup, is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another, and that all the articles of which it is composed, shall form an agreeable whole.
10136-8{_}1089{_}To accomplish this, care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned, and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients.
10136-8{_}1090{_}Generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups, and half the quantity for gravies.
10136-8{_}1091{_}In making soups or gravies, gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best.
10136-8{_}1092{_}It may be remarked, however, that a really good soup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel, although, perhaps, greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air.
10136-8{_}1093{_}Soups will, in general, take from three to six hours doing, and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted.
10136-8{_}1094{_}When the soup is cold, the fat may be much more easily and completely removed; and when it is poured off, care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve.
10136-8{_}1095{_}A tamis is the best strainer, and if the soup is strained while it is hot, let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water.
10136-8{_}1096{_}Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups about the consistence of cream.
10136-8{_}1097{_}To thicken and give body to soups and gravies, potato-mucilage, arrow-root, bread-raspings, isinglass, flour and butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal, in a little water rubbed well together, are used.
10136-8{_}1098{_}A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp, with a bit of butter and flour, and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually incorporated with the soup, will be found an excellent addition.
10136-8{_}1099{_}When the soup appears to be _too thin_ or _too weak_, the cover of the boiler should be taken off, and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated; or some of the thickening materials, above mentioned, should be added.
10136-8{_}1100{_}When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar.
10136-8{_}1101{_}In temperate weather, every other day may be sufficient.
10136-8{_}1102{_}89.
10136-8{_}1103{_}VARIOUS HERBS AND VEGETABLES are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies.
10136-8{_}1104{_}Of these the principal are,--Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, oatmeal, bread-raspings, pease, beans, rice, vermicelli, macaroni, isinglass, potato-mucilage, mushroom or mushroom ketchup, champignons, parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips, garlic, shalots, and onions.
10136-8{_}1105{_}Sliced onions, fried with butter and flour till they are browned, and then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to heighten the colour and flavour of brown soups and sauces, and form the basis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook.
10136-8{_}1106{_}The older and drier the onion, the stronger will be its flavour.
10136-8{_}1107{_}Leeks, cucumber, or burnet vinegar; celery or celery-seed pounded.
10136-8{_}1108{_}The latter, though equally strong, does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh vegetable; and when used as a substitute, its flavour should be corrected by the addition of a bit of sugar.
10136-8{_}1109{_}Cress-seed, parsley, common thyme, lemon thyme, orange thyme, knotted marjoram, sage, mint, winter savoury, and basil.
10136-8{_}1110{_}As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured, and its fine flavour is soon lost, the best way of preserving the extract is by pouring wine on the fresh leaves.
10136-8{_}1111{_}90.
10136-8{_}1112{_}FOR THE SEASONING OF SOUPS, bay-leaves, tomato, tarragon, chervil, burnet, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, mace, black and white pepper, essence of anchovy, lemon-peel, and juice, and Seville orange-juice, are all taken.
10136-8{_}1113{_}The latter imparts a finer flavour than the lemon, and the acid is much milder.
10136-8{_}1114{_}These materials, with wine, mushroom ketchup, Harvey's sauce, tomato sauce, combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients, manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies.
10136-8{_}1115{_}Soups, which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal, certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces, which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish.
10136-8{_}1116{_}SOUP, BROTH AND BOUILLON.
10136-8{_}1117{_}91.
10136-8{_}1118{_}IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED, that English cookery is, nationally speaking, far from being the best in the world.
10136-8{_}1119{_}More than this, we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers, half philosophers, half _chefs_, that we are the _worst_ cooks on the face of the earth, and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food, and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers, is peculiarly applicable to us islanders.
10136-8{_}1120{_}Not, however, to the inhabitants of the whole island; for, it is stated in a work which treats of culinary operations, north of the Tweed, that the "broth" of Scotland claims, for excellence and wholesomeness, a very close second place to the _bouillon_, or common soup of France.
10136-8{_}1121{_}"_Three_ hot meals of broth and meat, for about the price of ONE roasting joint," our Scottish brothers and sisters get, they say; and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very well-ascertained fact.
10136-8{_}1122{_}We are glad to note, however, that soups of vegetables, fish, meat, and game, are now very frequently found in the homes of the English middle classes, as well as in the mansions of the wealthier and more aristocratic; and we take this to be one evidence, that we are on the right road to an improvement in our system of cookery.
10136-8{_}1123{_}One great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badly-cooked meats which are brought to our tables, arises, we think, and most will agree with us, from a non-acquaintance with "common, every-day things."
10136-8{_}1124{_}Entertaining this view, we intend to preface the chapters of this work with a simple scientific _résumé_ of all those causes and circumstances which relate to the food we have to prepare, and the theory and chemistry of the various culinary operations.
10136-8{_}1125{_}Accordingly, this is the proper place to treat of the quality of the flesh of animals, and describe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad.
10136-8{_}1126{_}We will, therefore, commence with the circumstance of _age_, and examine how far this affects the quality of meat.
10136-8{_}1127{_}92.
10136-8{_}1128{_}DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE BIRTH AND MATURITY OF ANIMALS, their flesh undergoes very considerable changes.
10136-8{_}1129{_}For instance, when the animal is young, the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain, possess a large proportion of what is called _albumen_.
10136-8{_}1130{_}This albumen, which is also the chief component of the white of eggs, possesses the peculiarity of coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature, like the white of a boiled egg, into a soft, white fluid, no longer soluble, or capable of being dissolved in water.
10136-8{_}1131{_}As animals grow older, this peculiar animal matter gradually decreases, in proportion to the other constituents of the juice of the flesh.
10136-8{_}1132{_}Thus, the reason why veal, lamb, and young pork are _white, and without gravy_ when cooked, is, that the large quantity of albumen they contain hardens, or becomes coagulated.
10136-8{_}1133{_}On the other hand, the reason why beef and mutton are _brown, and have gravy_, is, that the proportion of albumen they contain, is small, in comparison with their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble, and not coagulable.
10136-8{_}1134{_}93.
10136-8{_}1135{_}THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH OF AN ANIMAL is considerably influenced by the nature of the _food on which it has been fed_; for the food supplies the material which produces the flesh.
10136-8{_}1136{_}If the food be not suitable and good, the meat cannot be good either; just as the paper on which these words are printed, could not be good, if the rags from which it is made, were not of a fine quality.
10136-8{_}1137{_}To the experienced in this matter, it is well known that the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce, such as corn, pulse, &c., is firm, well-flavoured, and also economical in the cooking; that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances, such as roots, possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree; whilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil, as linseed, is greasy, high coloured, and gross in the fat, and if the food has been used in large quantities, possessed of a rank flavour.
10136-8{_}1138{_}94.
10136-8{_}1139{_}IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE GOOD QUALITY OF MEAT, that the animal should be _perfectly healthy_ at the time of its slaughter.
10136-8{_}1140{_}However slight the disease in an animal may be, inferiority in the quality of its flesh, as food, is certain to be produced.
10136-8{_}1141{_}In most cases, indeed, as the flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction, it becomes not only unwholesome, but absolutely poisonous, on account of the absorption of the _virus_ of the unsound meat into the systems of those who partake of it.
10136-8{_}1142{_}The external indications of good and bad meat will be described under its own particular head, but we may here premise that the layer of all wholesome meat, when freshly killed, adheres firmly to the bone.
10136-8{_}1143{_}95.
10136-8{_}1144{_}ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE GREATLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF MEAT, is the animal's treatment _before it is slaughtered_.
10136-8{_}1145{_}This influences its value and wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree.
10136-8{_}1146{_}It will be easy to understand this, when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained.
10136-8{_}1147{_}These are, the digestion of its food, and the assimilation of that food into its substance.
10136-8{_}1148{_}Nature, in effecting this process, first reduces the food in the stomach to a state of pulp, under the name of chyme, which passes into the intestines, and is there divided into two principles, each distinct from the other.
10136-8{_}1149{_}One, a milk-white fluid,--the nutritive portion,--is absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous membrane, or inner coat of the intestines.
10136-8{_}1150{_}These vessels, or absorbents, discharge the fluid into a common duct, or road, along which it is conveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart.
10136-8{_}1151{_}Here it is mixed with the venous blood (which is black and impure) returning from every part of the body, and then it supplies the waste which is occasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial (or pure) blood having furnished matter for the substance of the animal.
10136-8{_}1152{_}The blood of the animal having completed its course through all parts, and having had its waste recruited by the digested food, is now received into the heart, and by the action of that organ it is urged through the lungs, there to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales.
10136-8{_}1153{_}Again returning to the heart, it is forced through the arteries, and thence distributed, by innumerable ramifications, called capillaries, bestowing to every part of the animal, life and nutriment.
10136-8{_}1154{_}The other principle--the innutritive portion--passes from the intestines, and is thus got rid of.
10136-8{_}1155{_}It will now be readily understood how flesh is affected for bad, if an animal is slaughtered when the circulation of its blood has been increased by over-driving, ill-usage, or other causes of excitement, to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the capillaries to perform their functions, and causing the blood to be congealed in its minuter vessels.
10136-8{_}1156{_}Where this has been the case, the meat will be dark-coloured, and become rapidly putrid; so that self-interest and humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals destined to serve as food for man.
10136-8{_}1157{_}THE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP-MAKING.
10136-8{_}1158{_}96.
10136-8{_}1159{_}STOCK BEING THE BASIS of all meat soups, and, also, of all the principal sauces, it is essential to the success of these culinary operations, to know the most complete and economical method of extracting, from a certain quantity of meat, the best possible stock or broth.
10136-8{_}1160{_}The theory and philosophy of this process we will, therefore, explain, and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted.
10136-8{_}1161{_}97.
10136-8{_}1162{_}AS ALL MEAT is principally composed of fibres, fat, gelatine, osmazome, and albumen, it is requisite to know that the FIBRES are inseparable, constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it has undergone a long boiling.
10136-8{_}1163{_}98.
10136-8{_}1164{_}FAT is dissolved by boiling; but as it is contained in cells covered by a very fine membrane, which never dissolves, a portion of it always adheres to the fibres.
10136-8{_}1165{_}The other portion rises to the surface of the stock, and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not whole, or which have burst by boiling.
10136-8{_}1166{_}99.
10136-8{_}1167{_}GELATINE is soluble: it is the basis and the nutritious portion of the stock.
10136-8{_}1168{_}When there is an abundance of it, it causes the stock, when cold, to become a jelly.
10136-8{_}1169{_}100.
10136-8{_}1170{_}OSMAZOME is soluble even when cold, and is that part of the meat which gives flavour and perfume to the stock.
10136-8{_}1171{_}The flesh of old animals contains more _osmazome_ than that of young ones.
10136-8{_}1172{_}Brown meats contain more than white, and the former make the stock more fragrant.
10136-8{_}1173{_}By roasting meat, the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties; so, by putting the remains of roast meats into your stock-pot, you obtain a better flavour.
10136-8{_}1174{_}101.
10136-8{_}1175{_}ALBUMEN is of the nature of the white of eggs; it can be dissolved in cold or tepid water, but coagulates when it is put into water not quite at the boiling-point.
10136-8{_}1176{_}From this property in albumen, it is evident that if the meat is put into the stock-pot when the water boils, or after this is made to boil up quickly, the albumen, in both cases, hardens.
10136-8{_}1177{_}In the first it rises to the surface, in the second it remains in the meat, but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from dissolving; and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained.
10136-8{_}1178{_}It ought to be known, too, that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat, always takes place, more or less, according to the size of the piece, as the parts farthest from the surface always acquire _that degree_ of heat which congeals it before entirely dissolving it.
10136-8{_}1179{_}102.
10136-8{_}1180{_}BONES ought always to form a component part of the stock-pot.
10136-8{_}1181{_}They are composed of an earthy substance,--to which they owe their solidity,--of gelatine, and a fatty fluid, something like marrow.
10136-8{_}1182{_}_Two ounces_ of them contain as much gelatine as _one pound_ of meat; but in them, this is so incased in the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of whole bones.
10136-8{_}1183{_}By breaking them, however, you can dissolve more, because you multiply their surfaces; and by reducing them to powder or paste, you can dissolve them entirely; but you must not grind them dry.
10136-8{_}1184{_}We have said (99) that gelatine forms the basis of stock; but this, though very nourishing, is entirely without taste; and to make the stock savoury, it must contain _osmazome_.
10136-8{_}1185{_}Of this, bones do not contain a particle; and that is the reason why stock made entirely of them, is not liked; but when you add meat to the broken or pulverized bones, the osmazome contained in it makes the stock sufficiently savoury.
10136-8{_}1186{_}103.
10136-8{_}1187{_}In concluding this part of our subject, the following condensed hints and directions should be attended to in the economy of soup-making:--  I.
10136-8{_}1188{_}BEEF MAKES THE BEST STOCK; veal stock has less colour and taste; whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell, far from agreeable, unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled.
10136-8{_}1189{_}Fowls add very little to the flavour of stock, unless they be old and fat.
10136-8{_}1190{_}Pigeons, when they are old, add the most flavour to it; and a rabbit or partridge is also a great improvement.
10136-8{_}1191{_}From the freshest meat the best stock is obtained.
10136-8{_}1192{_}II.
10136-8{_}1193{_}IF THE MEAT BE BOILED solely to make stock, it must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces; but, generally speaking, if it is desired to have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well, it is necessary to put a rather large piece into the stock-pot, say sufficient for two or three days, during which time the stock will keep well in all weathers.
10136-8{_}1194{_}Choose the freshest meat, and have it cut as thick as possible; for if it is a thin, flat piece, it will not look well, and will be very soon spoiled by the boiling.
10136-8{_}1195{_}III.
10136-8{_}1196{_}NEVER WASH MEAT, as it deprives its surface of all its juices; separate it from the bones, and tie it round with tape, so that its shape may be preserved, then put it into the stock-pot, and for each pound of meat, let there be one pint of water; press it down with the hand, to allow the air, which it contains, to escape, and which often raises it to the top of the water.
10136-8{_}1197{_}IV.
10136-8{_}1198{_}PUT THE STOCK-POT ON A GENTLE FIRE, so that it may heat gradually.
10136-8{_}1199{_}The albumen will first dissolve, afterwards coagulate; and as it is in this state lighter than the liquid, it will rise to the surface; bringing with it all its impurities.
10136-8{_}1200{_}It is this which makes _the scum_.
10136-8{_}1201{_}The rising of the hardened albumen has the same effect in clarifying stock as the white of eggs; and, as a rule, it may be said that the more scum there is, the clearer will be the stock.
10136-8{_}1202{_}Always take care that the fire is very regular.
10136-8{_}1203{_}V. REMOVE THE SCUM when it rises thickly, and do not let the stock boil, because then one portion of the scum will be dissolved, and the other go to the bottom of the pot; thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a clear broth.
10136-8{_}1204{_}If the fire is regular, it will not be necessary to add cold water in order to make the scum rise; but if the fire is too large at first, it will then be necessary to do so.
10136-8{_}1205{_}VI.
10136-8{_}1206{_}WHEN THE STOCK IS WELL SKIMMED, and begins to boil, put in salt and vegetables, which may be two or three carrots, two turnips, one parsnip, a bunch of leeks and celery tied together.
10136-8{_}1207{_}You can add, according to taste, a piece of cabbage, two or three cloves stuck in an onion, and a tomato.
10136-8{_}1208{_}The latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock.
10136-8{_}1209{_}If fried onion be added, it ought, according to the advice of a famous French _chef_, to be tied in a little bag: without this precaution, the colour of the stock is liable to be clouded.
10136-8{_}1210{_}VII.
10136-8{_}1211{_}BY THIS TIME we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones which were separated from the meat, and those which were left from the roast meat of the day before.
10136-8{_}1212{_}Remember, as was before pointed out, that the more these are broken, the more gelatine you will have.
10136-8{_}1213{_}The best way to break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar, adding, from time to time, a little water, to prevent them getting heated.
10136-8{_}1214{_}It is a great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat, which, in too many English families, we fear, are entirely wasted; for it is certain, as previously stated (No.
10136-8{_}1215{_}102), that two ounces of bone contain as much gelatine (which is the nutritive portion of stock) as one pound of meat.
10136-8{_}1216{_}In their broken state tie them up in a bag, and put them in the stock-pot; adding the gristly parts of cold meat, and trimmings, which can be used for no other purpose.
10136-8{_}1217{_}If, to make up the weight, you have received from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal, broil it slightly over a clear fire before putting it in the stock-pot, and be very careful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or burnt.
10136-8{_}1218{_}VIII.
10136-8{_}1219{_}ADD NOW THE VEGETABLES, which, to a certain extent, will stop the boiling of the stock.
10136-8{_}1220{_}Wait, therefore, till it simmers well up again, then draw it to the side of the fire, and keep it gently simmering till it is served, preserving, as before said, your fire always the same.
10136-8{_}1221{_}Cover the stock-pot well, to prevent evaporation; do not fill it up, even if you take out a little stock, unless the meat is exposed; in which case a little boiling water may be added, but only enough to cover it.
10136-8{_}1222{_}After six hours' slow and gentle simmering, the stock is done; and it should not be continued on the fire, longer than is necessary, or it will tend to insipidity.
10136-8{_}1223{_}_Note_.--It is on a good stock, or first good broth and sauce, that excellence in cookery depends.
10136-8{_}1224{_}If the preparation of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons, and the stock is not well skimmed, but indifferent results will be obtained.
10136-8{_}1225{_}The stock will never be clear; and when it is obliged to be clarified, it is deteriorated both in quality and flavour.
10136-8{_}1226{_}In the proper management of the stock-pot an immense deal of trouble is saved, inasmuch as one stock, in a small dinner, serves for all purposes.
10136-8{_}1227{_}Above all things, the greatest economy, consistent with excellence, should be practised, and the price of everything which enters the kitchen correctly ascertained.
10136-8{_}1228{_}The _theory_ of this part of Household Management may appear trifling; but its practice is extensive, and therefore it requires the best attention.

10136-8{_}1231{_}FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS.
10136-8{_}1232{_}[_It will be seen, by reference to the following Recipes, that an entirely original and most intelligible system has been pursued in explaining the preparation of each dish.
10136-8{_}1233{_}We would recommend the young housekeeper, cook, or whoever may be engaged in the important task of "getting ready" the dinner, or other meal, to follow precisely the order in which the recipes are given.
10136-8{_}1234{_}Thus, let them first place on their table all the INGREDIENTS necessary; then the modus operandi, or MODE of preparation, will be easily managed.
10136-8{_}1235{_}By a careful reading, too, of the recipes, there will not be the slightest difficulty in arranging a repast for any number of persons, and an accurate notion will be gained of the TIME the cooling of each dish will occupy, of the periods at which it is SEASONABLE, as also of its_ AVERAGE COST.
10136-8{_}1236{_}_The addition of the natural history, and the description of the various properties of the edible articles in common use in every family, will be serviceable both in a practical and an educational point of view._  _Speaking specially of the Recipes for Soups, it may be added, that by the employment of the_ BEST, MEDIUM, _or_ COMMON STOCK, _the quality of the Soups and their cost may be proportionately increased or lessened._]   STOCKS FOR ALL KINDS OF SOUPS.

10136-8{_}1306{_}_Mode_.--Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear, and that its quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of 2 eggs, carefully separated from their yolks, whisk them well together with the water, and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock, still whisking.
10136-8{_}1307{_}Place the soup on the fire, and when boiling and well skimmed, whisk the eggs with it till nearly boiling again; then draw it from the fire, and let it settle, until the whites of the eggs become separated.
10136-8{_}1308{_}Pass through a fine cloth, and the soup should be clear.
10136-8{_}1309{_}_Note_.--The rule is, that all clear soups should be of a light straw colour, and should not savour too strongly of the meat; and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot.
10136-8{_}1310{_}All _purées_ should be somewhat thicker.

10136-8{_}1316{_}of sweet almonds, the yolks of 6 eggs, 1 gill of thick cream, rather more than 2 quarts of water.
10136-8{_}1317{_}_Mode_.--Boil the beef, or veal, and the mutton, gently in water that will cover them, till the gravy is very strong, and the meat very tender; then strain off the gravy, and set it on the fire with the specified quantities of vermicelli, mace, and cloves, to 2 quarts.
10136-8{_}1318{_}Let it boil till it has the flavour of the spices.
10136-8{_}1319{_}Have ready the almonds, blanched and pounded very fine; the yolks of the eggs boiled hard; mixing the almonds, whilst pounding, with a little of the soup, lest the latter should grow oily.
10136-8{_}1320{_}Pound them till they are a mere pulp, and keep adding to them, by degrees, a little soup until they are thoroughly mixed together.

10136-8{_}1329{_}[Illustration: ALMOND & BLOSSOM.]
10136-8{_}1330{_}THE ALMOND-TREE.--This tree is indigenous to the northern parts     of Asia and Africa, but it is now cultivated in Europe,     especially in the south of France, Italy, and Spain.
10136-8{_}1331{_}It flowers     in spring, and produces its fruit in August.
10136-8{_}1332{_}Although there are     two kinds of almonds, the _sweet_ and the _bitter,_ they are     considered as only varieties of the same species.
10136-8{_}1333{_}The best sweet     almonds brought to England, are called the Syrian or Jordan, and     come from Malaga; the inferior qualities are brought from     Valentia and Italy.
10136-8{_}1334{_}_Bitter_ almonds come principally from     Magadore.
10136-8{_}1335{_}Anciently, the almond was much esteemed by the nations     of the East.
10136-8{_}1336{_}Jacob included it among the presents which he     designed for Joseph.
10136-8{_}1337{_}The Greeks called it the Greek or Thasian     nut, and the Romans believed that by eating half a dozen of     them, they were secured against drunkenness, however deeply they     might imbibe.
10136-8{_}1338{_}Almonds, however, are considered as very     indigestible.
10136-8{_}1339{_}The _bitter_ contain, too, principles which     produce two violent poisons,--prussic acid and a kind of     volatile oil.
10136-8{_}1340{_}It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large     quantities.
10136-8{_}1341{_}Almonds pounded together with a little sugar and     water, however, produce a milk similar to that which is yielded     by animals.
10136-8{_}1342{_}Their oil is used for making fine soap, and their     cake as a cosmetic.

10136-8{_}1353{_}[Illustration: APPLE AND BLOSSOM.]
10136-8{_}1354{_}THE APPLE.--This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ; and     Homer describes it as valuable in his time.
10136-8{_}1355{_}It was brought from     the East by the Romans, who held it in the highest estimation.
10136-8{_}1356{_}Indeed, some of the citizens of the "Eternal city" distinguished     certain favourite apples by their names.
10136-8{_}1357{_}Thus the Manlians were     called after Manlius, the Claudians after Claudius, and the     Appians after Appius.
10136-8{_}1358{_}Others were designated after the country     whence they were brought; as the Sidonians, the Epirotes, and     the Greeks.
10136-8{_}1359{_}The best varieties are natives of Asia, and have, by     grafting them upon others, been introduced into Europe.
10136-8{_}1360{_}The     crab, found in our hedges, is the only variety indigenous to     Britain; therefore, for the introduction of other kinds we are,     no doubt, indebted to the Romans.
10136-8{_}1361{_}In the time of the Saxon     heptarchy, both Devon and Somerset were distinguished as _the     apple country_; and there are still existing in Herefordshire     some trees said to have been planted in the time of William the     Conqueror.
10136-8{_}1362{_}From that time to this, the varieties of this     precious fruit have gone on increasing, and are now said to     number upwards of 1,500.
10136-8{_}1363{_}It is peculiar to the temperate zone,     being found neither in Lapland, nor within the tropics.
10136-8{_}1364{_}The best     baking apples for early use are the Colvilles; the best for     autumn are the rennets and pearmains; and the best for winter     and spring are russets.
10136-8{_}1365{_}The best table, or eating apples, are     the Margarets for early use; the Kentish codlin and summer     pearmain for summer; and for autumn, winter, or spring, the     Dowton, golden and other pippins, as the ribstone, with small     russets.
10136-8{_}1366{_}As a food, the apple cannot be considered to rank high,     as more than the half of it consists of water, and the rest of     its properties are not the most nourishing.
10136-8{_}1367{_}It is, however, a     useful adjunct to other kinds of food, and, when cooked, is     esteemed as slightly laxative.

10136-8{_}1407{_}[Illustration: ASPARAGUS.]
10136-8{_}1408{_}ASPARAGUS.--The ancients called all the sprouts of young     vegetables asparagus, whence the name, which is now limited to a     particular species, embracing artichoke, alisander, asparagus,     cardoon, rampion, and sea-kale.
10136-8{_}1409{_}They are originally mostly wild     seacoast plants; and, in this state, asparagus may still be     found on the northern as well as southern shores of Britain.
10136-8{_}1410{_}It     is often vulgarly called, in London, _sparrowgrass_; and, in     it's cultivated form, hardly bears any resemblance to the     original plant.
10136-8{_}1411{_}Immense quantities of it are raised for the     London market, at Mortlake and Deptford; but it belongs rather     to the classes of luxurious than necessary food.

10136-8{_}1437{_}BARLEY.--This, in the order of cereal grasses, is, in Britain,     the next plant to wheat in point of value, and exhibits several     species and varieties.
10136-8{_}1438{_}From what country it comes originally, is     not known, but it was cultivated in the earliest ages of     antiquity, as the Egyptians were afflicted with the loss of it     in the ear, in the time of Moses.
10136-8{_}1439{_}It was a favourite grain with     the Athenians, but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the     Romans.

10136-8{_}1457{_}[Illustration: QUERN, or GRINDING-MILL.]
10136-8{_}1458{_}BREAD.--The origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of     distant ages.
10136-8{_}1459{_}The Greeks attributed its invention to Pan; but     before they, themselves, had an existence, it was, no doubt, in     use among the primitive nations of mankind.
10136-8{_}1460{_}The Chaldeans and     the Egyptians were acquainted with it, and Sarah, the companion     of Abraham, mixed flour and water together, kneaded it, and     covered it with ashes on the hearth.
10136-8{_}1461{_}The Scriptures inform us     that leavened bread was known to the Israelites, but it is not     known when the art of fermenting it was discovered.
10136-8{_}1462{_}It is said     that the Romans learnt it during their wars with Perseus, king     of Macedon, and that it was introduced to the "imperial city"     about 200 years before the birth of Christ.
10136-8{_}1463{_}With them it no     doubt found its way into Britain; but after their departure from     the island, it probably ceased to be used.
10136-8{_}1464{_}We know that King     Alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherd's     cottage; and that, even in the sixteenth century, unfermented     cakes, kneaded by the women, were the only kind of bread known     to the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden.
10136-8{_}1465{_}The Italians of this     day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of     _polenta_, or soft pudding, vermicelli, and macaroni; and, in     the remoter districts of Scotland, much unfermented bread is     still used.
10136-8{_}1466{_}We give a cut of the _quern_ grinding-mill, which,     towards the end of the last century, was in use in that country,     and which is thus described by Dr. Johnson in his "Journey to     the Hebrides:"--"It consists of two stones about a foot and half     in diameter; the lower is a little convex, to which the     concavity of the upper must be fitted.
10136-8{_}1467{_}In the middle of the     upper stone is a round hole, and on one side is a long handle.
10136-8{_}1468{_}The grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one     hand, and works the handle round with the other.
10136-8{_}1469{_}The corn slides     down the convexity of the lower stone, and by the motion of the     upper, is ground in its passage."
10136-8{_}1470{_}Such a primitive piece of     machinery, it may safely be said, has entirely disappeared from     this country.--In other parts of this work, we shall have     opportunities of speaking of bread and bread-making, which, from     its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind, has     emphatically been called the "staff of life."
10136-8{_}1471{_}The necessity,     therefore, of having it both pure and good is of the first     importance.

10136-8{_}1484{_}[Illustration: CABBAGE SEEDING.]
10136-8{_}1485{_}THE CABBAGE.--It is remarkable, that although there is no     country in the world now more plentifully supplied with fruits     and vegetables than Great Britain, yet the greater number of     these had no existence in it before the time of Henry VIII.
10136-8{_}1486{_}Anderson, writing under the date of 1548, says, "The English     cultivated scarcely any vegetables before the last two     centuries.
10136-8{_}1487{_}At the commencement of the reign, of Henry VIII.
10136-8{_}1488{_}neither salad, nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any     other comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of     the kingdom; they came from Holland and Flanders."
10136-8{_}1489{_}The original     of all the cabbage tribe is the wild plant _sea-colewort_, which     is to be found _wasting_ whatever sweetness it may have on the     desert air, on many of the cliffs of the south coast of England.
10136-8{_}1490{_}In this state, it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce, yet,     in a cultivated state, to what dimensions can it be made to     grow!
10136-8{_}1491{_}However greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among     the moderns, by the ancients they were held in yet higher     estimation.
10136-8{_}1492{_}The Egyptians adored and raised altars to them, and     the Greeks and Romans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues     to them.
10136-8{_}1493{_}Cato affirmed, that the cabbage cured all diseases, and     declared, that it was to its use that the Romans were enabled to     live in health and without the assistance of physicians for 600     years.
10136-8{_}1494{_}It was introduced by that people into Germany, Gaul, and,     no doubt, Britain; although, in this last, it may have been     suffered to pass into desuetude for some centuries.

10136-8{_}1540{_}[Illustration: TAZZA AND CARROT LEAVES.]
10136-8{_}1541{_}THE CARROT.--There is a wild carrot which grows in England; but     it is white and small, and not much esteemed.
10136-8{_}1542{_}The garden carrot     in general use, was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,     and was, at first, so highly esteemed, that the ladies wore     leaves of it in their head-dresses.
10136-8{_}1543{_}It is of great value in the     culinary art, especially for soups and stews.
10136-8{_}1544{_}It can be used     also for beer instead of malt, and, in distillation, it yields a     large quantity of spirit.
10136-8{_}1545{_}The carrot is proportionably valuable     as it has more of the red than the yellow part.
10136-8{_}1546{_}There is a large     red variety much used by the farmers for colouring butter.
10136-8{_}1547{_}As a     garden vegetable, it is what is called the orange-carrot that is     usually cultivated.
10136-8{_}1548{_}As a fattening food for cattle, it is     excellent; but for man it is indigestible, on account of its     fibrous matter.
10136-8{_}1549{_}Of 1,000 parts, 95 consist of sugar, and 3 of     starch.--The accompanying cut represents a pretty winter     ornament, obtained by placing a cut from the top of the     carrot-root in a shallow vessel of water, when the young leaves     spring forth with a charming freshness and fullness.
10136-8{_}1550{_}CELERY SOUP.
10136-8{_}1551{_}122.
10136-8{_}1552{_}INGREDIENTS.--9 heads of celery, 1 teaspoonful of salt, nutmeg to taste, 1 lump of sugar, 1/2 pint of strong stock, a pint of cream, and 2 quarts of boiling water.
10136-8{_}1553{_}_Mode_.--Cut the celery into small pieces; throw it into the water, seasoned with the nutmeg, salt, and sugar.
10136-8{_}1554{_}Boil it till sufficiently tender; pass it through a sieve, add the stock, and simmer it for half an hour.
10136-8{_}1555{_}Now put in the cream, bring it to the boiling point, and serve immediately.
10136-8{_}1556{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}1557{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}1558{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}1559{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}1560{_}_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.
10136-8{_}1561{_}_Note_.--This soup can be made brown, instead of white, by omitting the cream, and colouring it a little.
10136-8{_}1562{_}When celery cannot be procured, half a drachm of the seed, finely pounded, will give a flavour to the soup, if put in a quarter of an hour before it is done.
10136-8{_}1563{_}A little of the essence of celery will answer the same purpose.
10136-8{_}1564{_}CELERY.--This plant is indigenous to Britain, and, in its wild     state, grows by the side of ditches and along some parts of the     seacoast.
10136-8{_}1565{_}In this state it is called _smallaqe_, and, to some     extent, is a dangerous narcotic.
10136-8{_}1566{_}By cultivation, however, it has     been brought to the fine flavour which the garden plant     possesses.
10136-8{_}1567{_}In the vicinity of Manchester it is raised to an     enormous size.
10136-8{_}1568{_}When our natural observation is assisted by the     accurate results ascertained by the light of science, how     infinitely does it enhance our delight in contemplating the     products of nature!
10136-8{_}1569{_}To know, for example, that the endless     variety of colour which we see in plants is developed only by     the rays of the sun, is to know a truism sublime by its very     comprehensiveness.
10136-8{_}1570{_}The cause of the whiteness of celery is     nothing more than the want of light in its vegetation, and in     order that this effect may be produced, the plant is almost     wholly covered with earth; the tops of the leaves alone being     suffered to appear above the ground.
10136-8{_}1571{_}CHANTILLY SOUP.
10136-8{_}1572{_}123.

10136-8{_}1574{_}105.
10136-8{_}1575{_}_Mode_.--Boil the peas till quite tender, with the parsley and onions; then rub them through a sieve, and pour the stock to them.
10136-8{_}1576{_}Do not let it boil after the peas are added, or you will spoil the colour.
10136-8{_}1577{_}Serve very hot.
10136-8{_}1578{_}_Time_.--Half an hour.
10136-8{_}1579{_}_Average_ cost, 1s.

10136-8{_}1581{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}1582{_}_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.
10136-8{_}1583{_}_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.
10136-8{_}1584{_}_Note_.--Cold peas pounded in a mortar, with a little stock added to them, make a very good soup in haste.
10136-8{_}1585{_}Parsley.--Among the Greeks, in the classic ages, a crown of     parsley was awarded, both in the Nemaean and Isthmian games, and     the voluptuous Anacreon pronounces this beautiful herb the     emblem of joy and festivity.
10136-8{_}1586{_}It has an elegant leaf, and is     extensively used in the culinary art.
10136-8{_}1587{_}When it was introduced to     Britain is not known.
10136-8{_}1588{_}There are several varieties,--the     _plain_-leaved and the _curled_-leaved, _celery_-parsley,     _Hamburg_ parsley, and _purslane_.
10136-8{_}1589{_}The curled is the best, and,     from the form of its leaf, has a beautiful appearance on a dish     as a garnish.
10136-8{_}1590{_}Its flavour is, to many, very agreeable in soups;     and although to rabbits, hares, and sheep it is a luxury, to     parrots it is a poison.
10136-8{_}1591{_}The celery-parsley is used as a celery,     and the Hamburg is cultivated only for its roots, which are used     as parsnips or carrots, to eat with meat.
10136-8{_}1592{_}The purslane is a     native of South America, and is not now much in use.
10136-8{_}1593{_}CHESTNUT (SPANISH) SOUP.
10136-8{_}1594{_}124.
10136-8{_}1595{_}INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb.

10136-8{_}1597{_}105.
10136-8{_}1598{_}_Mode_.--Take the outer rind from the chestnuts, and put them into a large pan of warm water.
10136-8{_}1599{_}As soon as this becomes too hot for the fingers to remain in it, take out the chestnuts, peel them quickly, and immerse them in cold water, and wipe and weigh them.
10136-8{_}1600{_}Now cover them with good stock, and stew them gently for rather more than 3/4 of an hour, or until they break when touched with a fork; then drain, pound, and rub them through a fine sieve reversed; add sufficient stock, mace, cayenne, and salt, and stir it often until it boils, and put in the cream.
10136-8{_}1601{_}The stock in which the chestnuts are boiled can be used for the soup, when its sweetness is not objected to, or it may, in part, be added to it; and the rule is, that 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}1602{_}of chestnuts should be given to each quart of soup.
10136-8{_}1603{_}_Time_.--rather more than 1 hour.

10136-8{_}1608{_}[Illustration: CHESTNUT.]
10136-8{_}1609{_}THE CHESTNUT.--This fruit is said, by some, to have originally     come from Sardis, in Lydia; and by others, from Castanea, a city     of Thessaly, from which it takes its name.
10136-8{_}1610{_}By the ancients it     was much used as a food, and is still common in France and     Italy, to which countries it is, by some, considered indigenous.
10136-8{_}1611{_}In the southern part of the European continent, it is eaten both     raw and roasted.
10136-8{_}1612{_}The tree was introduced into Britain by the     Romans; but it only flourishes in the warmer parts of the     island, the fruit rarely arriving at maturity in Scotland.
10136-8{_}1613{_}It     attains a great age, as well as an immense size.
10136-8{_}1614{_}As a food, it     is the least oily and most farinaceous of all the nuts, and,     therefore, the easiest of digestion.
10136-8{_}1615{_}The tree called the _horse     chestnut_ is very different, although its fruit very much     resembles that of the other.
10136-8{_}1616{_}Its "nuts," though eaten by horses     and some other animals, are unsuitable for human food.
10136-8{_}1617{_}COCOA-NUT SOUP.

10136-8{_}1632{_}[Illustration: NUT & BLOSSOM.]
10136-8{_}1633{_}THE COCOA-NUT.--This is the fruit of one of the palms, than     which it is questionable if there is any other species of tree     marking, in itself, so abundantly the goodness of Providence, in     making provision for the wants of man.
10136-8{_}1634{_}It grows wild in the     Indian seas, and in the eastern parts of Asia; and thence it has     been introduced into every part of the tropical regions.
10136-8{_}1635{_}To the     natives of those climates, its bark supplies the material for     creating their dwellings; its leaves, the means of roofing them;     and the leaf-stalks, a kind of gauze for covering their windows,     or protecting the baby in the cradle.
10136-8{_}1636{_}It is also made into     lanterns, masks to screen the face from the heat of the sun,     baskets, wicker-work, and even a kind of paper for writing on.
10136-8{_}1637{_}Combs, brooms, torches, ropes, matting, and sailcloth are made     of its fibers.
10136-8{_}1638{_}With these, too, beds are made and cushions     stuffed.
10136-8{_}1639{_}Oars are supplied by the leaves; drinking-cups, spoons,     and other domestic utensils by the shells of the nuts; milk by     its juice, of which, also, a kind of honey and sugar are     prepared.
10136-8{_}1640{_}When fermented, it furnishes the means of     intoxication; and when the fibres are burned, their ashes supply     an alkali for making soap.
10136-8{_}1641{_}The buds of the tree bear a striking     resemblance to cabbage when boiled; but when they are cropped,     the tree dies.
10136-8{_}1642{_}In a fresh state, the kernel is eaten raw, and     its juice is a most agreeable and refreshing beverage.
10136-8{_}1643{_}When the     nut is imported to this country, its fruit is, in general,     comparatively dry, and is considered indigestible.
10136-8{_}1644{_}The tree is     one of the least productive of the palm tribe.

10136-8{_}1660{_}[Illustration: THE LENTIL.]
10136-8{_}1661{_}THE LENTIL.--This belongs to the legumious or _pulse_ kind of     vegetables, which rank next to the corn plants in their     nutritive properties.
10136-8{_}1662{_}The lentil is a variety of the bean tribe,     but in England is not used as human food, although considered     the best of all kinds for pigeons.
10136-8{_}1663{_}On the Continent it is     cultivated for soups, as well as for other preparations for the     table; and among the presents which David received from Shobi,     as recounted in the Scriptures, were beans, lentils, and parched     pulse.
10136-8{_}1664{_}Among the Egyptians it was extensively used, and among     the Greeks, the Stoics had a maxim, which declared, that "a wise     man acts always with reason, and prepares his own lentils."
10136-8{_}1665{_}Among the Romans it was not much esteemed, and from them the     English may have inherited a prejudice against it, on account,     it is said, of its rendering men indolent.
10136-8{_}1666{_}It takes its name     from _lentus_ 'slow,' and, according to Pliny, produces mildness     and moderation of temper.

10136-8{_}1681{_}THE CUCUMBER.--The antiquity of this fruit is very great.
10136-8{_}1682{_}In the     sacred writings we find that the people of Israel regretted it,     whilst sojourning in the desert; and at the present time, the     cucumber, and other fruits of its class, form a large portion of     the food of the Egyptian people.
10136-8{_}1683{_}By the Eastern nations     generally, as well as by the Greeks and Romans, it was greatly     esteemed.
10136-8{_}1684{_}Like the melon, it was originally brought from Asia by     the Romans, and in the 14th century it was common in England,     although, in the time of the wars of "the Roses," it seems no     longer to have been cultivated.
10136-8{_}1685{_}It is a cold food, and of     difficult digestion when eaten raw.
10136-8{_}1686{_}As a preserved sweetmeat,     however, it is esteemed one of the most agreeable.

10136-8{_}1754{_}SORREL.--This is one of the _spinaceous_ plants, which take     their name from spinach, which is the chief among them.
10136-8{_}1755{_}It is     little used in English cookery, but a great deal in French, in     which it is employed for soups, sauces, and salads.
10136-8{_}1756{_}In English     meadows it is usually left to grow wild; but in France, where it     is cultivated, its flavour is greatly improved.

10136-8{_}1781{_}134.
10136-8{_}1782{_}INGREDIENTS.--A capon or large fowl (sometimes an old cock, from which the recipe takes its name, is used), which should be trussed as for boiling; 2 or 3 bunches of fine leeks, 5 quarts of stock No.
10136-8{_}1783{_}105, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}1784{_}_Mode_.--Well wash the leeks (and, if old, scald them in boiling water for a few minutes), taking off the roots and part of the heads, and cut them into lengths of about an inch.
10136-8{_}1785{_}Put the fowl into the stock, with, at first, one half of the leeks, and allow it to simmer gently.
10136-8{_}1786{_}In half an hour add the remaining leeks, and then it may simmer for 3 or 4 hours longer.
10136-8{_}1787{_}It should be carefully skimmed, and can be seasoned to taste.
10136-8{_}1788{_}In serving, take out the fowl, and carve it neatly, placing the pieces in a tureen, and pouring over them the soup, which should be very thick of leeks (a _purée_ of leeks the French would call it).

10136-8{_}1795{_}_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.
10136-8{_}1796{_}_Note_.--Without the fowl, the above, which would then be merely called leek soup, is very good, and also economical.
10136-8{_}1797{_}Cock-a-leekie was largely consumed at the Burns Centenary Festival at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, in 1859.
10136-8{_}1798{_}[Illustration: LEEKS.]
10136-8{_}1799{_}THE LEEK.--As in the case of the cucumber, this vegetable was     bewailed by the Israelites in their journey through the desert.
10136-8{_}1800{_}It is one of the alliaceous tribe, which consists of the onion,     garlic, chive, shallot, and leek.
10136-8{_}1801{_}These, as articles of food,     are perhaps more widely diffused over the face of the earth than     any other _genus_ of edible plants.
10136-8{_}1802{_}It is the national badge of     the Welsh, and tradition ascribes to St. David its introduction     to that part of Britain.
10136-8{_}1803{_}The origin of the wearing of the leek     on St. David's day, among that people, is thus given in     "BEETON'S DICTIONARY of UNIVERSAL INFORMATION:"--"It probably     originated from the custom of _Cymhortha_, or the friendly aid,     practised among farmers.
10136-8{_}1804{_}In some districts of South Wales, all     the neighbours of a small farmer were wont to appoint a day when     they attended to plough his land, and the like; and, at such     time, it was the custom for each to bring his portion of leeks     with him for making the broth or soup."
10136-8{_}1805{_}(_See_ ST.
10136-8{_}1806{_}DAVID.)
10136-8{_}1807{_}Others derive the origin of the custom from the battle of     Cressy.
10136-8{_}1808{_}The plant, when grown in Wales and Scotland, is sharper     than it is in England, and its flavour is preferred by many to     that of the onion in broth.
10136-8{_}1809{_}It is very wholesome, and, to     prevent its tainting the breath, should be well boiled.
10136-8{_}1810{_}MACARONI SOUP.

10136-8{_}1824{_}MACARONI.--This is the favourite food of Italy, where,     especially among the Neapolitans, it may be regarded as the     staff of life.
10136-8{_}1825{_}"The crowd of London," says Mr. Forsyth, "is a     double line in quick motion; it is the crowd of business.
10136-8{_}1826{_}The     crowd of Naples consists in a general tide rolling up and down,     and in the middle of this tide, a hundred eddies of men.
10136-8{_}1827{_}You are     stopped by a carpenter's bench, you are lost among shoemakers'     stalls, and you dash among the _pots of a macaroni stall_."
10136-8{_}1828{_}This     article of food is nothing more than a thick paste, made of the     best wheaten flour, with a small quantity of water.
10136-8{_}1829{_}When it has     been well worked, it is put into a hollow cylindrical vessel,     pierced with holes of the size of tobacco-pipes at the bottom.
10136-8{_}1830{_}Through these holes the mass is forced by a powerful screw     bearing on a piece of wood made exactly to fit the inside of the     cylinder.
10136-8{_}1831{_}Whilst issuing from the holes, it is partially baked     by a fire placed below the cylinder, and is, at the same time,     drawn away and hung over rods placed about the room, in order to     dry.
10136-8{_}1832{_}In a few days it is fit for use.
10136-8{_}1833{_}As it is both wholesome     and nutritious, it ought to be much more used by all classes in     England than it is.
10136-8{_}1834{_}It generally accompanies Parmesan cheese to     the tables of the rich, but is also used for thickening soups     and making puddings.

10136-8{_}1849{_}[Illustration: LETTUCE.]
10136-8{_}1850{_}THE LETTUCE.--This is one of the acetarious vegetables, which     comprise a large class, chiefly used as pickles, salads, and     other condiments.
10136-8{_}1851{_}The lettuce has in all antiquity been     distinguished as a kitchen-garden plant.
10136-8{_}1852{_}It was, without     preparation, eaten by the Hebrews with the Paschal lamb; the     Greeks delighted in it, and the Romans, in the time of Domitian,     had it prepared with eggs, and served in the first course at     their tables, merely to excite their appetites.
10136-8{_}1853{_}Its botanical     name is _Lactuca_, so called from the milky juice it exudes when     its stalks are cut.
10136-8{_}1854{_}It possesses a narcotic virtue, noticed by     ancient physicians; and even in our day a lettuce supper is     deemed conducive to repose.
10136-8{_}1855{_}Its proper character, however, is     that of a cooling summer vegetable, not very nutritive, but     serving as a corrective, or diluent of animal food.

10136-8{_}1892{_}THE ONION.--Like the cabbage, this plant was erected into an     object of worship by the idolatrous Egyptians 2,000 years before     the Christian era, and it still forms a favourite food in the     country of these people, as well as in other parts of Africa.
10136-8{_}1893{_}When it was first introduced to England, has not been     ascertained; but it has long been in use, and esteemed as a     favourite seasoning plant to various dishes.
10136-8{_}1894{_}In warmer climates     it is much milder in its flavour; and such as are grown in Spain     and Portugal, are, comparatively speaking, very large, and are     often eaten both in a boiled and roasted state.
10136-8{_}1895{_}The Strasburg is     the most esteemed; and, although all the species have highly     nutritive properties, they impart such a disagreeable odour to     the breath, that they are often rejected even where they are     liked.

10136-8{_}1928{_}It is also     to be found, generally distributed over Europe; and, in Catholic     countries, is mostly used with salt fish, in Lent.
10136-8{_}1929{_}In Scotland     it forms an excellent dish, when beat up with butter and     potatoes; it is, also, excellent when fried.
10136-8{_}1930{_}In Ireland it is     found to yield, in conjunction with the hop, a pleasant     beverage; and it contains as much spirit as the carrot, and     makes an excellent wine.
10136-8{_}1931{_}Its proportion of nutritive matter is     99 parts in 1,000; 9 being mucilage and 90 sugar.

10136-8{_}1961{_}[Illustration: PEA.]
10136-8{_}1962{_}THE PEA.--It is supposed that the common gray pea, found wild in     Greece, and other parts of the Levant, is the original of the     common garden pea, and of all the domestic varieties belonging     to it.
10136-8{_}1963{_}The gray, or field pea, called _bisallie_ by the French,     is less subject to run into varieties than the garden kinds, and     is considered by some, perhaps on that account, to be the wild     plant, retaining still a large proportion of its original habit.
10136-8{_}1964{_}From the tendency of all other varieties "to run away" and     become different to what they originally were, it is very     difficult to determine the races to which they belong.
10136-8{_}1965{_}The pea     was well known to the Romans, and, probably, was introduced to     Britain at an early period; for we find peas mentioned by     Lydgate, a poet of the 15th century, as being hawked in London.
10136-8{_}1966{_}They seem, however, for a considerable time, to have fallen out     of use; for, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Fuller tells us     they were brought from Holland, and were accounted "fit dainties     for ladies, they came so far and cost so dear."
10136-8{_}1967{_}There are some     varieties of peas which have no lining in their pods, which are     eaten cooked in the same way as kidney-beans.
10136-8{_}1968{_}They are called     _sugar_ peas, and the best variety is the large crooked sugar,     which is also very good, used in the common way, as a culinary     vegetable.
10136-8{_}1969{_}There is also a white sort, which readily splits when     subjected to the action of millstones set wide apart, so as not     to grind them.
10136-8{_}1970{_}These are used largely for soups, and especially     for sea-stores.
10136-8{_}1971{_}From the quantity of farinaceous and saccharine     matter contained in the pea, it is highly nutritious as an     article of food.

10136-8{_}2027{_}THE POTATO.--Humboldt doubted whether this root was a native of     South America; but it has been found growing wild both in Chili     and Buenos Ayres.
10136-8{_}2028{_}It was first brought to Spain from the     neighbourhood of Quito, in the early part of the sixteenth     century, first to England from Virginia, in 1586, and first     planted by Sir Walter Raleigh, on his estate of Youghal, near     Cork, in Ireland.
10136-8{_}2029{_}Thence it was brought and planted in     Lancashire, in England, and was, at first, recommended to be     eaten as a delicate dish, and not as common food.
10136-8{_}2030{_}This was in     1587.
10136-8{_}2031{_}_Nutritious Properties_.--Of a thousand parts of the     potato, Sir H. Davy found about a fourth nutritive; say, 200     mucilage or starch, 20 sugar, and 30 gluten.

10136-8{_}2043{_}THE PRINCE Of WALES.--This soup was invented by a philanthropic     friend of the Editress, to be distributed among the poor of a     considerable village, when the Prince of Wales attained his     majority, on the 9th November, 1859.
10136-8{_}2044{_}Accompanying this fact, the     following notice, which appears in "BEETON'S DICTIONARY OF     UNIVERSAL INFORMATION" may appropriately be introduced,     premising that British princes attain their majority in their     18th year, whilst mortals of ordinary rank do not arrive at that     period till their 21st.--"ALBERT EDWARD, Prince of Wales, and     heir to the British throne, merits a place in this work on     account of the high responsibilities which he is, in all     probability, destined to fulfil as sovereign of the British     empire.
10136-8{_}2045{_}On the 10th of November, 1858, he was gazetted as having     been invested with the rank of a colonel in the army.
10136-8{_}2046{_}Speaking     of this circumstance, the _Times_ said,--'The significance of     this event is, that it marks the period when the heir to the     British throne is about to take rank among men, and to enter     formally upon a career, which every loyal subject of the queen     will pray may be a long and a happy one, for his own sake and     for the sake of the vast empire which, in the course of nature,     he will one day be called to govern.
10136-8{_}2047{_}The best wish that we can     offer for the young prince is, that in his own path he may ever     keep before him the bright example of his royal mother, and show     himself worthy of her name.'
10136-8{_}2048{_}There are few in these realms who     will not give a fervent response to these sentiments.

10136-8{_}2077{_}[Illustration: EARS OF RICE.]
10136-8{_}2078{_}RICE.--This is a plant of Indian origin, and has formed the     principal food of the Indian and Chinese people from the most     remote antiquity.
10136-8{_}2079{_}Both Pliny and Dioscorides class it with the     cereals, though Galen places it among the vegetables.
10136-8{_}2080{_}Be this as     it may, however, it was imported to Greece, from India, about     286 years before Christ, and by the ancients it was esteemed     both nutritious and fattening.
10136-8{_}2081{_}There are three kinds of     rice,--the Hill rice, the Patna, and the Carolina, of the United     States.
10136-8{_}2082{_}Of these, only the two latter are imported to this     country, and the Carolina is considered the best, as it is the     dearest.
10136-8{_}2083{_}The nourishing properties of rice are greatly inferior     to those of wheat; but it is both a light and a wholesome food.
10136-8{_}2084{_}In combination with other foods, its nutritive qualities are     greatly increased; but from its having little stimulating power,     it is apt, when taken in large quantities alone, to lie long on     the stomach.

10136-8{_}2112{_}SAGO.--The farinaceous food of this name constitutes the pith of     the SAGO tree (the _Sagus farinifera_ of Linnaeus), which grows     spontaneously in the East Indies and in the archipelago of the     Indian Ocean.
10136-8{_}2113{_}There it forms the principal farinaceous diet of     the inhabitants.
10136-8{_}2114{_}In order to procure it, the tree is felled and     sawn in pieces.
10136-8{_}2115{_}The pith is then taken out, and put in     receptacles of cold water, where it is stirred until the flour     separates from the filaments, and sinks to the bottom, where it     is suffered to remain until the water is poured off, when it is     taken out and spread on wicker frames to dry.
10136-8{_}2116{_}To give it the     round granular form in which we find it come to this country, it     is passed through a colander, then rubbed into little balls, and     dried.
10136-8{_}2117{_}The tree is not fit for felling until it has attained a     growth of seven years, when a single trunk will yield 600 lbs.
10136-8{_}2118{_}weight; and, as an acre of ground will grow 430 of these trees,     a large return of flour is the result.
10136-8{_}2119{_}The best quality has a     slightly reddish hue, and easily dissolves to a jelly, in hot     water.

10136-8{_}2150{_}In sending the recipe for insertion in this work, he has, however, Anglicised, and somewhat, he thinks, improved it.

10136-8{_}2161{_}[Illustration: SPINACH.]
10136-8{_}2162{_}SPINACH.--This plant was unknown by the ancients, although it     was cultivated in the monastic gardens of the continent in the     middle of the 14th century.
10136-8{_}2163{_}Some say, that it was originally     brought from Spain; but there is a wild species growing in     England, and cultivated in Lincolnshire, in preference to the     other.
10136-8{_}2164{_}There are three varieties in use; the round-leaved, the     triangular-leaved, and Flanders spinach, known by its large     leaves.
10136-8{_}2165{_}They all form a useful ingredient in soup; but the     leaves are sometimes boiled alone, mashed, and eaten as greens.

10136-8{_}2180{_}TAPIOCA.--This excellent farinaceous food is the produce of the     pith of the cassava-tree, and is made in the East Indies, and     also in Brazil.
10136-8{_}2181{_}It is, by washing, procured as a starch from the     tree, then dried, either in the sun or on plates of hot iron,     and afterwards broken into grains, in which form it is imported     into this country.
10136-8{_}2182{_}Its nutritive properties are large, and as a     food for persons of delicate digestion, or for children, it is     in great estimation.
10136-8{_}2183{_}"No amylaceous substance," says Dr.     Christison, "is so much relished by infants about the time of     weaning; and in them it is less apt to become sour during     digestion than any other farinaceous food, even arrowroot not     excepted."

10136-8{_}2200{_}THE TURNIP.--Although turnips grow wild in England, they are not     the original of the cultivated vegetable made use of in this     country.
10136-8{_}2201{_}In ancient times they were grown for cattle by the     Romans, and in Germany and the Low Countries they have from time     immemorial been raised for the same purpose.
10136-8{_}2202{_}In their cultivated     state, they are generally supposed to have been introduced to     England from Hanover, in the time of George I.; but this has     been doubted, as George II.

10136-8{_}2204{_}As a culinary     vegetable, it is excellent, whether eaten alone, mashed, or     mixed with soups und stews.
10136-8{_}2205{_}Its nutritious matter, however, is     small, being only 42 parts in 1,000.

10136-8{_}2338{_}The cost, as will be seen, was not great; but she has reason to believe that the soup was very much liked, and gave to the members of those families, a dish of warm, comforting food, in place of the cold meat and piece of bread which form, with too many cottagers, their usual meal, when, with a little more knowledge of the "cooking."

10136-8{_}2405{_}It was known to the ancients; but was not introduced     to England till about the middle of the 16th century.
10136-8{_}2406{_}It is     consumed in large quantities by the French, and in London,--in     the neighbourhood of which it is grown in abundance;--it is     greatly used as a winter salad, as well as in soups and stews.

10136-8{_}2427{_}[Illustration: HARE.]
10136-8{_}2428{_}THE COMMON HARE.--This little animal is found throughout Europe,     and, indeed, in most of the northern parts of the world; and as     it is destitute of natural weapons of defence, Providence has     endowed it with an extraordinary amount of the passion of fear.
10136-8{_}2429{_}As if to awaken the vigilance of this passion, too, He has     furnished it with long and tubular ears, in order that it may     catch the remotest sounds; and with full, prominent eyes, which     enable it to see, at one and the same time, both before and     behind it.
10136-8{_}2430{_}The hare feeds in the evenings, and sleeps, in its     form, during the day; and, as it generally lies on the ground,     its feet, both below and above, are protected with a thick     covering of hair.
10136-8{_}2431{_}Its flesh, though esteemed by the Romans, was     forbidden by the Druids and by the earlier Britons.
10136-8{_}2432{_}It is now,     though very dark and dry, and devoid of fat, much esteemed by     Europeans, on account of the peculiarity of its flavour.
10136-8{_}2433{_}In     purchasing this animal, it ought to be remembered that both     hares and rabbits, when old, have their claws rugged and blunt,     their haunches thick, and their ears dry and tough.
10136-8{_}2434{_}The ears of     a young hare easily tear, and it has a narrow cleft in the lip;     whilst its claws are both smooth and sharp.
10136-8{_}2435{_}HESSIAN SOUP.
10136-8{_}2436{_}171.
10136-8{_}2437{_}INGREDIENTS.--Half an ox's head, 1 pint of split peas, 3 carrots, 6 turnips, 6 potatoes, 6 onions, 1 head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 2 blades of mace, a little allspice, 4 cloves, the crumb of a French roll, 6 quarts of water.
10136-8{_}2438{_}_Mode_.--Clean the head, rub it with salt and water, and soak it for 5 hours in warm water.
10136-8{_}2439{_}Simmer it in the water till tender, put it into a pan and let it cool; skim off all the fat; take out the head, and add the vegetables cut up small, and the peas which have been previously soaked; simmer them without the meat, till they are done enough to pulp through a sieve.

10136-8{_}2481{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}2482{_}_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.
10136-8{_}2483{_}THE CALF--The flesh of this animal is called veal, and when     young, that is, under two months old, yields a large quantity of     soluble extract, and is, therefore, much employed for soups and     broths.
10136-8{_}2484{_}The Essex farmers have obtained a celebrity for     fattening calves better than any others in England, where they     are plentifully supplied with milk, a thing impossible to be     done in the immediate neighbourhood of London.
10136-8{_}2485{_}MARJORAM.--There are several species of this plant; but that     which is preferred for cookery is a native of Portugal, and is     called sweet or knotted marjoram.
10136-8{_}2486{_}When its leaves are dried,     they have an agreeable aromatic flavour; and hence are used for     soups, stuffings, &c.
10136-8{_}2487{_}BASIL.--This is a native of the East Indies, and is highly     aromatic, having a perfume greatly resembling that of cloves.
10136-8{_}2488{_}It     is not much employed in English cookery, but is a favourite with     French cooks, by whom its leaves are used in soups and salads.
10136-8{_}2489{_}MULLAGATAWNY SOUP.

10136-8{_}2492{_}of pounded almonds, a little lemon-pickle, or mango-juice, to taste; 1 fowl or rabbit, 4 slices of lean bacon; 2 quarts of medium stock, or, if wanted very good, best stock.
10136-8{_}2493{_}_Mode_.-=Slice and fry the onions of a nice colour; line the stewpan with the bacon; cut up the rabbit or fowl into small joints, and slightly brown them; put in the fried onions, the garlic, and stock, and simmer gently till the meat is tender; skim very carefully, and when the meat is done, rub the curry powder to a smooth batter; add it to the soup with the almonds, which must be first pounded with a little of the stock.
10136-8{_}2494{_}Put in seasoning and lemon-pickle or mango-juice to taste, and serve boiled rice with it.

10136-8{_}2502{_}_Note_.--This soup can also be made with breast of veal, or calf's head.
10136-8{_}2503{_}Vegetable Mullagatawny is made with veal stock, by boiling and pulping chopped vegetable marrow, cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes, and seasoning with curry powder and cayenne.
10136-8{_}2504{_}Nice pieces of meat, good curry powder, and strong stock, are necessary to make this soup good.
10136-8{_}2505{_}[Illustration: CORIANDER.]
10136-8{_}2506{_}CORIANDER.--This plant, which largely enters into the     composition of curry powder with turmeric, originally comes from     the East; but it has long been cultivated in England, especially     in Essex, where it is reared for the use of confectioners and     druggists.
10136-8{_}2507{_}In private gardens, it is cultivated for the sake of     its tender leaves, which are highly aromatic, and are employed     in soups and salads.
10136-8{_}2508{_}Its seeds are used in large quantities for     the purposes of distillation.
10136-8{_}2509{_}A GOOD MUTTON SOUP.
10136-8{_}2510{_}175.
10136-8{_}2511{_}INGREDIENTS.--A neck of mutton about 5 or 6 lbs., 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 2 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley; salt and pepper to taste; a little sherry, if liked; 3 quarts of water.

10136-8{_}2513{_}The next day put the whole into a stewpan, and place it on a brisk fire.
10136-8{_}2514{_}When it commences to boil, take the pan off the fire, and put it on one side to simmer until the meat is done.
10136-8{_}2515{_}When ready for use, take out the meat, dish it up with carrots and turnips, and send it to table; strain the soup, let it cool, skim off all the fat, season and thicken it with a tablespoonful, or rather more, of arrowroot; flavour with a little sherry, simmer for 5 minutes, and serve.

10136-8{_}2522{_}THE SHEEP.--This animal formed the principal riches of the     patriarchs, in the days of old, and, no doubt, multiplied, until     its species were spread over the greater part of Western Asia;     but at what period it was introduced to Britain is not known.
10136-8{_}2523{_}It     is now found in almost every part of the globe, although, as a     domestic animal, it depends almost entirely upon man for its     support.
10136-8{_}2524{_}Its value, however, amply repays him for whatever care     and kindness he may bestow upon it; for, like the ox, there is     scarcely a part of it that he cannot convert to some useful     purpose.
10136-8{_}2525{_}The fleece, which serves it for a covering, is     appropriated by man, to serve the same end to himself, whilst     its skin is also applied to various purposes in civilized life.
10136-8{_}2526{_}Its entrails are used as strings for musical instruments, and     its bones are calcined, and employed as tests in the trade of     the refiner.
10136-8{_}2527{_}Its milk, being thicker than that of the cow,     yields a greater quantity of butter and cheese, and its flesh is     among the most wholesome and nutritive that can be eaten.
10136-8{_}2528{_}Thomson has beautifully described the appearance of the sheep,     when bound to undergo the operation of being shorn of its wool.
10136-8{_}2529{_}"Behold, where bound, and of its robe bereft       By needy man, that all-depending lord,       How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies!
10136-8{_}2530{_}What softness in his melancholy face,       What dumb complaining innocence appears!"
10136-8{_}2531{_}OX-CHEEK SOUP.
10136-8{_}2532{_}176.
10136-8{_}2533{_}INGREDIENTS.--An ox-cheek, 2 oz.

10136-8{_}2535{_}_Mode_.--Lay the ham in the bottom of the stewpan, with the butter; break the bones of the cheek, wash it clean, and put it on the ham.
10136-8{_}2536{_}Cut the vegetables small, add them to the other ingredients, and set the whole over a slow fire for 1/4 of an hour.
10136-8{_}2537{_}Now put in the water, and simmer gently till it is reduced to 4 quarts; take out the fleshy part of the cheek, and strain the soup into a clean stewpan; thicken with flour, put in a head of sliced celery, and simmer till the celery is tender.
10136-8{_}2538{_}If not a good colour, use a little browning.
10136-8{_}2539{_}Cut the meat into small square pieces, pour the soup over, and serve with the crust of a French roll in the tureen.
10136-8{_}2540{_}A glass of sherry much improves this soup.
10136-8{_}2541{_}_Time_.--3 to 4 hours.

10136-8{_}2545{_}_Sufficient_ for 12 persons.
10136-8{_}2546{_}THE OX.--Of the quadrupedal animals, the flesh of those that     feed upon herbs is the most wholesome and nutritious for human     food.
10136-8{_}2547{_}In the early ages, the ox was used as a religious     sacrifice, and, in the eyes of the Egyptians was deemed so     sacred as to be worthy of exaltation to represent Taurus, one of     the twelve signs of the zodiac.
10136-8{_}2548{_}To this day, the Hindoos     venerate the cow, whose flesh is forbidden to be eaten, and     whose fat, supposed to have been employed to grease the     cartridges of the Indian army, was one of the proximate causes     of the great Sepoy rebellion of 1857.
10136-8{_}2549{_}There are no animals of     greater use to man than the tribe to which the ox belongs.
10136-8{_}2550{_}There     is hardly a part of them that does not enter into some of the     arts and purposes of civilized life.
10136-8{_}2551{_}Of their horns are made     combs, knife-handles, boxes, spoons, and drinking-cups.
10136-8{_}2552{_}They are     also made into transparent plates for lanterns; an invention     ascribed, in England, to King Alfred.
10136-8{_}2553{_}Glue is made from their     gristles, cartilages, and portions of their hides.
10136-8{_}2554{_}Their bones     often form a substitute for ivory; their skins, when calves, are     manufactured into vellum; their blood is the basis of Prussian     blue; their sinews furnish fine and strong threads, used by     saddlers; their hair enters into various manufactures; their     tallow is made into candles; their flesh is eaten, and the     utility of the milk and cream of the cow is well known.
10136-8{_}2555{_}OX-TAIL SOUP.

10136-8{_}2591{_}THE PARTRIDGE.--This is a timorous bird, being easily taken.
10136-8{_}2592{_}It     became known to the Greeks and Romans, whose tables it helped to     furnish with food.
10136-8{_}2593{_}Formerly, the Red was scarce in Italy, but     its place was supplied by the White, which, at considerable     expense, was frequently procured from the Alps.
10136-8{_}2594{_}The Athenians     trained this bird for fighting, and Severus used to lighten the     cares of royalty by witnessing the spirit of its combats.
10136-8{_}2595{_}The     Greeks esteemed its leg most highly, and rejected the other     portions as unfashionable to be eaten.
10136-8{_}2596{_}The Romans, however,     ventured a little further, and ate the breast, whilst we     consider the bird as wholly palatable.
10136-8{_}2597{_}It is an inhabitant of     all the temperate countries of Europe, but, on account of the     geniality of the climate, it abounds most in the Ukraine.

10136-8{_}2615{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 knuckles of veal, 3 shins of beef, 1 large faggot of herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 heads of celery, 3 onions, 3 carrots, 2 blades of mace, 6 cloves, a teaspoonful of salt, sufficient water to cover all the ingredients.
10136-8{_}2616{_}_Mode_.--Take the marrow from the bones; put all the ingredients in a stock-pot, and simmer slowly for 12 hours, or more, if the meat be not done to rags; strain it off, and put it in a very cool place; take off all the fat, reduce the liquor in a shallow pan, by setting it over a sharp fire, but be particular that it does not burn; boil it fast and uncovered for 8 hours, and keep it stirred.
10136-8{_}2617{_}Put it into a deep dish, and set it by for a day.
10136-8{_}2618{_}Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, place the dish in it, and keep it boiling; stir occasionally, and when the soup is thick and ropy, it is done.
10136-8{_}2619{_}Form it into little cakes by pouring a small quantity on to the bottom of cups or basins; when cold, turn them out on a flannel to dry.
10136-8{_}2620{_}Keep them from the air in tin canisters.
10136-8{_}2621{_}_Average cost_ of this quantity, 16s.
10136-8{_}2622{_}_Note_.--Soup can be made in 5 minutes with this, by dissolving a small piece, about the size of a walnut, in a pint of warm water, and simmering for 2 minutes.
10136-8{_}2623{_}Vermicelli, macaroni, or other Italian pastes, may be added.
10136-8{_}2624{_}THE LAUREL or BAY.--The leaves of this tree frequently enter     into the recipes of cookery; but they ought not to be used     without the greatest caution, and not at all unless the cook is     perfectly aware of their effects.
10136-8{_}2625{_}It ought to be known, that     there are two kinds of bay-trees,--the Classic laurel, whose     leaves are comparatively harmless, and the Cherry-laurel, which     is the one whose leaves are employed in cookery.
10136-8{_}2626{_}They have a     kernel-like flavour, and are used in blanc-mange, puddings,     custards &c.; but when acted upon by water, they develop prussic     acid, and, therefore, but a small number of the leaves should be     used at a time.
10136-8{_}2627{_}RABBIT SOUP.
10136-8{_}2628{_}181.

10136-8{_}2632{_}Simmer slowly till done through, and add the 3 quarts of water, and boil for an hour.
10136-8{_}2633{_}Take out the rabbet, pick the meat from the bones, covering it up to keep it white; put the bones back in the liquor, add the vegetables, and simmer for 2 hours; skim and strain, and let it cool.
10136-8{_}2634{_}Now pound the meat in a mortar, with the yolks of the eggs, and the crumb of the roll previously soaked; rub it through a tammy, and gradually add it to the strained liquor, and simmer for 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}2635{_}Mix arrowroot or rice-flour with the cream (say 2 dessert-spoonfuls), and stir in the soup; bring it to a boil, and serve.
10136-8{_}2636{_}This soup must be very white, and instead of thickening it with arrowroot or rice-flour, vermicelli or pearl barley can be boiled in a little stock, and put in 5 minutes before serving.

10136-8{_}2743{_}THE TURKEY.--The common turkey is a native of North America, and     was thence introduced to England, in the reign of Henry VIII.
10136-8{_}2744{_}According to Tusser's "Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry,"     about the year 1585 it begun to form a dish at our rural     Christmas feasts.
10136-8{_}2745{_}"Beef, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best,       Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well dress'd,       Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear,       As then in the country is counted good cheer."
10136-8{_}2746{_}It is one of the most difficult birds to rear, of any that we     have; yet, in its wild state, is found in great abundance in the     forests of Canada, where, it might have been imagined that the     severity of the climate would be unfavourable to its ever     becoming plentiful.
10136-8{_}2747{_}They are very fond of the seeds of nettles,     and the seeds of the foxglove poison them.
10136-8{_}2748{_}TURTLE SOUP (founded on M. Ude's Recipe).
10136-8{_}2749{_}189.
10136-8{_}2750{_}INGREDIENTS.--A turtle, 6 slices of ham, 2 knuckles of veal, 1 large bunch of sweet herbs, 3 bay-leaves, parsley, green onions, 1 onion, 6 cloves, 4 blades of mace, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}2751{_}of fresh butter, 1 bottle of Madeira, 1 lump of sugar.
10136-8{_}2752{_}For the _Quenelles à Tortue_, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}2753{_}of veal, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}2754{_}of bread crumbs, milk, 7 eggs, cayenne, salt, spices, chopped parsley, the juice of 2 lemons.
10136-8{_}2755{_}_Mode_.--To make this soup with less difficulty, cut off the head of the turtle the preceding day.
10136-8{_}2756{_}In the morning open the turtle by leaning heavily with a knife on the shell of the animal's back, whilst you cut this off all round.
10136-8{_}2757{_}Turn it upright on its end, that all the water, &c. may run out, when the flesh should be cut off along the spine, with the knife sloping towards the bones, for fear of touching the gall, which sometimes might escape the eye.
10136-8{_}2758{_}When all the flesh about the members is obtained, wash these clean, and let them drain.
10136-8{_}2759{_}Have ready, on the fire, a large vessel full of boiling water, into which put the shells; and when you perceive that they come easily off, take them out of the water, and prick them all, with those of the back, belly, fins, head, &c. Boil the back and belly till the bones can be taken off, without, however, allowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done, as they will be boiled again in the soup.
10136-8{_}2760{_}When these latter come off easily, lay them on earthen dishes singly, for fear they should stick together, and put them to cool.
10136-8{_}2761{_}Keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts, and let the bones stew thoroughly in it, as this liquor must be used to moisten all the sauces.
10136-8{_}2762{_}All the flesh of the interior parts, the four legs and head, must be drawn down in the following manner:--Lay the slices of ham on the bottom of a very large stewpan, over them the knuckles of veal, according to the size of the turtle; then the inside flesh of the turtle, and over the whole the members.
10136-8{_}2763{_}Now moisten with the water in which you are boiling the shell, and draw it down thoroughly.
10136-8{_}2764{_}It may now be ascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the fleshy part of the meat.
10136-8{_}2765{_}If no blood appears, it is time to moisten it again with the liquor in which the bones, &c. have been boiling.
10136-8{_}2766{_}Put in a large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a turtle,--sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, common thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a large onion stuck with 6 cloves.
10136-8{_}2767{_}Let the whole be thoroughly done.
10136-8{_}2768{_}With respect to the members, probe them, to see whether they are done, and if so, drain and send them to the larder, as they are to make their appearance only when the soup is absolutely completed.
10136-8{_}2769{_}When the flesh is also completely done, strain it through a silk sieve, and make a very thin white _roux;_ for turtle soup must not be much thickened.
10136-8{_}2770{_}When the flour is sufficiently done on a slow fire, and has a good colour, moisten it with the liquor, keeping it over the fire till it boils.
10136-8{_}2771{_}Ascertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin; then draw the stewpan on the side of the stove, to skim off the white scum, and all the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce.
10136-8{_}2772{_}By this time all the softer parts will be sufficiently cold; when they must be cut to about the size of one or two inches square, and thrown into the soup, which must now be left to simmer gently.
10136-8{_}2773{_}When done, skim off all the fat and froth.
10136-8{_}2774{_}Take all the leaves of the herbs from the stock,--sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, common thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a large onion cut in four pieces, with a few blades of mace.
10136-8{_}2775{_}Put these in a stewpan, with about 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}2776{_}of fresh butter, and let it simmer on a slow fire till quite melted, when pour in 1 bottle of good Madeira, adding a small bit of sugar, and let it boil gently for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}2777{_}When done, rub it through a tammy, and add it to the soup.
10136-8{_}2778{_}Let this boil, till no white scum rises; then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the sauce, and put them in a clean stewpan: when you have all out, pour the soup over the bits of turtle, through a tammy, and proceed as follows:--  QUENELLES À TORTUE.--Make some _quenelles à tortue_, which being substitutes for eggs, do not require to be very delicate.
10136-8{_}2779{_}Take out the fleshy part of a leg of veal, about 1 lb., scrape off all the meat, without leaving any sinews or fat, and soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread.
10136-8{_}2780{_}When the bread is well soaked, squeeze it, and put it into a mortar, with the veal, a small quantity of calf's udder, a little butter, the yolks of 4 eggs, boiled hard, a little cayenne pepper, salt, and spices, and pound the whole very fine; then thicken the mixture with 2 whole eggs, and the yolk of another.
10136-8{_}2781{_}Next try this _farce_ or stuffing in boiling-hot water, to ascertain its consistency: if it is too thin, add the yolk of an egg.
10136-8{_}2782{_}When the _farce_ is perfected, take half of it, and put into it some chopped parsley.
10136-8{_}2783{_}Let the whole cool, in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg; poach it in salt and boiling water, and when very hard, drain on a sieve, and put it into the turtle.
10136-8{_}2784{_}Before you send up, squeeze the juice of 2 or 3 lemons, with a little cayenne pepper, and pour that into the soup.
10136-8{_}2785{_}THE FINS may be served as a _plat d'entrée_ with a little turtle sauce; if not, on the following day you may warm the turtle _au bain marie_, and serve the members entire, with a _matelote_ sauce, garnished with mushrooms, cocks' combs, _quenelles_, &c. When either lemon-juice or cayenne pepper has been introduced, no boiling must take place.
10136-8{_}2786{_}_Note_.--It is necessary to observe, that the turtle prepared a day before it is used, is generally preferable, the flavour being more uniform.
10136-8{_}2787{_}Be particular, when you dress a very large turtle, to preserve the green fat (be cautious not to study a very brown colour,--the natural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true connoisseur) in a separate stewpan, and likewise when the turtle is entirely done, to have as many tureens as you mean to serve each time.
10136-8{_}2788{_}You cannot put the whole in a large vessel, for many reasons: first, it will be long in cooling; secondly, when you take some out, it will break all the rest into rags.
10136-8{_}2789{_}If you warm in a _bain marie_, the turtle will always retain the same taste; but if you boil it often, it becomes strong, and loses the delicacy of its flavour.
10136-8{_}2790{_}THE COST OF TURTLE SOUP.--This is the most expensive soup brought to table.
10136-8{_}2791{_}It is sold by the quart,--one guinea being the standard price for that quantity.
10136-8{_}2792{_}The price of live turtle ranges from 8d.
10136-8{_}2793{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}2794{_}per lb., according to supply and demand.
10136-8{_}2795{_}When live turtle is dear, many cooks use the tinned turtle, which is killed when caught, and preserved by being put in hermetically-sealed canisters, and so sent over to England.
10136-8{_}2796{_}The cost of a tin, containing 2 quarts, or 4 lbs., is about £2, and for a small one, containing the green fat, 7s.
10136-8{_}2797{_}6d.
10136-8{_}2798{_}From these about 6 quarts of good soup may be made.
10136-8{_}2799{_}[Illustration: THE TURTLE.]
10136-8{_}2800{_}THE GREEN TURTLE.--This reptile is found in large numbers on the     coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics, in     both the old and new worlds.
10136-8{_}2801{_}Their length is often five feet and     upwards, and they range in weight from 50 to 500 or 600 lbs.
10136-8{_}2802{_}As     turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they     frequent, they are not of a quarrelsome disposition, as the     submarine meadows in which they pasture, yield plenty for them     all.
10136-8{_}2803{_}Like other species of amphibia, too, they have the power of     living many months without food; so that they live harmlessly     and peaceably together, notwithstanding that they seem to have     no common bond of association, but merely assemble in the same     places as if entirely by accident.
10136-8{_}2804{_}England is mostly supplied     with them from the West Indies, whence they are brought alive     and in tolerable health.
10136-8{_}2805{_}The green turtle is highly prized on     account of the delicious quality of its flesh, the fat of the     upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest     and most delicate parts.
10136-8{_}2806{_}The soup, however, is apt to disagree     with weak stomachs.
10136-8{_}2807{_}As an article of luxury, the turtle has only     come into fashion within the last 100 years, and some hundreds     of tureens of turtle soup are served annually at the lord     mayor's dinner in Guildhall.

10136-8{_}2833{_}TABLE BEER.--This is nothing more than a weak ale, and is not     made so much with a view to strength, as to transparency of     colour and an agreeable bitterness of taste.
10136-8{_}2834{_}It is, or ought to     be, manufactured by the London professional brewers, from the     best pale malt, or amber and malt.

10136-8{_}2870{_}The Greeks preferred it when brought     from Alexandria, and the Romans ate it boiled with cumin, and     seasoned with pepper and other condiments.
10136-8{_}2871{_}A recipe tells us,     that crayfish can be preserved several days in baskets with     fresh grass, such as the nettle, or in a bucket with about     three-eighths of an inch of water.

10136-8{_}2930{_}SEASON OF OYSTERS.--From April and May to the end of July,     oysters are said to be sick; but by the end of August they     become healthy, having recovered from the effects of spawning.
10136-8{_}2931{_}When they are not in season, the males have a black, and the     females a milky substance in the gill.
10136-8{_}2932{_}From some lines of     Oppian, it would appear that the ancients were ignorant that the     oyster is generally found adhering to rocks.
10136-8{_}2933{_}The starfish is one     of the most deadly enemies of these bivalves.
10136-8{_}2934{_}The poet says:--        The prickly star creeps on with full deceit       To force the oyster from his close retreat.

10136-8{_}2956{_}CHAPTER VII.
10136-8{_}2957{_}THE NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES.
10136-8{_}2958{_}199.
10136-8{_}2959{_}IN NATURAL HISTORY, FISHES form the fourth class in the system of Linnaeus, and are described as having long under-jaws, eggs without white, organs of sense, fins for supporters, bodies covered with concave scales, gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration, and water for the natural element of their existence.
10136-8{_}2960{_}Had mankind no other knowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their own atmosphere, they would listen with incredulous wonder, if told that there were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters, and which would die almost as soon as they were taken from them.
10136-8{_}2961{_}However strongly these facts might be attested, they would hardly believe them, without the operation of their own senses, as they would recollect the effect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water, and the impossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period of time.
10136-8{_}2962{_}Experience, however, has taught them, that the "great deep" is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes, and of vastly different constructions, with modes of life entirely distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land, and with peculiarities of design, equally wonderful with those of any other works which have come from the hand of the Creator.
10136-8{_}2963{_}The history of these races, however, must remain for ever, more or less, in a state of darkness, since the depths in which they live, are beyond the power of human exploration, and since the illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely out of the reach of human accessibility.
10136-8{_}2964{_}200.
10136-8{_}2965{_}IN STUDYING THE CONFORMATION OF FISHES, we naturally conclude that they are, in every respect, well adapted to the element in which they have their existence.
10136-8{_}2966{_}Their shape has a striking resemblance to the lower part of a ship; and there is no doubt that the form of the fish originally suggested the form of the ship.
10136-8{_}2967{_}The body is in general slender, gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities, and flattened on each of its sides.
10136-8{_}2968{_}This is precisely the form of the lower part of the hull of a ship; and it enables both the animal and the vessel, with comparative ease, to penetrate and divide the resisting medium for which they have been adapted.
10136-8{_}2969{_}The velocity of a ship, however, in sailing before the wind, is by no means to be compared to that of a fish.
10136-8{_}2970{_}It is well known that the largest fishes will, with the greatest ease, overtake a ship in full sail, play round it without effort, and shoot ahead of it at pleasure.
10136-8{_}2971{_}This arises from their great flexibility, which, to compete with mocks the labours of art, and enables them to migrate thousands of miles in a season, without the slightest indications of languor or fatigue.
10136-8{_}2972{_}201.
10136-8{_}2973{_}THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED BY FISHES to accelerate their motion, are their air-bladder, fins, and tail.
10136-8{_}2974{_}By means of the air-bladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their bodies.
10136-8{_}2975{_}When they wish to sink, they compress the muscles of the abdomen, and eject the air contained in it; by which, their weight, compared with that of the water, is increased, and they consequently descend.
10136-8{_}2976{_}On the other hand, when they wish to rise, they relax the compression of the abdominal muscles, when the air-bladder fills and distends, and the body immediately ascends to the surface.
10136-8{_}2977{_}How simply, yet how wonderfully, has the Supreme Being adapted certain means to the attainment of certain ends!
10136-8{_}2978{_}Those fishes which are destitute of the air-bladder are heavy in the water, and have no great "alacrity" in rising.
10136-8{_}2979{_}The larger proportion of them remain at the bottom, unless they are so formed as to be able to strike their native element downwards with sufficient force to enable them to ascend.
10136-8{_}2980{_}When the air-bladder of a fish is burst, its power of ascending to the surface has for ever passed away.
10136-8{_}2981{_}From a knowledge of this fact, the fishermen of cod are enabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their well-boats.
10136-8{_}2982{_}The means they adopt to accomplish this, is to perforate the sound, or air-bladder, with a needle, which disengages the air, when the fishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well, into which they are thrown.
10136-8{_}2983{_}Without this operation, it would be impossible to keep the cod under water whilst they had life.
10136-8{_}2984{_}In swimming, the _fins_ enable fishes to preserve their upright position, especially those of the belly, which act like two feet.
10136-8{_}2985{_}Without those, they would swim with their bellies upward, as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity lies.
10136-8{_}2986{_}In ascending and descending, these are likewise of great assistance, as they contract and expand accordingly.
10136-8{_}2987{_}The _tail_ is an instrument of great muscular force, and largely assists the fish in all its motions.
10136-8{_}2988{_}In some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship, and enables it to turn sideways; and when moved from side to side with a quick vibratory motion, fishes are made, in the same manner as the "screw" propeller makes a steamship, to dart forward with a celerity proportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed.
10136-8{_}2989{_}202.
10136-8{_}2990{_}THE BODIES OF FISHES are mostly covered with a kind of horny scales; but some are almost entirely without them, or have them so minute as to be almost invisible; as is the case with the eel.
10136-8{_}2991{_}The object of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the water, or the sudden contact with pebbles, rocks, or sea-weeds.
10136-8{_}2992{_}Others, again, are enveloped in a fatty, oleaginous substance, also intended as a defence against the friction of the water; and those in which the scales are small, are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter.
10136-8{_}2993{_}203.
10136-8{_}2994{_}THE RESPIRATION OF FISHES is effected by means of those comb-like organs which are placed on each side of the neck, and which are called gills.
10136-8{_}2995{_}It is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is performed by the finny tribes.
10136-8{_}2996{_}It seems to be so continuous, that it might almost pass for an illustration of the vexed problem which conceals the secret of perpetual motion.
10136-8{_}2997{_}In performing it, they fill their mouths with water, which they drive backwards with a force so great as to open the large flap, to allow it to escape behind.
10136-8{_}2998{_}In this operation all, or a great portion, of the air contained in the water, is left among the feather-like processes of the gills, and is carried into the body, there to perform its part in the animal economy.
10136-8{_}2999{_}In proof of this, it has been ascertained that, if the water in which fishes are put, is, by any means, denuded of its air, they immediately seek the surface, and begin to gasp for it.
10136-8{_}3000{_}Hence, distilled water is to them what a vacuum made by an air-pump, is to most other animals.
10136-8{_}3001{_}For this reason, when a fishpond, or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are kept, is entirely frozen over, it is necessary to make holes in the ice, not so especially for the purpose of feeding them, as for that of giving them air to breathe.
10136-8{_}3002{_}204.
10136-8{_}3003{_}THE POSITIONS OF THE TEETH OF FISHES are well calculated to excite our amazement; for, in some cases, these are situated in the jaws, sometimes on the tongue or palate, and sometimes even in the throat.
10136-8{_}3004{_}They are in general sharp-pointed and immovable; but in the carp they are obtuse, and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper hold than such as the mere skin can afford.
10136-8{_}3005{_}In the herring, the tongue is set with teeth, to enable it the better, it is supposed, to retain its food.
10136-8{_}3006{_}205.
10136-8{_}3007{_}ALTHOUGH NATURALISTS HAVE DIVIDED FISHES into two great tribes, the _osseous_ and the _cartilaginous_, yet the distinction is not very precise; for the first have a great deal of cartilage, and the second, at any rate, a portion of calcareous matter in their bones.
10136-8{_}3008{_}It may, therefore, be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate substance between true bones and cartilages.
10136-8{_}3009{_}The backbone extends through the whole length of the body, and consists of vertebrae, strong and thick towards the head, but weaker and more slender as it approaches the tail.
10136-8{_}3010{_}Each species has a determinate number of vertebrae, which are increased in size in proportion with the body.
10136-8{_}3011{_}The ribs are attached to the processes of the vertebrae, and inclose the breast and abdomen.
10136-8{_}3012{_}Some kinds, as the rays, have no ribs; whilst others, as the sturgeon and eel, have very short ones.
10136-8{_}3013{_}Between the pointed processes of the vertebrae are situated the bones which support the dorsal (back) and the anal (below the tail) fins, which are connected with the processes by a ligament.
10136-8{_}3014{_}At the breast are the sternum or breastbone, clavicles or collar-bones, and the scapulae or shoulder-blades, on which the pectoral or breast fins are placed.
10136-8{_}3015{_}The bones which support the ventral or belly fins are called the _ossa pelvis_.
10136-8{_}3016{_}Besides these principal bones, there are often other smaller ones, placed between the muscles to assist their motion.
10136-8{_}3017{_}206.
10136-8{_}3018{_}SOME OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE IN FISHES are supposed to be possessed by them in a high degree, and others much more imperfectly.
10136-8{_}3019{_}Of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste, which are believed to be very slightly developed.
10136-8{_}3020{_}On the other hand, those of hearing, seeing, and smelling, are ascertained to be acute, but the first in a lesser degree than both the second and third.
10136-8{_}3021{_}Their possession of an auditory organ was long doubted, and even denied by some physiologists; but it has been found placed on the sides of the skull, or in the cavity which contains the brain.
10136-8{_}3022{_}It occupies a position entirely distinct and detached from the skull, and, in this respect, differs in the local disposition of the same sense in birds and quadrupeds.
10136-8{_}3023{_}In some fishes, as in those of the ray kind, the organ is wholly encompassed by those parts which contain the cavity of the skull; whilst in the cod and salmon kind it is in the part within the skull.
10136-8{_}3024{_}Its structure is, in every way, much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals which live entirely in the air; but there is no doubt that they have the adaptation suitable to their condition.
10136-8{_}3025{_}In some genera, as in the rays, the external orifice or ear is very small, and is placed in the upper surface of the head; whilst in others there is no visible external orifice whatever.
10136-8{_}3026{_}However perfect the _sight_ of fishes may be, experience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than that of smelling, in searching for their food.
10136-8{_}3027{_}The optic nerves in fishes have this peculiarity,--that they are not confounded with one another in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit.
10136-8{_}3028{_}The one passes over the other without any communication; so that the nerve which comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye, and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the left.
10136-8{_}3029{_}In the greater part of them, the eye is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head.
10136-8{_}3030{_}The object of this arrangement, perhaps, is to defend it from the action of the water, as there are no eyelids.
10136-8{_}3031{_}The globe in front is somewhat depressed, and is furnished behind with a muscle, which serves to lengthen or flatten it, according to the necessities of the animal.
10136-8{_}3032{_}The crystalline humour, which in quadrupeds is flattened, is, in fishes, nearly globular.
10136-8{_}3033{_}The organ of _smelling_ in fishes is large, and is endued, at its entry, with a dilating and contracting power, which is employed as the wants of the animal may require.
10136-8{_}3034{_}It is mostly by the acuteness of their smell that fishes are enabled to discover their food; for their tongue is not designed for nice sensation, being of too firm a cartilaginous substance for this purpose.
10136-8{_}3035{_}207.
10136-8{_}3036{_}WITH RESPECT TO THE FOOD OF FISHES, this is almost universally found in their own element.
10136-8{_}3037{_}They are mostly carnivorous, though they seize upon almost anything that comes in their way: they even devour their own offspring, and manifest a particular predilection for all living creatures.
10136-8{_}3038{_}Those, to which Nature has meted out mouths of the greatest capacity, would seem to pursue everything with life, and frequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey.
10136-8{_}3039{_}The animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor; and he has no sooner conquered his foe than he devours him.
10136-8{_}3040{_}Innumerable shoals of one species pursue those of another, with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the equator, through all the varying temperatures and depths of their boundless domain.
10136-8{_}3041{_}In these pursuits a scene of universal violence is the result; and many species must have become extinct, had not Nature accurately proportioned the means of escape, the production, and the numbers, to the extent and variety of the danger to which they are exposed.
10136-8{_}3042{_}Hence the smaller species are not only more numerous, but more productive than the larger; whilst their instinct leads them in search of food and safety near the shores, where, from the shallowness of the waters, many of their foes are unable to follow them.
10136-8{_}3043{_}208.
10136-8{_}3044{_}THE FECUNDITY OF FISHES has been the wonder of every natural philosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject.
10136-8{_}3045{_}They are in general oviparous, or egg-producing; but there are a few, such as the eel and the blenny, which are viviparous, or produce their young alive.
10136-8{_}3046{_}The males have the _milt_ and the females the _roe_; but some individuals, as the sturgeon and the cod tribes, are said to contain both.
10136-8{_}3047{_}The greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel; but some of those which dwell in the depths of the ocean attach their eggs to sea-weeds.
10136-8{_}3048{_}In every instance, however, their fruitfulness far surpasses that of any other race of animals.
10136-8{_}3049{_}According to Lewenhoeck, the cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of eggs, contained in a single roe.
10136-8{_}3050{_}The flounder produces one million; the mackerel above five hundred thousand; a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand; a carp fourteen inches in length, according to Petit, contained two hundred and sixty-two thousand two hundred and twenty-four; a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty; and a female sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fifty-three thousand two hundred.
10136-8{_}3051{_}The viviparous species are by no means so prolific; yet the blenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time, which commence sporting together round their parent the moment they have come into existence.
10136-8{_}3052{_}209.
10136-8{_}3053{_}IN REFERENCE TO THE LONGEVITY OF FISHES, it is affirmed to surpass that of all other created beings; and it is supposed they are, to a great extent, exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other animals is heir.
10136-8{_}3054{_}In place of suffering from the rigidity of age, which is the cause of the natural decay of those that "live and move and have their being" on the land, their bodies continue to grow with each succeeding supply of food, and the conduits of life to perform their functions unimpaired.
10136-8{_}3055{_}The age of fishes has not been properly ascertained, although it is believed that the most minute of the species has a longer lease of life than man.
10136-8{_}3056{_}The mode in which they die has been noted by the Rev.
10136-8{_}3057{_}Mr. White, the eminent naturalist of Selbourne.
10136-8{_}3058{_}As soon as the fish sickens, the head sinks lower and lower, till the animal, as it were, stands upon it.
10136-8{_}3059{_}After this, as it becomes weaker, it loses its poise, till the tail turns over, when it comes to the surface, and floats with its belly upwards.
10136-8{_}3060{_}The reason for its floating in this manner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of the belly, and the broad muscular back preponderating, by its own gravity, over the belly, from this latter being a cavity, and consequently lighter.
10136-8{_}3061{_}210.
10136-8{_}3062{_}FISHES ARE EITHER SOLITARY OR GREGARIOUS, and some of them migrate to great distances, and into certain rivers, to deposit their spawn.
10136-8{_}3063{_}Of sea-fishes, the cod, herring, mackerel, and many others, assemble in immense shoals, and migrate through different tracts of the ocean; but, whether considered in their solitary or gregarious capacity, they are alike wonderful to all who look through Nature up to Nature's God, and consider, with due humility, yet exalted admiration, the sublime variety, beauty, power, and grandeur of His productions, as manifested in the Creation.
10136-8{_}3064{_}FISH AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD.
10136-8{_}3065{_}211.
10136-8{_}3066{_}AS THE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF FISH are deemed inferior to those of what is called butchers' meat, it would appear, from all we can learn, that, in all ages, it has held only a secondary place in the estimation of those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large element in the happiness of mankind.
10136-8{_}3067{_}Among the Jews of old it was very little used, although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted, as Moses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor fins.
10136-8{_}3068{_}The Egyptians, however, made fish an article of diet, notwithstanding that it was rejected by their priests.
10136-8{_}3069{_}Egypt, however, is not a country favourable to the production of fish, although we read of the people, when hungry, eating it raw; of epicures among them having dried it in the sun; and of its being salted and preserved, to serve as a repast on days of great solemnity.
10136-8{_}3070{_}The modern Egyptians are, in general, extremely temperate in     regard to food.
10136-8{_}3071{_}Even the richest among them take little pride,     and, perhaps, experience as little delight, in the luxuries of     the table.
10136-8{_}3072{_}Their dishes mostly consist of pilaus, soups, and     stews, prepared principally of onions, cucumbers, and other cold     vegetables, mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces.
10136-8{_}3073{_}On     special occasions, however, a whole sheep is placed on the     festive board; but during several of the hottest months of the     year, the richest restrict themselves entirely to a vegetable     diet.
10136-8{_}3074{_}The poor are contented with a little oil or sour milk, in     which they may dip their bread.
10136-8{_}3075{_}212.
10136-8{_}3076{_}PASSING FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE, we come amongst a people who have, almost from time immemorial, occupied a high place in the estimation of every civilized country; yet the Greeks, in their earlier ages, made very little use of fish as an article of diet.
10136-8{_}3077{_}In the eyes of the heroes of Homer it had little favour; for Menelaus complained that "hunger pressed their digestive organs," and they had been obliged to live upon fish.
10136-8{_}3078{_}Subsequently, however, fish became one of the principal articles of diet amongst the Hellenes; and both Aristophanes and Athenaeus allude to it, and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality to the turbot and mullet.
10136-8{_}3079{_}So infatuated were many of the Greek gastronomes with the love     of fish, that some of them would have preferred death from     indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with     which a few of the species supplied them.
10136-8{_}3080{_}Philoxenes of Cythera     was one of these.
10136-8{_}3081{_}On being informed by his physician that he was     going to die of indigestion, on account of the quantity he was     consuming of a delicious fish, "Be it so," he calmly observed;     "but before I die, let me finish the remainder."
10136-8{_}3082{_}213.
10136-8{_}3083{_}THE GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION OF GREECE was highly favourable for the development of a taste for the piscatory tribes; and the skill of the Greek cooks was so great, that they could impart every variety of relish to the dish they were called upon to prepare.
10136-8{_}3084{_}Athenaeus has transmitted to posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in seasoning with salt, oil, and aromatics.
10136-8{_}3085{_}At the present day the food of the Greeks, through the combined     influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion     imposes upon them, is, to a large extent, composed of fish,     accompanied with vegetables and fruit.
10136-8{_}3086{_}Caviare, prepared from     the roes of sturgeons, is the national ragout, which, like all     other fish dishes, they season with aromatic herbs.
10136-8{_}3087{_}Snails     dressed in garlic are also a favourite dish.
10136-8{_}3088{_}214.
10136-8{_}3089{_}AS THE ROMANS, in a great measure, took their taste in the fine arts from the Greeks, so did they, in some measure, their piscine appetites.
10136-8{_}3090{_}The eel-pout and the lotas's liver were the favourite fish dishes of the Roman epicures; whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one of the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table.
10136-8{_}3091{_}With all the elegance, taste, and refinement of Roman luxury, it     was sometimes promoted or accompanied by acts of great     barbarity.
10136-8{_}3092{_}In proof of this, the mention of the red mullet     suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the, to     us, _horrible_ entertainment of the _fashionable_ in Roman     circles.
10136-8{_}3093{_}It may be premised, that as England has, Rome, in her     palmy days, had, her fops, who had, no doubt, through the medium     of their cooks, discovered that when the scales of the red     mullet were removed, the flesh presented a fine pink-colour.
10136-8{_}3094{_}Having discovered this, it was further observed that at the     death of the animal, this colour passed through a succession of     beautiful shades, and, in order that these might be witnessed     and enjoyed in their fullest perfection, the poor mullet was     served alive in a glass vessel.
10136-8{_}3095{_}215.
10136-8{_}3096{_}THE LOVE OF FISH among the ancient Romans rose to a real mania.
10136-8{_}3097{_}Apicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine compounded of the liver of red mullets; and Lucullus had a canal cut through a mountain, in the neighbourhood of Naples, that fish might be the more easily transported to the gardens of his villa.
10136-8{_}3098{_}Hortensius, the orator, wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own hands; and the daughter of Druses adorned one that she had, with rings of gold.
10136-8{_}3099{_}These were, surely, instances of misplaced affection; but there is no accounting for tastes.
10136-8{_}3100{_}It was but the other day that we read in the "_Times_" of a wealthy _living_ English hermit, who delights in the companionship of rats!
10136-8{_}3101{_}The modern Romans are merged in the general name of Italians,     who, with the exception of macaroni, have no specially     characteristic article of food.
10136-8{_}3102{_}216.
10136-8{_}3103{_}FROM ROME TO GAUL is, considering the means of modern locomotion, no great way; but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its inhabitants.
10136-8{_}3104{_}Louis XII.
10136-8{_}3105{_}engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with fresh-water animals, and Francis I. had twenty-two, whilst Henry the Great extended his requirements a little further, and had twenty-four.
10136-8{_}3106{_}In the time of Louis XIV.
10136-8{_}3107{_}the cooks had attained to such a degree of perfection in their art, that they could convert the form and flesh of the trout, pike, or carp, into the very shape and flavour of the most delicious game.
10136-8{_}3108{_}The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skill     and refinement in the preparing of food.
10136-8{_}3109{_}In place of plain     joints, French cookery delights in the marvels of what are     called made dishes, ragouts, stews, and fricassees, in which no     trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is     to be found.
10136-8{_}3110{_}217.
10136-8{_}3111{_}FROM GAUL WE CROSS TO BRITAIN, where it has been asserted, by, at least, one authority, that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish.
10136-8{_}3112{_}However this may be, we know that the British shores, particularly those of the North Sea, have always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish, which we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants, or likely to be lost upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted.
10136-8{_}3113{_}By the time of Edward II., fish had, in England, become a dainty, especially the sturgeon, which was permitted to appear on no table but that of the king.
10136-8{_}3114{_}In the fourteenth century, a decree of King John informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises; whilst in the days of the Troubadours, whales were fished for and caught in the Mediterranean Sea, for the purpose of being used as human food.
10136-8{_}3115{_}Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon their     piscatory appetites, there are happily none of any great     consequence upon the modern, who delight in wholesome food of     every kind.
10136-8{_}3116{_}Their taste is, perhaps, too much inclined to that     which is accounted solid and substantial; but they really eat     more moderately, even of animal food, than either the French or     the Germans.
10136-8{_}3117{_}Roast beef, or other viands cooked in the plainest     manner, are, with them, a sufficient luxury; yet they delight in     living _well_, whilst it is easy to prove how largely their     affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial     cheer.
10136-8{_}3118{_}In proof of this we will just observe, that if a great     dinner is to be celebrated, it is not uncommon for the appointed     stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner     among themselves, in order to arrange the great one, and after     that, to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the     great one cost.
10136-8{_}3119{_}This enjoyable disposition we take to form a     very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation.
10136-8{_}3120{_}218.
10136-8{_}3121{_}THE GENERAL USE OF FISH, as an article of human food among civilized nations, we have thus sufficiently shown, and will conclude this portion of our subject with the following hints, which ought to be remembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their dietary with a piscine dish:--  I.
10136-8{_}3122{_}Fish shortly before they spawn are, in general, best in condition.
10136-8{_}3123{_}When the spawning is just over, they are out of season, and unfit for human food.
10136-8{_}3124{_}II.
10136-8{_}3125{_}When fish is out of season, it has a transparent, bluish tinge, however much it may be boiled; when it is in season, its muscles are firm, and boil white and curdy.
10136-8{_}3126{_}III.
10136-8{_}3127{_}As food for invalids, white fish, such as the ling, cod, haddock, coal-fish, and whiting, are the best; flat fish, as soles, skate, turbot, and flounders, are also good.
10136-8{_}3128{_}IV.
10136-8{_}3129{_}Salmon, mackerel, herrings, and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed; therefore, to be in perfection, they should be prepared for the table on the day they are caught.
10136-8{_}3130{_}With flat fish, this is not of such consequence, as they will keep longer.
10136-8{_}3131{_}The turbot, for example, is improved by being kept a day or two.
10136-8{_}3132{_}GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH.
10136-8{_}3133{_}219.
10136-8{_}3134{_}IN DRESSING FISH, of any kind, the first point to be attended to, is to see that it be perfectly clean.
10136-8{_}3135{_}It is a common error to wash it too much; as by doing so the flavour is diminished.
10136-8{_}3136{_}If the fish is to be boiled, a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water, to give it firmness, after it is cleaned.
10136-8{_}3137{_}Cod-fish, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day; and if the weather be not very hot, they will be good for two days.
10136-8{_}3138{_}220.
10136-8{_}3139{_}WHEN FISH IS CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL, and a larger quantity is purchased than is immediately wanted, the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted, or pickled, or salted, and hung up; or it may be fried, that it may serve for stewing the next day.
10136-8{_}3140{_}Fresh-water fish, having frequently a muddy smell and taste, should be soaked in strong salt and water, after it has been well cleaned.
10136-8{_}3141{_}If of a sufficient size, it may be scalded in salt and water, and afterwards dried and dressed.
10136-8{_}3142{_}221.
10136-8{_}3143{_}FISH SHOULD BE PUT INTO COLD WATER, and set on the fire to do very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done.
10136-8{_}3144{_}Unless the fishes are small, they should never be put into warm water; nor should water, either hot or cold, be poured _on_ to the fish, as it is liable to break the skin: if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel.
10136-8{_}3145{_}The fish-plate may be drawn up, to see if the fish be ready, which may be known by its easily separating from the bone.
10136-8{_}3146{_}It should then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will become woolly.
10136-8{_}3147{_}The fish-plate should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot for serving, and a clean cloth over the fish, to prevent its losing its colour.
10136-8{_}3148{_}222.
10136-8{_}3149{_}IN GARNISHING FISH, great attention is required, and plenty of parsley, horseradish, and lemon should be used.
10136-8{_}3150{_}If fried parsley be used, it must be washed and picked, and thrown into fresh water.
10136-8{_}3151{_}When the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken up with a slice.
10136-8{_}3152{_}When well done, and with very good sauce, fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish.
10136-8{_}3153{_}The liver and roe, in some instances, should be placed on the dish, in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving; but to each recipe will be appended the proper mode of serving and garnishing.
10136-8{_}3154{_}223.
10136-8{_}3155{_}IF FISH IS TO BE FRIED OR BROILED, it must be dried in a nice soft cloth, after it is well cleaned and washed.
10136-8{_}3156{_}If for frying, brush it over with egg, and sprinkle it with some fine crumbs of bread.
10136-8{_}3157{_}If done a second time with the egg and bread, the fish will look so much the better.
10136-8{_}3158{_}If required to be very nice, a sheet of white blotting-paper must be placed to receive it, that it may be free from all grease.
10136-8{_}3159{_}It must also be of a beautiful colour, and all the crumbs appear distinct.
10136-8{_}3160{_}Butter gives a bad colour; lard and clarified dripping are most frequently used; but oil is the best, if the expense be no objection.
10136-8{_}3161{_}The fish should be put into the lard when boiling, and there should be a sufficiency of this to cover it.
10136-8{_}3162{_}224.
10136-8{_}3163{_}WHEN FISH IS BROILED, it must be seasoned, floured, and laid on a very clean gridiron, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking.
10136-8{_}3164{_}It must be broiled over a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not be scorched.
10136-8{_}3165{_}225.
10136-8{_}3166{_}IN CHOOSING FISH, it is well to remember that it is possible it may be _fresh_, and yet not _good_.
10136-8{_}3167{_}Under the head of each particular fish in this work, are appended rules for its choice and the months when it is in season.
10136-8{_}3168{_}Nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to have the fish good; as if this important course in a dinner does not give satisfaction, it is rarely that the repast goes off well.

10136-8{_}3170{_}CHAPTER VIII.
10136-8{_}3171{_}FISH.
10136-8{_}3172{_}[_Nothing is more difficult than to give the average prices of Fish, inasmuch as a few hours of bad weather at sea will, in the space of one day, cause such a difference in its supply, that the same fish--a turbot for instance--which may be bought to-day for six or seven shillings, will, to-morrow, be, in the London markets, worth, perhaps, almost as many pounds.
10136-8{_}3173{_}The average costs, therefore, which will be found appended to each recipe, must be understood as about the average price for the different kinds of fish, when the market is supplied upon an average, and when the various sorts are of an average size and quality._  GENERAL RULE IN CHOOSING FISH.--_A proof of freshness and goodness in most fishes, is their being covered with scales; for, if deficient in this respect, it is a sign of their being stale, or having been ill-used._]  FRIED ANCHOVIES.
10136-8{_}3174{_}226.
10136-8{_}3175{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of oil, 1/2 a glass of white wine, sufficient flour to thicken; 12 anchovies.
10136-8{_}3176{_}_Mode_.--Mix the oil and wine together, with sufficient flour to make them into a thickish paste; cleanse the anchovies, wipe them, dip them in the paste, and fry of a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}3177{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}3178{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 9d.
10136-8{_}3179{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}3180{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.
10136-8{_}3181{_}[Illustration: THE ANCHOVY.]
10136-8{_}3182{_}THE ANCHOVY.--In his book of "British Fishes," Mr. Yarrell     states that "the anchovy is a common fish in the Mediterranean,     from Greece to Gibraltar, and was well known to the Greeks and     Romans, by whom the liquor prepared from it, called _garum_, was     in great estimation.
10136-8{_}3183{_}Its extreme range is extended into the     Black Sea.
10136-8{_}3184{_}The fishing for them is carried on during the night,     and lights are used with the nets.
10136-8{_}3185{_}The anchovy is common on the     coasts of Portugal, Spain, and France.
10136-8{_}3186{_}It occurs, I have no     doubt, at the Channel Islands, and has been taken on the     Hampshire coast, and in the Bristol Channel."
10136-8{_}3187{_}Other fish, of     inferior quality, but resembling the real Gorgona anchovy, are     frequently sold for it, and passed off as genuine.
10136-8{_}3188{_}ANCHOVY BUTTER OR PASTE.
10136-8{_}3189{_}227.
10136-8{_}3190{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen anchovies, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}3191{_}of fresh butter.
10136-8{_}3192{_}_Mode_.--Wash the anchovies thoroughly; bone and dry them, and pound them in a mortar to a paste.
10136-8{_}3193{_}Mix the butter gradually with them, and rub the whole through a sieve.
10136-8{_}3194{_}Put it by in small pots for use, and carefully exclude the air with a bladder, as it soon changes the colour of anchovies, besides spoiling them.
10136-8{_}3195{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.
10136-8{_}3196{_}POTTED ANCHOVIES.
10136-8{_}3197{_}POTTED ANCHOVIES are made in the same way, by adding pounded mace, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste.
10136-8{_}3198{_}ANCHOVY TOAST.
10136-8{_}3199{_}228.
10136-8{_}3200{_}INGREDIENTS.--Toast 2 or 3 slices of bread, or, if wanted very savoury, fry them in clarified butter, and spread on them the paste, No.
10136-8{_}3201{_}227.
10136-8{_}3202{_}Made mustard, or a few grains of cayenne, may be added to the paste before laying it on the toast.
10136-8{_}3203{_}ANCHOVY PASTE.--"When some delicate zest," says a work just     issued on the adulterations of trade, "is required to make the     plain English breakfast more palatable, many people are in the     habit of indulging in what they imagine to be anchovies.
10136-8{_}3204{_}These     fish are preserved in a kind of pickling-bottle, carefully     corked down, and surrounded by a red-looking liquor, resembling     in appearance diluted clay.
10136-8{_}3205{_}The price is moderate, one shilling     only being demanded for the luxury.
10136-8{_}3206{_}When these anchovies are     what is termed potted, it implies that the fish have been     pounded into the consistency of a paste, and then placed in flat     pots, somewhat similar in shape to those used for pomatum.
10136-8{_}3207{_}This     paste is usually eaten spread upon toast, and is said to form an     excellent _bonne bouche_, which enables gentlemen at     wine-parties to enjoy their port with redoubled gusto.
10136-8{_}3208{_}Unfortunately, in six cases out of ten, the only portion of     these preserved delicacies, that contains anything indicative of     anchovies, is the paper label pasted on the bottle or pot, on     which the word itself is printed.... All the samples of anchovy     paste, analyzed by different medical men, have been found to be     highly and vividly coloured with very large quantities of bole     Armenian."
10136-8{_}3209{_}The anchovy itself, when imported, is of a dark dead     colour, and it is to make it a bright "handsome-looking sauce"     that this red earth is used.
10136-8{_}3210{_}BARBEL.
10136-8{_}3211{_}229.
10136-8{_}3212{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of port wine, a saltspoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 2 sliced onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, nutmeg and mace to taste, the juice of a lemon, 2 anchovies; 1 or 2 barbels, according to size.
10136-8{_}3213{_}_Mode_--Boil the barbels in salt and water till done; pour off some of the water, and, to the remainder, put the ingredients mentioned above.
10136-8{_}3214{_}Simmer gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, and strain.
10136-8{_}3215{_}Put in the fish; heat it gradually; but do not let it boil, or it will be broken.
10136-8{_}3216{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.
10136-8{_}3217{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}3218{_}_Seasonable_ from September to November.
10136-8{_}3219{_}[Illustration: THE BARBEL.]
10136-8{_}3220{_}THE BARBEL,--This fish takes its name from the barbs or wattels     at its mouth; and, in England, is esteemed as one of the worst     of the fresh-water fish.
10136-8{_}3221{_}It was, however, formerly, if not now,     a favourite with the Jews, excellent cookers of fish.
10136-8{_}3222{_}Others     would boil with it a piece of bacon, that it might have a     relish.
10136-8{_}3223{_}It is to be met with from two to three or four feet     long, and is said to live to a great age.
10136-8{_}3224{_}From Putney upwards,     in the Thames, some are found of large size; but they are valued     only as affording sport to the brethren of the angle.
10136-8{_}3225{_}BRILL.
10136-8{_}3226{_}230.
10136-8{_}3227{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}3228{_}of salt to each gallon of water; a little vinegar.
10136-8{_}3229{_}_Mode_.--Clean the brill, cut off the fins, and rub it over with a little lemon-juice, to preserve its whiteness.
10136-8{_}3230{_}Set the fish in sufficient cold water to cover it; throw in salt, in the above proportions, and a little vinegar, and bring it gradually to boil; simmer very gently till the fish is done, which will be in about 10 minutes; but the time for boiling, of course, depends entirely on the size of the fish.
10136-8{_}3231{_}Serve it on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, parsley, horseradish, and a little lobster coral sprinkled over the fish.
10136-8{_}3232{_}Send lobster or shrimp sauce and plain melted butter to table with it.
10136-8{_}3233{_}_Time_.--After the water boils, a small brill, 10 minutes; a large brill, 15 to 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}3234{_}_Average cost_, from 4s.
10136-8{_}3235{_}to 8s.
10136-8{_}3236{_}_Seasonable_ from August to April.
10136-8{_}3237{_}[Illustration: THE BRILL.]
10136-8{_}3238{_}THE BRILL.--This fish resembles the sole, but is broader, and     when large, is esteemed by many in a scarcely less degree than     the turbot, whilst it is much cheaper.
10136-8{_}3239{_}It is a fine fish, and is     abundant in the London market.
10136-8{_}3240{_}TO CHOOSE BRILL.--The flesh of this fish, like that of turbot, should be of a yellowish tint, and should be chosen on account of its thickness.
10136-8{_}3241{_}If the flesh has a bluish tint, it is not good.
10136-8{_}3242{_}CODFISH.
10136-8{_}3243{_}231.
10136-8{_}3244{_}Cod may be boiled whole; but a large head and shoulders are quite sufficient for a dish, and contain all that is usually helped, because, when the thick part is done, the tail is insipid and overdone.
10136-8{_}3245{_}The latter, cut in slices, makes a very good dish for frying; or it may be salted down and served with egg sauce and parsnips.
10136-8{_}3246{_}Cod, when boiled quite fresh, is watery; salting a little, renders it firmer.
10136-8{_}3247{_}[Illustration: THE COD.]
10136-8{_}3248{_}THE COD TRIBE.--The Jugular, characterized by bony gills, and     ventral fins before the pectoral ones, commences the second of     the Linnaean orders of fishes, and is a numerous tribe,     inhabiting only the depths of the ocean, and seldom visiting the     fresh waters.
10136-8{_}3249{_}They have a smooth head, and the gill membrane has     seven rays.
10136-8{_}3250{_}The body is oblong, and covered with deciduous     scales.
10136-8{_}3251{_}The fins are all inclosed in skin, whilst their rays are     unarmed.
10136-8{_}3252{_}The ventral fins are slender, and terminate in a point.
10136-8{_}3253{_}Their habits are gregarious, and they feed on smaller fish and     other marine animals.
10136-8{_}3254{_}COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.
10136-8{_}3255{_}232.
10136-8{_}3256{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 5 oz.
10136-8{_}3257{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}3258{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and rub a little salt over the thick part and inside of the fish, 1 or 2 hours before dressing it, as this very much improves the flavour.
10136-8{_}3259{_}Lay it in the fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it.
10136-8{_}3260{_}Be very particular not to pour the water on the fish, as it is liable to break it, and only keep it just simmering.
10136-8{_}3261{_}If the water should boil away, add a little by pouring it in at the side of the kettle, and not on the fish.
10136-8{_}3262{_}Add salt in the above proportion, and bring it gradually to a boil.
10136-8{_}3263{_}Skim very carefully, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it gently simmer till done.
10136-8{_}3264{_}Take it out and drain it; serve on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, horseradish, the roe and liver.
10136-8{_}3265{_}(_See_ Coloured Plate C.)  _Time_.--According to size, 1/2 an hour, more or less.
10136-8{_}3266{_}_Average cost_, from 3s.
10136-8{_}3267{_}to 6s.
10136-8{_}3268{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}3269{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}3270{_}_Note_.--Oyster sauce and plain melted butter should be served with this.
10136-8{_}3271{_}TO CHOOSE COD.--The cod should be chosen for the table when it is plump and round near the tail, when the hollow behind the head is deep, and when the sides are undulated as if they were ribbed.
10136-8{_}3272{_}The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavour, after the fish has been twenty-four hours out of the water.
10136-8{_}3273{_}The great point by which the cod should be judged is the firmness of its flesh; and, although the cod is not firm when it is alive, its quality may be arrived at by pressing the finger into the flesh.
10136-8{_}3274{_}If this rises immediately, the fish is good; if not, it is stale.
10136-8{_}3275{_}Another sign of its goodness is, if the fish, when it is cut, exhibits a bronze appearance, like the silver side of a round of beef.
10136-8{_}3276{_}When this is the case, the flesh will be firm when cooked.
10136-8{_}3277{_}Stiffness in a cod, or in any other fish, is a sure sign of freshness, though not always of quality.
10136-8{_}3278{_}Sometimes, codfish, though exhibiting signs of rough usage, will eat much better than those with red gills, so strongly recommended by many cookery-books.
10136-8{_}3279{_}This appearance is generally caused by the fish having been knocked about at sea, in the well-boats, in which they are conveyed from the fishing-grounds to market.
10136-8{_}3280{_}SALT COD, COMMONLY CALLED "SALT-FISH."
10136-8{_}3281{_}233.
10136-8{_}3282{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish.
10136-8{_}3283{_}_Mode_.--Wash the fish, and lay it all night in water, with a 1/4 pint of vinegar.
10136-8{_}3284{_}When thoroughly soaked, take it out, see that it is perfectly clean, and put it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it.
10136-8{_}3285{_}Heat it gradually, but do not let it boil much, or the fish will be hard.
10136-8{_}3286{_}Skim well, and when done, drain the fish and put it on a napkin garnished with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings.
10136-8{_}3287{_}_Time_.--About 1 hour.
10136-8{_}3288{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}3289{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}3290{_}_Seasonable_ in the spring.
10136-8{_}3291{_}_Sufficient_ for each person, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}3292{_}_Note_.--Serve with egg sauce and parsnips.
10136-8{_}3293{_}This is an especial dish on Ash Wednesday.
10136-8{_}3294{_}PRESERVING COD.--Immediately as the cod are caught, their heads     are cut off.
10136-8{_}3295{_}They are then opened, cleaned, and salted, when     they are stowed away in the hold of the vessel, in beds of five     or six yards square, head to tail, with a layer of salt to each     layer of fish.
10136-8{_}3296{_}When they have lain in this state three or four     days, in order that the water may drain from them, they are     shifted into a different part of the vessel, and again salted.
10136-8{_}3297{_}Here they remain till the vessel is loaded, when they are     sometimes cut into thick pieces and packed in barrels for the     greater convenience of carriage.
10136-8{_}3298{_}COD SOUNDS.
10136-8{_}3299{_}Should be well soaked in salt and water, and thoroughly washed before dressing them.
10136-8{_}3300{_}They are considered a great delicacy, and may either be broiled, fried, or boiled: if they are boiled, mix a little milk with the water.
10136-8{_}3301{_}COD SOUNDS, EN POULE.
10136-8{_}3302{_}234.
10136-8{_}3303{_}INGREDIENTS.--For forcemeat, 12 chopped oysters, 3 chopped anchovies, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}3304{_}of bread crumbs, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}3305{_}of butter, 2 eggs; seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace to taste; 4 cod sounds.
10136-8{_}3306{_}_Mode_.--Make the forcemeat by mixing the ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}3307{_}Wash the sounds, and boil them in milk and water for 1/2 an hour; take them out and let them cool.
10136-8{_}3308{_}Cover each with a layer of forcemeat, roll them up in a nice form, and skewer them.
10136-8{_}3309{_}Rub over with lard, dredge with flour, and cook them gently before the fire in a Dutch oven.
10136-8{_}3310{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}3311{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}3312{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}3313{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}3314{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}3315{_}THE SOUNDS IN CODFISH.--These are the air or swimming bladders,     by means of which the fishes are enabled to ascend or descend in     the water.
10136-8{_}3316{_}In the Newfoundland fishery they are taken out     previous to incipient putrefaction, washed from their slime and     salted for exportation.
10136-8{_}3317{_}The tongues are also cured and packed up     in barrels; whilst, from the livers, considerable quantities of     oil are extracted, this oil having been found possessed of the     most nourishing properties, and particularly beneficial in cases     of pulmonary affections.
10136-8{_}3318{_}COD PIE.
10136-8{_}3319{_}(_Economical_.)
10136-8{_}3320{_}I.
10136-8{_}3321{_}235.
10136-8{_}3322{_}INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 12 oysters, sufficient melted butter to moisten it; mashed potatoes enough to fill up the dish.
10136-8{_}3323{_}_Mode_.--Flake the fish from the bone, and carefully take away all the skin.
10136-8{_}3324{_}Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over the melted butter and oysters (or oyster sauce, if there is any left), and cover with mashed potatoes.

10136-8{_}3351{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}3352{_}THE FOOD OF THE COD.--This chiefly consists of the smaller     species of the scaly tribes, shell-fish, crabs, and worms.
10136-8{_}3353{_}Their     voracity is very great, and they will bite at any small body     they see moved by the water, even stones and pebbles, which are     frequently found in their stomachs.
10136-8{_}3354{_}They sometimes attain a     great size, but their usual weight is from 14 to 40 lbs.
10136-8{_}3355{_}COD A LA CREME.
10136-8{_}3356{_}238.

10136-8{_}3369{_}COD A LA BECHAMEL.
10136-8{_}3370{_}239.
10136-8{_}3371{_}INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 4 tablespoonfuls of béchamel (_see_ Sauces), 2 oz.
10136-8{_}3372{_}butter; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt; fried bread, a few bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}3373{_}_Mode_.--Flake the cod carefully, leaving out all skin and bone; put the béchamel in a stewpan with the butter, and stir it over the fire till the latter is melted; add seasoning, put in the fish, and mix it well with the sauce.
10136-8{_}3374{_}Make a border of fried bread round the dish, lay in the fish, sprinkle over with bread crumbs, and baste with butter.
10136-8{_}3375{_}Brown either before the fire or with a salamander, and garnish with toasted bread cut in fanciful shapes.
10136-8{_}3376{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}3377{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fish, 6d.
10136-8{_}3378{_}THE HABITAT OF THE COD.--This fish is found only in the seas of     the northern parts of the world, between the latitudes of 45°     and 66°.
10136-8{_}3379{_}Its great rendezvous are the sandbanks of Newfoundland,     Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and New England.
10136-8{_}3380{_}These places are its     favourite resorts; for there it is able to obtain great     quantities of worms, a food peculiarly grateful to it.
10136-8{_}3381{_}Another     cause of its attachment to these places has been said to be on     account of the vicinity to the Polar seas, where it returns to     spawn.
10136-8{_}3382{_}Few are taken north of Iceland, and the shoals never     reach so far south as the Straits of Gibraltar.
10136-8{_}3383{_}Many are taken     on the coasts of Norway, in the Baltic, and off the Orkneys,     which, prior to the discovery of Newfoundland, formed one of the     principal fisheries.
10136-8{_}3384{_}The London market is supplied by those     taken between the Dogger Bank, the Well Bank, and Cromer, on the     east coast of England.
10136-8{_}3385{_}COD A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.
10136-8{_}3386{_}240.
10136-8{_}3387{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of cod, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}3388{_}of butter, a little chopped shalot and parsley; pepper to taste, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, or rather less, when the flavour is not liked; the juice of 1/4 lemon.
10136-8{_}3389{_}_Mode_.--Boil the cod, and either leave it whole, or, what is still better, flake it from the bone, and take off the skin.
10136-8{_}3390{_}Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, shalot, pepper, and nutmeg.
10136-8{_}3391{_}Melt the butter gradually, and be very careful that it does not become like oil.

10136-8{_}3399{_}_Note_.--Cod that has been left will do for this.
10136-8{_}3400{_}THE SEASON FOR FISHING COD.--The best season for catching cod is     from the beginning of February to the end of April; and although     each fisherman engaged in taking them, catches no more than one     at a time, an expert hand will sometimes take four hundred in a     day.
10136-8{_}3401{_}The employment is excessively fatiguing, from the weight of     the fish as well as from the coldness of the climate.
10136-8{_}3402{_}COD A L'ITALIENNE.
10136-8{_}3403{_}241.
10136-8{_}3404{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of crimped cod, 1 shalot, 1 slice of ham minced very fine, 1/2 pint of white stock, No.

10136-8{_}3406{_}_Mode_.--Chop the shalots, mince the ham very fine, pour on the stock, and simmer for 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}3407{_}If the colour should not be good, add cream in the above proportion, and strain it through a fine sieve; season it, and put in the vinegar, lemon-juice, and sugar.
10136-8{_}3408{_}Now boil the cod, take out the middle bone, and skin it; put it on the dish without breaking, and pour the sauce over it.
10136-8{_}3409{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}3410{_}_Average cost_, 3s.
10136-8{_}3411{_}6d., with fresh fish.
10136-8{_}3412{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}3413{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}3414{_}THE FECUNDITY OF THE COD.--In our preceding remarks on the     natural history of fishes, we have spoken of the amazing     fruitfulness of this fish; but in this we see one more instance     of the wise provision which Nature has made for supplying the     wants of man.
10136-8{_}3415{_}So extensive has been the consumption of this     fish, that it is surprising that it has not long ago become     extinct; which would certainly have been the case, had it not     been for its wonderful powers of reproduction.
10136-8{_}3416{_}"So early as     1368," says Dr. Cloquet, "the inhabitants of Amsterdam had     dispatched fishermen to the coast of Sweden; and in the first     quarter of 1792, from the ports of France only, 210 vessels went     out to the cod-fisheries.
10136-8{_}3417{_}Every year, however, upwards of 10,000     vessels, of all nations, are employed in this trade, and bring     into the commercial world more than 40,000,000 of salted and     dried cod.
10136-8{_}3418{_}If we add to this immense number, the havoc made     among the legions of cod by the larger scaly tribes of the great     deep, and take into account the destruction to which the young     are exposed by sea-fowls and other inhabitants of the seas,     besides the myriads of their eggs destroyed by accident, it     becomes a miracle to find that such mighty multitudes of them     are still in existence, and ready to continue the exhaustless     supply.
10136-8{_}3419{_}Yet it ceases to excite our wonder when we remember that     the female can every year give birth to more than 9,000,000 at a     time."
10136-8{_}3420{_}BAKED CARP.
10136-8{_}3421{_}242.
10136-8{_}3422{_}INGREDIENTS--1 carp, forcemeat, bread crumbs, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}3423{_}butter, 1/2 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}3424{_}105, 1/2 pint of port wine, 6 anchovies, 2 onions sliced, 1 bay-leaf, a faggot of sweet herbs, flour to thicken, the juice of 1 lemon; cayenne and salt to taste; 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
10136-8{_}3425{_}_Mode_.--Stuff the carp with a delicate forcemeat, after thoroughly cleansing it, and sew it up to prevent the stuffing from falling out.
10136-8{_}3426{_}Rub it over with an egg, and sprinkle it with bread crumbs, lay it in a deep earthen dish, and drop the butter, oiled, over the bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}3427{_}Add the stock, onions, bay-leaf, herbs, wine, and anchovies, and bake for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}3428{_}Put 1 oz.
10136-8{_}3429{_}of butter into a stewpan, melt it, and dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up; put in the strained liquor from the carp, stir frequently, and when it has boiled, add the lemon-juice and seasoning.
10136-8{_}3430{_}Serve the carp on a dish garnished with parsley and cut lemon, and the sauce in a boat.
10136-8{_}3431{_}_Time_.--1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}3432{_}_Average cost_.
10136-8{_}3433{_}Seldom bought.
10136-8{_}3434{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}3435{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 or 2 persons.
10136-8{_}3436{_}[Illustration: THE CARP.]
10136-8{_}3437{_}THE CARP.--This species of fish inhabit the fresh waters, where     they feed on worms, insects, aquatic plants, small fish, clay,     or mould.
10136-8{_}3438{_}Some of them are migratory.
10136-8{_}3439{_}They have very small     mouths and no teeth, and the gill membrane has three rays.
10136-8{_}3440{_}The     body is smooth, and generally whitish.
10136-8{_}3441{_}The carp both grows and     increases very fast, and is accounted the most valuable of all     fish for the stocking of ponds.
10136-8{_}3442{_}It has been pronounced the queen     of river-fish, and was first introduced to this country about     three hundred years ago.
10136-8{_}3443{_}Of its sound, or air-bladder, a kind of     glue is made, and a green paint of its gall.
10136-8{_}3444{_}STEWED CARP.
10136-8{_}3445{_}243.
10136-8{_}3446{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 carp, salt, stock No.
10136-8{_}3447{_}105, 2 onions, 6 cloves, 12 peppercorns, 1 blade of mace, 1/4 pint of port wine, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste, a faggot of savoury herbs.
10136-8{_}3448{_}_Mode_.--Scale the fish, clean it nicely, and, if very large, divide it; lay it in the stewpan, after having rubbed a little salt on it, and put in sufficient stock to cover it; add the herbs, onions, and spices, and stew gently for 1 hour, or rather more, should it be very large.
10136-8{_}3449{_}Dish up the fish with great care, strain the liquor, and add to it the port wine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; give one boil, pour it over the fish, and serve.
10136-8{_}3450{_}_Time_.--1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}3451{_}_Average cost_.
10136-8{_}3452{_}Seldom bought.
10136-8{_}3453{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}3454{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 or 2 persons.
10136-8{_}3455{_}_Note_.--This fish can be boiled plain, and served with parsley and butter.
10136-8{_}3456{_}Chub and Char may be cooked in the same manner as the above, as also Dace and Roach.
10136-8{_}3457{_}THE AGE OF CARP.--This fish has been found to live 150 years.
10136-8{_}3458{_}The pond in the garden of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, contained     one that had lived there 70 years, and Gesner mentions an     instance of one 100 years old.
10136-8{_}3459{_}They are, besides, capable of     being tamed.
10136-8{_}3460{_}Dr. Smith, in his "Tour on the Continent," says, in     reference to the prince of Condé's seat at Chantilly, "The most     pleasing things about it were the immense shoals of very large     carp, silvered over with age, like silver-fish, and perfectly     tame; so that, when any passengers approached their watery     habitation, they used to come to the shore in such numbers as to     heave each other out of the water, begging for bread, of which a     quantity was always kept at hand, on purpose to feed them.
10136-8{_}3461{_}They     would even allow themselves to be handled."
10136-8{_}3462{_}[Illustration: THE CHUB.]
10136-8{_}3463{_}[Illustration: THE CHAR.]
10136-8{_}3464{_}THE CHUB.--This fish takes its name from its head, not only in     England, but in other countries.
10136-8{_}3465{_}It is a river-fish, and     resembles the carp, but is somewhat longer.
10136-8{_}3466{_}Its flesh is not in     much esteem, being coarse, and, when out of season, full of     small hairy bones.
10136-8{_}3467{_}The head and throat are the best parts.
10136-8{_}3468{_}The     roe is also good.
10136-8{_}3469{_}THE CHAR.--This is one of the most delicious of fish, being     esteemed by some superior to the salmon.
10136-8{_}3470{_}It is an inhabitant of     the deep lakes of mountainous countries.
10136-8{_}3471{_}Its flesh is rich and     red, and full of fat.
10136-8{_}3472{_}The largest and best kind is found in the     lakes of Westmoreland, and, as it is considered a rarity, it is     often potted and preserved.
10136-8{_}3473{_}THE DACE, OR DARE.--This fish is gregarious, and is seldom above     ten inches long; although, according to Linnaeus, it grows a     foot and a half in length.
10136-8{_}3474{_}Its haunts are in deep water, near     piles of bridges, where the stream is gentle, over gravelly,     sandy, or clayey bottoms; deep holes that are shaded, water-lily     leaves, and under the foam caused by an eddy.
10136-8{_}3475{_}In the warm months     they are to be found in shoals on the shallows near to streams.
10136-8{_}3476{_}They are in season about the end of April, and gradually improve     till February, when they attain their highest condition.
10136-8{_}3477{_}In that     month, when just taken, scotched (crimped), and broiled, they     are said to be more palatable than a fresh herring.
10136-8{_}3478{_}THE ROACH.--This fish is found throughout Europe, and the     western parts of Asia, in deep still rivers, of which it is an     inhabitant.
10136-8{_}3479{_}It is rarely more than a pound and a half in weight,     and is in season from September till March.
10136-8{_}3480{_}It is plentiful in     England, and the finest are caught in the Thames.
10136-8{_}3481{_}The proverb,     "as sound as a roach," is derived from the French name of this     fish being _roche_, which also means rock.

10136-8{_}3494{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}3495{_}TO CHOOSE CRAB.--The middle-sized crab is the best; and the crab, like the lobster, should be judged by its weight; for if light, it is watery.
10136-8{_}3496{_}HOT CRAB.
10136-8{_}3497{_}245.
10136-8{_}3498{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 crab, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 3 oz.

10136-8{_}3509{_}[Illustration: THE CRAB.]
10136-8{_}3510{_}THE CRAB TRIBE.--The whole of this tribe of animals have the     body covered with a hard and strong shell, and they live chiefly     in the sea.
10136-8{_}3511{_}Some, however, inhabit fresh waters, and a few live     upon land.
10136-8{_}3512{_}They feed variously, on aquatic or marine plants,     small fish, molluscae, or dead bodies.
10136-8{_}3513{_}The _black-clawed_     species is found on the rocky coasts of both Europe and India,     and is the same that is introduced to our tables, being much     more highly esteemed as a food than many others of the tribe.
10136-8{_}3514{_}The most remarkable feature in their history, is the changing of     their shells, and the reproduction of their broken claws.
10136-8{_}3515{_}The     former occurs once a year, usually between Christmas and Easter,     when the crabs retire to cavities in the rocks, or conceal     themselves under great stones.
10136-8{_}3516{_}Fishermen say that they will live     confined in a pot or basket for several months together, without     any other food than what is collected from the sea-water; and     that, even in this situation, they will not decrease in weight.
10136-8{_}3517{_}The _hermit_ crab is another of the species, and has the     peculiarity of taking possession of the deserted shell of some     other animal, as it has none of its own.
10136-8{_}3518{_}This circumstance was     known to the ancients, and is alluded to in the following lines     from Oppian:--       The hermit fish, unarm'd by Nature, left       Helpless and weak, grow strong by harmless theft.
10136-8{_}3519{_}Fearful they stroll, and look with panting wish       For the cast crust of some new-cover'd fish;       Or such as empty lie, and deck the shore,       Whose first and rightful owners are no more.
10136-8{_}3520{_}They make glad seizure of the vacant room,       And count the borrow'd shell their native home;       Screw their soft limbs to fit the winding case,       And boldly herd with the crustaceous race.
10136-8{_}3521{_}CRAYFISH.

10136-8{_}3567{_}THE EEL TRIBE.--The Apodal, or bony-gilled and ventral-finned     fish, of which the eel forms the first Linnaean tribe, in their     general aspect and manners, approach, in some instances, very     nearly to serpents.
10136-8{_}3568{_}They have a smooth head and slippery skin,     are in general naked, or covered with such small, soft, and     distant scales, as are scarcely visible.
10136-8{_}3569{_}Their bodies are long     and slender, and they are supposed to subsist entirely on animal     substances.
10136-8{_}3570{_}There are about nine species of them, mostly found     in the seas.
10136-8{_}3571{_}One of them frequents our fresh waters, and three     of the others occasionally pay a visit to our shores.

10136-8{_}3585{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}3586{_}THE COMMON EEL.--This fish is known frequently to quit its     native element, and to set off on a wandering expedition in the     night, or just about the close of clay, over the meadows, in     search of snails and other prey.
10136-8{_}3587{_}It also, sometimes, betakes     itself to isolated ponds, apparently for no other pleasure than     that which may be supposed to be found in a change of     habitation.
10136-8{_}3588{_}This, of course, accounts for eels being found in     waters which were never suspected to contain them.
10136-8{_}3589{_}This rambling     disposition in the eel has been long known to naturalists, and,     from the following lines, it seems to have been known to the     ancients:--        "Thus the mail'd tortoise, and the wand'ring; eel,       Oft to the neighbouring beach will silent steal."

10136-8{_}3614{_}_Note_.--Garfish may be dressed like eels, and either broiled or baked.
10136-8{_}3615{_}THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE EEL.--"Having occasion," says Dr.     Anderson, in the _Bee_, "to be once on a visit to a friend's     house on Dee-side, in Aberdeenshire, I frequently delighted to     walk by the banks of the river.
10136-8{_}3616{_}I, one day, observed something     like a black string moving along the edge of the water where it     was quite shallow.
10136-8{_}3617{_}Upon closer inspection, I discovered that     this was a shoal of young eels, so closely joined together as to     appear, on a superficial view, on continued body, moving briskly     up against the stream.
10136-8{_}3618{_}To avoid the retardment they experienced     from the force of the current, they kept close along the water's     edge the whole of the way, following all the bendings and     sinuosities of the river.
10136-8{_}3619{_}Where they were embayed, and in still     water, the shoal dilated in breadth, so as to be sometimes     nearly a foot broad; but when they turned a cape, where the     current was strong, they were forced to occupy less space and     press close to the shore, struggling very hard till they passed     it.
10136-8{_}3620{_}This shoal continued to move on, night and day without     interruption for several weeks.
10136-8{_}3621{_}Their progress might be at the     rate of about a mile an hour.
10136-8{_}3622{_}It was easy to catch the animals,     though they were very active and nimble.
10136-8{_}3623{_}They were eels     perfectly well formed in every respect, but not exceeding two     inches in length.
10136-8{_}3624{_}I conceive that the shoal did not contain, on     an average, less than from twelve to twenty in breadth; so that     the number that passed, on the whole, must have been very great.
10136-8{_}3625{_}Whence they came or whither they went, I know not; but the place     where I saw this, was six miles from the sea."
10136-8{_}3626{_}EEL PIE.

10136-8{_}3645{_}HAUNTS OF THE EEL.--These are usually in mud, among weeds, under     roots or stumps of trees, or in holes in the banks or the     bottoms of rivers.
10136-8{_}3646{_}Here they often grow to an enormous size,     sometimes weighing as much as fifteen or sixteen pounds.
10136-8{_}3647{_}They     seldom come forth from their hiding-places except in the night;     and, in winter, bury themselves deep in the mud, on account of     their great susceptibility of cold.

10136-8{_}3661{_}VORACITY OF THE EEL.--We find in a note upon Isaac Walton, by     Sir John Hawkins, that he knew of eels, when kept in ponds,     frequently destroying ducks.
10136-8{_}3662{_}From a canal near his house at     Twickenham he himself missed many young ducks; and on draining,     in order to clean it, great numbers of large eels were caught in     the mud.
10136-8{_}3663{_}When some of these were opened, there were found in     their stomachs the undigested heads of the quacking tribe which     had become their victims.

10136-8{_}3679{_}TENACITY OF LIFE IN THE EEL.--There is no fish so tenacious of     life as this.
10136-8{_}3680{_}After it is skinned and cut in pieces, the parts     will continue to move for a considerable time, and no fish will     live so long out of water.
10136-8{_}3681{_}[Illustration: THE LAMPREY.]
10136-8{_}3682{_}THE LAMPREY.--With the Romans, this fish occupied a respectable     rank among the piscine tribes, and in Britain it has at various     periods stood high in public favour.
10136-8{_}3683{_}It was the cause of the     death of Henry I. of England, who ate so much of them, that it     brought on an attack of indigestion, which carried him off.
10136-8{_}3684{_}It     is an inhabitant of the sea, ascending rivers, principally about     the end of winter, and, after passing a few months in fresh     water, returning again to its oceanic residence.
10136-8{_}3685{_}It is most in     season in March, April, and May, but is, by some, regarded as an     unwholesome food, although looked on by others as a great     delicacy.

10136-8{_}3772{_}[Illustration: THE HADDOCK.]
10136-8{_}3773{_}THE HADDOCK.--This fish migrates in immense shoals, and arrives     on the Yorkshire coast about the middle of winter.
10136-8{_}3774{_}It is an     inhabitant of the northern seas of Europe, but does not enter     the Baltic, and is not known in the Mediterranean.
10136-8{_}3775{_}On each side     of the body, just beyond the gills, it has a dark spot, which     superstition asserts to be the impressions of the finger and     thumb of St. Peter, when taking the tribute money out of a fish     of this species.
10136-8{_}3776{_}BOILED HADDOCK.
10136-8{_}3777{_}264.
10136-8{_}3778{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 1/4 lb.

10136-8{_}3780{_}_Mode_.--Scrape the fish, take out the inside, wash it thoroughly, and lay it in a kettle, with enough water to cover it and salt in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}3781{_}Simmer gently from 15 to 20 minutes, or rather more, should the fish be very large.

10136-8{_}3788{_}_Seasonable_ from August to February.
10136-8{_}3789{_}WEIGHT OF THE HADDOCK.--The haddock seldom grows to any great     size.
10136-8{_}3790{_}In general, they do not weigh more than two or three     pounds, or exceed ten or twelve inches in size.
10136-8{_}3791{_}Such are     esteemed very delicate eating; but they have been caught three     feet long, when their flesh is coarse.

10136-8{_}3793{_}I.
10136-8{_}3794{_}265.
10136-8{_}3795{_}Dried haddock should be gradually warmed through, either before or over a nice clear fire.
10136-8{_}3796{_}Hub a little piece of butter over, just before sending it to table.
10136-8{_}3797{_}II.
10136-8{_}3798{_}266.
10136-8{_}3799{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 large thick haddock, 2 bay-leaves, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, not forgetting parsley, a little butter and pepper; boiling water.
10136-8{_}3800{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the haddock into square pieces, make a basin hot by means of hot water, which pour out.
10136-8{_}3801{_}Lay in the fish, with the bay-leaves and herbs; cover with boiling water; put a plate over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}3802{_}Take out the slices, put them in a hot dish, rub over with butter and pepper, and serve.
10136-8{_}3803{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}3804{_}_Seasonable_ at any time, but best in winter.
10136-8{_}3805{_}THE FINNAN HADDOCK.--This is the common haddock cured and dried,     and takes its name from the fishing-village of Findhorn, near     Aberdeen, in Scotland, where the art has long attained to     perfection.
10136-8{_}3806{_}The haddocks are there hung up for a day or two in     the smoke of peat, when they are ready for cooking, and are     esteemed, by the Scotch, a great delicacy.
10136-8{_}3807{_}In London, an     imitation of them is made by washing the fish over with     pyroligneous acid, and hanging it up in a dry place for a few     days.
10136-8{_}3808{_}RED HERRINGS, or YARMOUTH BLOATERS.
10136-8{_}3809{_}267.
10136-8{_}3810{_}The best way to cook these is to make incisions in the skin across the fish, because they do not then require to be so long on the fire, and will be far better than when cut open.
10136-8{_}3811{_}The hard roe makes a nice relish by pounding it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spreading it on toast.
10136-8{_}3812{_}If very dry, soak in warm water 1 hour before dressing.
10136-8{_}3813{_}THE RED HERRING.--_Red_ herrings lie twenty-four hours in the     brine, when they are taken out and hung up in a smoking-house     formed to receive them.
10136-8{_}3814{_}A brushwood fire is then kindled beneath     them, and when they are sufficiently smoked and dried, they are     put into barrels for carriage.
10136-8{_}3815{_}BAKED WHITE HERRINGS.
10136-8{_}3816{_}268.
10136-8{_}3817{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 herrings, 4 bay-leaves, 12 cloves, 12 allspice, 2 small blades of mace, cayenne pepper and salt to taste, sufficient vinegar to fill up the dish.
10136-8{_}3818{_}_Mode_.--Take the herrings, cut off the heads, and gut them.
10136-8{_}3819{_}Put them in a pie-dish, heads and tails alternately, and, between each layer, sprinkle over the above ingredients.
10136-8{_}3820{_}Cover the fish with the vinegar, and bake for 1/2 hour, but do not use it till quite cold.
10136-8{_}3821{_}The herrings may be cut down the front, the backbone taken out, and closed again.
10136-8{_}3822{_}Sprats done in this way are very delicious.

10136-8{_}3825{_}each.
10136-8{_}3826{_}TO CHOOSE THE HERRING.--The more scales this fish has, the surer the sign of its freshness.
10136-8{_}3827{_}It should also have a bright and silvery look; but if red about the head, it is a sign that it has been dead for some time.
10136-8{_}3828{_}[Illustration: THE HERRING.]
10136-8{_}3829{_}THE HERRING.--The herring tribe are found in the greatest     abundance in the highest northern latitudes, where they find a     quiet retreat, and security from their numerous enemies.
10136-8{_}3830{_}Here     they multiply beyond expression, and, in shoals, come forth from     their icy region to visit other portions of the great deep.
10136-8{_}3831{_}In     June they are found about Shetland, whence they proceed down to     the Orkneys, where they divide, and surround the islands of     Great Britain and Ireland.
10136-8{_}3832{_}The principal British     herring-fisheries are off the Scotch and Norfolk coasts; and the     fishing is always carried on by means of nets, which are usually     laid at night; for, if stretched by day, they are supposed to     frighten the fish away.
10136-8{_}3833{_}The moment the herring is taken out of     the water it dies.
10136-8{_}3834{_}Hence the origin of the common saying, "dead     as a herring."
10136-8{_}3835{_}KEGEREE.

10136-8{_}3844{_}270.
10136-8{_}3845{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}3846{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}3847{_}_Mode_.--Buy the lobsters alive, and choose those that are heavy and full of motion, which is an indication of their freshness.
10136-8{_}3848{_}When the shell is incrusted, it is a sign they are old: medium-sized lobsters are the best.
10136-8{_}3849{_}Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the lobster, and keep it boiling quickly from 20 minutes to 3/4 hour, according to its size, and do not forget to skim well.
10136-8{_}3850{_}If it boils too long, the meat becomes thready, and if not done enough, the spawn is not red: this must be obviated by great attention.
10136-8{_}3851{_}Hub the shell over with a little butter or sweet oil, which wipe off again.
10136-8{_}3852{_}_Time_.--Small lobster, 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; large ditto, 1/2 to 1/3 hour.

10136-8{_}3856{_}6d.
10136-8{_}3857{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from March to October.
10136-8{_}3858{_}TO CHOOSE LOBSTERS.--This shell-fish, if it has been cooked alive, as it ought to have been, will have a stiffness in the tail, which, if gently raised, will return with a spring.
10136-8{_}3859{_}Care, however, must be taken in thus proving it; for if the tail is pulled straight out, it will not return; when the fish might be pronounced inferior, which, in reality, may not be the case.
10136-8{_}3860{_}In order to be good, lobsters should be weighty for their bulk; if light, they will be watery; and those of the medium size, are always the best.
10136-8{_}3861{_}Small-sized lobsters are cheapest, and answer very well for sauce.
10136-8{_}3862{_}In boiling lobsters, the appearance of the shell will be much improved by rubbing over it a little butter or salad-oil on being immediately taken from the pot.
10136-8{_}3863{_}[Illustration: THE LOBSTER.]
10136-8{_}3864{_}THE LOBSTER.--This is one of the crab tribe, and is found on     most of the rocky coasts of Great Britain.
10136-8{_}3865{_}Some are caught with     the hand, but the larger number in pots, which serve all the     purposes of a trap, being made of osiers, and baited with     garbage.
10136-8{_}3866{_}They are shaped like a wire mousetrap; so that when the     lobsters once enter them, they cannot get out again.
10136-8{_}3867{_}They are     fastened to a cord and sunk in the sea, and their place marked     by a buoy.
10136-8{_}3868{_}The fish is very prolific, and deposits of its eggs     in the sand, where they are soon hatched.
10136-8{_}3869{_}On the coast of     Norway, they are very abundant, and it is from there that the     English metropolis is mostly supplied.
10136-8{_}3870{_}They are rather     indigestible, and, as a food, not so nurtritive as they are     generally supposed to be.
10136-8{_}3871{_}HOT LOBSTER.

10136-8{_}3874{_}of butter, grated nutmeg; salt, pepper, and pounded mace, to taste; bread crumbs, 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}3875{_}_Mode_.--Pound the meat of the lobster to a smooth paste with the butter and seasoning, and add a few bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}3876{_}Beat the eggs, and make the whole mixture into the form of a lobster; pound the spawn, and sprinkle over it.
10136-8{_}3877{_}Bake 1/4 hour, and just before serving, lay over it the tail and body shell, with the small claws underneath, to resemble a lobster.

10136-8{_}3883{_}LOBSTER SALAD.
10136-8{_}3884{_}272.
10136-8{_}3885{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 hen lobster, lettuces, endive, small salad (whatever is in season), a little chopped beetroot, 2 hard-boiled eggs, a few slices of cucumber.
10136-8{_}3886{_}For dressing, equal quantities of oil and vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs; cayenne and salt to taste; 3 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce.
10136-8{_}3887{_}These ingredients should be mixed perfectly smooth, and form a creamy-looking sauce.
10136-8{_}3888{_}_Mode_.--Wash the salad, and thoroughly dry it by shaking it in a cloth.
10136-8{_}3889{_}Cut up the lettuces and endive, pour the dressing on them, and lightly throw in the small salad.
10136-8{_}3890{_}Mix all well together with the pickings from the body of the lobster; pick the meat from the shell, cut it up into nice square pieces, put half in the salad, the other half reserve for garnishing.
10136-8{_}3891{_}Separate the yolks from the whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs; chop the whites very fine, and rub the yolks through a sieve, and afterwards the coral from the inside.
10136-8{_}3892{_}Arrange the salad lightly on a glass dish, and garnish, first with a row of sliced cucumber, then with the pieces of lobster, the yolks and whites of the eggs, coral, and beetroot placed alternately, and arranged in small separate bunches, so that the colours contrast nicely.
10136-8{_}3893{_}_Average cost_, 3s.
10136-8{_}3894{_}6d.
10136-8{_}3895{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}3896{_}_Seasonable_ from April to October; may be had all the year, but salad is scarce and expensive in winter.
10136-8{_}3897{_}_Note_.--A few crayfish make a pretty garnishing to lobster salad.
10136-8{_}3898{_}THE SHELL OF THE LOBSTER.--Like the others of its tribe, the     lobster annually casts its shell.
10136-8{_}3899{_}Previously to its throwing off     the old one, it appears sick, languid, and restless, but in the     course of a few days it is entirely invested in its new coat of     armour.
10136-8{_}3900{_}Whilst it is in a defenceless state, however, it seeks     some lonely place, where it may lie undisturbed, and escape the     horrid fate of being devoured by some of its own species who     have the advantage of still being encased in their mail.
10136-8{_}3901{_}LOBSTER (a la Mode Francaise).
10136-8{_}3902{_}273.
10136-8{_}3903{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, pounded mace, and cayenne to taste; bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}3904{_}_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the shell, and cut it up into small square pieces; put the stock, cream, and seasoning into a stewpan, add the lobster, and let it simmer gently for 6 minutes.
10136-8{_}3905{_}Serve it in the shell, which must be nicely cleaned, and have a border of puff-paste; cover it with bread crumbs, place small pieces of butter over, and brown before the fire, or with a salamander.
10136-8{_}3906{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}3907{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}3908{_}6d.
10136-8{_}3909{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}3910{_}CELERITY OF THE LOBSTER.--In its element, the lobster is able to     run with great speed upon its legs, or small claws, and, if     alarmed, to spring, tail foremost, to a considerable distance,     "even," it is said, "with the swiftness of a bird flying."
10136-8{_}3911{_}Fishermen have seen some of them pass about thirty feet with a     wonderful degree of swiftness.
10136-8{_}3912{_}When frightened, they will take     their spring, and, like a chamois of the Alps, plant themselves     upon the very spot upon which they designed to hold themselves.
10136-8{_}3913{_}LOBSTER CURRY (an Entree).
10136-8{_}3914{_}274.

10136-8{_}3928{_}They should not be very thick.
10136-8{_}3929{_}Brush them over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs, and stick a short piece of the small claw in the top of each; fry them of a nice brown in boiling lard, and drain them before the fire, on a sieve reversed; arrange them nicely on a dish, and pour béchamel in the middle, but not over the cutlets.
10136-8{_}3930{_}_Time_.--About 8 minutes after the cutlets are made.
10136-8{_}3931{_}_Average cost_ for this dish, 2s.

10136-8{_}3933{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}3934{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}3935{_}ANCIENT MODE OF COOKING THE LOBSTER.--When this fish was to be     served for the table, among the ancients, it was opened     lengthwise, and filled with a gravy composed of coriander and     pepper.
10136-8{_}3936{_}It was then put on the gridiron and slowly cooked,     whilst it was being basted with the same kind of gravy with     which the flesh had become impregnated.
10136-8{_}3937{_}TO DRESS LOBSTERS.
10136-8{_}3938{_}276.
10136-8{_}3939{_}When the lobster is boiled, rub it over with a little salad-oil, which wipe off again; separate the body from the tail, break off the great claws, and crack them at the joints, without injuring the meat; split the tail in halves, and arrange all neatly in a dish, with the body upright in the middle, and garnish with parsley.
10136-8{_}3940{_}(_See_ Coloured Plate, H.)   LOBSTER PATTIES (an Entree).
10136-8{_}3941{_}277.

10136-8{_}3943{_}_Mode_.--Line the patty-pans with puff-paste, and put into each a small piece of bread: cover with paste, brush over with egg, and bake of a light colour.
10136-8{_}3944{_}Take as much lobster as is required, mince the meat very fine, and add the above ingredients; stir it over the fire for 6 minutes; remove the lids of the patty-cases, take out the bread, fill with the mixture, and replace the covers.
10136-8{_}3945{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}3946{_}LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF THE LOBSTER.--It is said that the attachment     of this animal is strong to some particular parts of the sea, a     circumstance celebrated in the following lines:--        "Nought like their home the constant lobsters prize,       And foreign shores and seas unknown despise.
10136-8{_}3947{_}Though cruel hands the banish'd wretch expel,       And force the captive from his native cell,       He will, if freed, return with anxious care,       Find the known rock, and to his home repair;       No novel customs learns in different seas,       But wonted food and home-taught manners please."

10136-8{_}3961{_}_Note_.--Potted lobster may be used cold, or as _fricassee_ with cream sauce.
10136-8{_}3962{_}How the Lobster Feeds.--The pincers of the lobster's large claws     are furnished with nobs, and those of the other, are always     serrated.
10136-8{_}3963{_}With the former, it keeps firm hold of the stalks of     submarine plants, and with the latter, it cuts and minces its     food with great dexterity.
10136-8{_}3964{_}The knobbed, or numb claw, as it is     called by fishermen, is sometimes on the right and sometimes on     the left, indifferently.

10136-8{_}4002{_}[Illustration: THE MACKEREL.]
10136-8{_}4003{_}THE MACKEREL.--This is not only one of the most     elegantly-formed, but one of the most beautifully-coloured     fishes, when taken out of the sea, that we have.
10136-8{_}4004{_}Death, in some     degree, impairs the vivid splendour of its colours; but it does     not entirely obliterate them.
10136-8{_}4005{_}It visits the shores of Great     Britain in countless shoals, appearing about March, off the     Land's End; in the bays of Devonshire, about April; off Brighton     in the beginning of May; and on the coast of Suffolk about the     beginning of June.
10136-8{_}4006{_}In the Orkneys they are seen till August; but     the greatest fishery is on the west coasts of England.
10136-8{_}4007{_}TO CHOOSE MACKEREL.--In choosing this fish, purchasers should, to a great extent, be regulated by the brightness of its appearance.
10136-8{_}4008{_}If it have a transparent, silvery hue, the flesh is good; but if it be red about the head, it is stale.
10136-8{_}4009{_}FILLETS OF MACKEREL.
10136-8{_}4010{_}282.
10136-8{_}4011{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 large mackerel, 1 oz.

10136-8{_}4014{_}_Mode_.--Clean the fish, and fillet it; scald the herbs, chop them fine, and put them with the butter and stock into a stewpan.
10136-8{_}4015{_}Lay in the mackerel, and simmer very gently for 10 minutes; take them out, and put them on a hot dish.
10136-8{_}4016{_}Dredge in a little flour, add the other ingredients, give one boil, and pour it over the mackerel.

10136-8{_}4023{_}Serve with _maître d'hôtel_ sauce and plain melted butter.
10136-8{_}4024{_}THE VORACITY OF THE MACKEREL.--The voracity of this fish is very     great, and, from their immense numbers, they are bold in     attacking objects of which they might, otherwise, be expected to     have a wholesome dread.
10136-8{_}4025{_}Pontoppidan relates an anecdote of a     sailor belonging to a ship lying in one of the harbours on the     coast of Norway, who, having gone into the sea to bathe, was     suddenly missed by his companions; in the course of a few     minutes, however, he was seen on the surface, with great numbers     of mackerel clinging to him by their mouths.
10136-8{_}4026{_}His comrades     hastened in a boat to his assistance; but when they had struck     the fishes from him and got him up, they found he was so     severely bitten, that he shortly afterward expired.

10136-8{_}4036{_}When     mackerel was employed, a few of them were placed in a small     vase, with a large quantity of salt, which was well stirred, and     then left to settle for some hours.
10136-8{_}4037{_}On the following day, this     was put into an earthen pot, which was uncovered, and placed in     a situation to get the rays of the sun.
10136-8{_}4038{_}At the end of two or     three months, it was hermetically sealed, after having had added     to it a quantity of old wine, equal to one third of the mixture.

10136-8{_}4049{_}[Illustration: THE GREY MULLET.]
10136-8{_}4050{_}THE GREY MULLET.--This is quite a different fish from the red     mullet, is abundant on the sandy coasts of Great Britain, and     ascends rivers for miles.
10136-8{_}4051{_}On the south coast it is very     plentiful, and is considered a fine fish.
10136-8{_}4052{_}It improves more than     any other salt-water fish when kept in ponds.
10136-8{_}4053{_}RED MULLET.
10136-8{_}4054{_}285.
10136-8{_}4055{_}INGREDIENTS.--Oiled paper, thickening of butter and flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 glass of sherry; cayenne and salt to taste.

10136-8{_}4061{_}each.
10136-8{_}4062{_}_Seasonable_ at any time, but more plentiful in summer.
10136-8{_}4063{_}_Note_.--Red mullet may be broiled, and should be folded in oiled paper, the same as in the preceding recipe, and seasoned with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}4064{_}They may be served without sauce; but if any is required, use melted _butter_, Italian or anchovy sauce.
10136-8{_}4065{_}They should never be plain boiled.
10136-8{_}4066{_}[Illustration: THE STRIPED RED MULLET.]
10136-8{_}4067{_}THE STRIPED RED MULLET.--This fish was very highly esteemed by     the ancients, especially by the Romans, who gave the most     extravagant prices for it.
10136-8{_}4068{_}Those of 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}4069{_}weight were valued at     about £15 each; those of 4 lbs.
10136-8{_}4070{_}at £60, and, in the reign of     Tiberius, three of them were sold for £209.
10136-8{_}4071{_}To witness the     changing loveliness of their colour during their dying agonies,     was one of the principal reasons that such a high price was paid     for one of these fishes.
10136-8{_}4072{_}It frequents our Cornish and Sussex     coasts, and is in high request, the flesh being firm, white, and     well flavoured.
10136-8{_}4073{_}FRIED OYSTERS.
10136-8{_}4074{_}286.
10136-8{_}4075{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}4076{_}butter, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, a little chopped lemon-peel, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.
10136-8{_}4077{_}_Mode_.--Boil the oysters for 1 minute in their own liquor, and drain them; fry them with the butter, ketchup, lemon-peel, and parsley; lay them on a dish, and garnish with fried potatoes, toasted sippets, and parsley.
10136-8{_}4078{_}This is a delicious delicacy, and is a favourite Italian dish.

10136-8{_}4084{_}[Illustration: THE EDIBLE OYSTER.]
10136-8{_}4085{_}THE EDIBLE OYSTER:--This shell-fish is almost universally     distributed near the shores of seas in all latitudes, and they     especially abound on the coasts of France and Britain.
10136-8{_}4086{_}The     coasts most celebrated, in England, for them, are those of Essex     and Suffolk.
10136-8{_}4087{_}Here they are dredged up by means of a net with an     iron scraper at the mouth, that is dragged by a rope from a boat     over the beds.
10136-8{_}4088{_}As soon as taken from their native beds, they are     stored in pits, formed for the purpose, furnished with sluices,     through which, at the spring tides, the water is suffered to     flow.
10136-8{_}4089{_}This water, being stagnant, soon becomes green in warm     weather; and, in a few days afterwards, the oysters acquire the     same tinge, which increases their value in the market.
10136-8{_}4090{_}They do     not, however, attain their perfection and become fit for sale     till the end of six or eight weeks.
10136-8{_}4091{_}Oysters are not considered     proper for the table till they are about a year and a half old;     so that the brood of one spring are not to be taken for sale,     till, at least, the September twelvemonth afterwards.

10136-8{_}4127{_}THE OYSTER AND THE SCALLOP.--The oyster is described as a     bivalve shell-fish, having the valves generally unequal.
10136-8{_}4128{_}The     hinge is without teeth, but furnished with a somewhat oval     cavity, and mostly with lateral transverse grooves.
10136-8{_}4129{_}From a     similarity in the structure of the hinge, oysters and scallops     have been classified as one tribe; but they differ very     essentially both in their external appearance and their habits.
10136-8{_}4130{_}Oysters adhere to rocks, or, as in two or three species, to     roots of trees on the shore; while the scallops are always     detached, and usually lurk in the sand.

10136-8{_}4142{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}4143{_}THE OYSTER FISHERY.--The oyster fishery in Britain is esteemed     of so much importance, that it is regulated by a Court of     Admiralty.
10136-8{_}4144{_}In the month of May, the fishermen are allowed to     take the oysters, in order to separate the spawn from the     cultch, the latter of which is thrown in again, to preserve the     bed for the future.
10136-8{_}4145{_}After this month, it is felony to carry away     the cultch, and otherwise punishable to take any oyster, between     the shells of which, when closed, a shilling will rattle.
10136-8{_}4146{_}TO KEEP OYSTERS.
10136-8{_}4147{_}290.
10136-8{_}4148{_}Put them in a tub, and cover them with salt and water.

10136-8{_}4150{_}If left without water every alternate 12 hours, they will be much better than if constantly kept in it.
10136-8{_}4151{_}Never put the same water twice to them.

10136-8{_}4157{_}Make some lard hot in a deep frying-pan, put in the oysters, one at a time; when done, take them up with a sharp-pointed skewer, and dish them on a napkin.
10136-8{_}4158{_}Fried oysters are frequently used for garnishing boiled fish, and then a few bread crumbs should be added to the flour.
10136-8{_}4159{_}_Time_.--5 or 6 minutes.

10136-8{_}4163{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}4164{_}EXCELLENCE OF THE ENGLISH OYSTER.--The French assert that the     English oysters, which are esteemed the best in Europe, were     originally procured from Cancalle Bay, near St. Malo; but they     assign no proof for this.
10136-8{_}4165{_}It is a fact, however, that the     oysters eaten in ancient Rome were nourished in the channel     which then parted the Isle of Thanet from England, and which has     since been filled up, and converted into meadows.

10136-8{_}4175{_}_Seasonable_ from September to November.
10136-8{_}4176{_}_Note_.--Tench may be boiled the same way, and served with the same sauces.
10136-8{_}4177{_}[Illustration: THE PERCH.]
10136-8{_}4178{_}THE PERCH.--This is one of the best, as it is one of the most     common, of our fresh-water fishes, and is found in nearly all     the lakes and rivers in Britain and Ireland, as well as through     the whole of Europe within the temperate zone.
10136-8{_}4179{_}It is extremely     voracious, and it has the peculiarity of being gregarious, which     is contrary to the nature of all fresh-water fishes of prey.
10136-8{_}4180{_}The     best season to angle for it is from the beginning of May to the     middle of July.
10136-8{_}4181{_}Large numbers of this fish are bred in the     Hampton Court and Bushy Park ponds, all of which are well     supplied with running water and with plenty of food; yet they     rarely attain a large size.
10136-8{_}4182{_}In the Regent's Park they are also     very numerous; but are seldom heavier than three quarters of a     pound.
10136-8{_}4183{_}FRIED PERCH.

10136-8{_}4205{_}_Mode_.--Scale and clean the pike, and fasten the tail in its mouth by means of a skewer.
10136-8{_}4206{_}Lay it in cold water, and when it boils, throw in the salt and vinegar.
10136-8{_}4207{_}The time for boiling depends, of course, on the size of the fish; but a middling-sized pike will take about 1/2 an hour.
10136-8{_}4208{_}Serve with Dutch or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter.
10136-8{_}4209{_}_Time_.--According to size, 1/2 to 1 hour.--_Average cost_.

10136-8{_}4212{_}[Illustration: THE PIKE.]
10136-8{_}4213{_}THE PIKE.--This fish is, on account of its voracity, termed the     freshwater shark, and is abundant in most of the European lakes,     especially those of the northern parts.
10136-8{_}4214{_}It grows to an immense     size, some attaining to the measure of eight feet, in Lapland     and Russia.
10136-8{_}4215{_}The smaller lakes, of this country and Ireland, vary     in the kinds of fish they produce; some affording trout, others     pike; and so on.
10136-8{_}4216{_}Where these happen to be together, however, the     trout soon becomes extinct.
10136-8{_}4217{_}"Within a short distance of     Castlebar," says a writer on sports, "there is a small bog-lake     called Derreens.
10136-8{_}4218{_}Ten years ago it was celebrated for its     numerous well-sized trouts.
10136-8{_}4219{_}Accidentally pike effected a passage     into the lake from the Minola river, and now the trouts are     extinct, or, at least, none of them are caught or seen.
10136-8{_}4220{_}Previous     to the intrusion of the pikes, half a dozen trouts would be     killed in an evening in Derreens, whose collective weight often     amounted to twenty pounds."
10136-8{_}4221{_}As an eating fish, the pike is in     general dry.
10136-8{_}4222{_}BAKED PIKE.
10136-8{_}4223{_}296.
10136-8{_}4224{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 pike, a nice delicate stuffing (_see_ Forcemeats), 1 egg, bread crumbs, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4225{_}butter.
10136-8{_}4226{_}_Mode_.--Scale the fish, take out the gills, wash, and wipe it thoroughly dry; stuff it with forcemeat, sew it up, and fasten the tail in the mouth by means of a skewer; brush it over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and baste with butter, before putting it in the oven, which must be well heated.
10136-8{_}4227{_}When the pike is of a nice brown colour, cover it with buttered paper, as the outside would become too dry.
10136-8{_}4228{_}If 2 are dressed, a little variety may be made by making one of them green with a little chopped parsley mixed with the bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}4229{_}Serve anchovy or Dutch sauce, and plain melted butter with it.
10136-8{_}4230{_}_Time_.--According to size, 1 hour, more or less.

10136-8{_}4253{_}Slice and fry the onions a light brown; put them in a stewpan, on the top of which put the fish without washing, and add the ginger, lemon-juice, and water.
10136-8{_}4254{_}Cook slowly for 1/2 hour, and do not let the fish boil, or it will break.
10136-8{_}4255{_}Take it out, and when the liquor is cool, add 6 well-beaten eggs; simmer till it thickens, when pour over the fish, and serve.

10136-8{_}4261{_}[Illustration: THE PLAICE.]
10136-8{_}4262{_}THE PLAICE.--This fish is found both in the Baltic and the     Mediterranean, and is also abundant on the coast of England.
10136-8{_}4263{_}It     keeps well, and, like all ground-fish, is very tenacious of     life.
10136-8{_}4264{_}Its flesh is inferior to that of the sole, and, as it is a     low-priced fish, it is generally bought by the poor.
10136-8{_}4265{_}The best     brought to the London market are called _Dowers plaice_, from     their being caught in the Dowers, or flats, between Hastings and     Folkstone.
10136-8{_}4266{_}TO BOIL PRAWNS OR SHRIMPS.
10136-8{_}4267{_}299.
10136-8{_}4268{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4269{_}salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}4270{_}_Mode_.--Prawns should be very red, and have no spawn under the tail; much depends on their freshness and the way in which they are cooked.
10136-8{_}4271{_}Throw them into boiling water, salted as above, and keep them boiling for about 7 or 8 minutes.
10136-8{_}4272{_}Shrimps should be done in the same way; but less time must be allowed.
10136-8{_}4273{_}It may easily be known when they are done by their changing colour.
10136-8{_}4274{_}Care should be taken that they are not over-boiled, as they then become tasteless and indigestible.
10136-8{_}4275{_}_Time_.--Prawns, about 8 minutes; shrimps, about 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}4276{_}_Average cost_, prawns, 2s.

10136-8{_}4278{_}; shrimps, 6d.
10136-8{_}4279{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}4280{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}4281{_}TO DRESS PRAWNS.
10136-8{_}4282{_}300.
10136-8{_}4283{_}Cover a dish with a large cup reversed, and over that lay a small white napkin.
10136-8{_}4284{_}Arrange the prawns on it in the form of a pyramid, and garnish with plenty of parsley.
10136-8{_}4285{_}BOILED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4286{_}301.
10136-8{_}4287{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 oz.
10136-8{_}4288{_}of salt to each gallon of water,--sufficient water to cover the fish.
10136-8{_}4289{_}_Mode_.--Scale and clean the fish, and be particular that no blood is left inside; lay it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it, adding salt in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}4290{_}Bring it quickly to a boil, take off all the scum, and let it simmer gently till the fish is done, which will be when the meat separates easily from the bone.
10136-8{_}4291{_}Experience alone can teach the cook to fix the time for boiling fish; but it is especially to be remembered, that it should never be underdressed, as then nothing is more unwholesome.
10136-8{_}4292{_}Neither let it remain in the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked, as that would render it insipid, watery, and colourless.
10136-8{_}4293{_}Drain it, and if not wanted for a few minutes, keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it.
10136-8{_}4294{_}Serve on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and parsley, and send lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter to table with it.
10136-8{_}4295{_}A dish of dressed cucumber usually accompanies this fish.
10136-8{_}4296{_}_Time_.--8 minutes to each lb.
10136-8{_}4297{_}for large thick salmon; 6 minutes for thin fish.
10136-8{_}4298{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.

10136-8{_}4300{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}4301{_}_Seasonable_ from April to August.
10136-8{_}4302{_}_Sufficient_, 1/2 lb., or rather less, for each person.
10136-8{_}4303{_}_Note_.--Cut lemon should be put on the table with this fish; and a little of the juice squeezed over it is considered by many persons a most agreeable addition.
10136-8{_}4304{_}Boiled peas are also, by some connoisseurs, considered especially adapted to be served with salmon.
10136-8{_}4305{_}TO CHOOSE SALMON.--To be good, the belly should be firm and thick, which may readily be ascertained by feeling it with the thumb and finger.
10136-8{_}4306{_}The circumstance of this fish having red gills, though given as a standing rule in most cookery-books, as a sign of its goodness, is not at all to be relied on, as this quality can be easily given them by art.
10136-8{_}4307{_}SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE.
10136-8{_}4308{_}302.
10136-8{_}4309{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4310{_}batter, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 shalot; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.
10136-8{_}4311{_}_Mode_.--Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter over it, and add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning into the fish; baste it frequently; when done, take it out and drain for a minute or two; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve.
10136-8{_}4312{_}Salmon dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious.
10136-8{_}4313{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}4314{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}4315{_}3d.

10136-8{_}4317{_}_Seasonable_ from April to August.
10136-8{_}4318{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4319{_}THE MIGRATORY HABITS OF THE SALMON.--The instinct with which the     salmon revisits its native river, is one of the most curious     circumstances in its natural history.
10136-8{_}4320{_}As the swallow returns     annually to its nest, so it returns to the same spot to deposit     its ova.
10136-8{_}4321{_}This fact would seem to have been repeatedly proved.
10136-8{_}4322{_}M.     De Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon's tail, and found     that, for three successive seasons, it returned to the same     place.
10136-8{_}4323{_}Dr. Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been     attached by eastern princes to salmon, to prove that a     communication existed between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian     and Northern Seas, and that the experiment succeeded.
10136-8{_}4324{_}COLLARED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4325{_}303.
10136-8{_}4326{_}INGREDIENTS.--A piece of salmon, say 3 lbs., a high seasoning of salt, pounded mace, and pepper; water and vinegar, 3 bay-leaves.
10136-8{_}4327{_}_Mode_.--Split the fish; scale, bone, and wash it thoroughly clean; wipe it, and rub in the seasoning inside and out; roll it up, and bind firmly; lay it in a kettle, cover it with vinegar and water (1/3 vinegar, in proportion to the water); add the bay-leaves and a good seasoning of salt and whole pepper, and simmer till done.
10136-8{_}4328{_}Do not remove the lid.
10136-8{_}4329{_}Serve with melted butter or anchovy sauce.
10136-8{_}4330{_}For preserving the collared fish, boil up the liquor in which it was cooked, and add a little more vinegar.
10136-8{_}4331{_}Pour over when cold.
10136-8{_}4332{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour, or rather more.
10136-8{_}4333{_}HABITAT OF THE SALMON.--The salmon is styled by Walton the "king     of fresh-water fish," and is found distributed over the north of     Europe and Asia, from Britain to Kamschatka, but is never found     in warm latitudes, nor has it ever been caught even so far south     as the Mediterranean.
10136-8{_}4334{_}It lives in fresh as well as in salt     waters, depositing its spawn in the former, hundreds of miles     from the mouths of some of those rivers to which it has been     known to resort.
10136-8{_}4335{_}In 1859, great efforts were made to introduce     this fish into the Australian colonies; and it is believed that     the attempt, after many difficulties, which were very skilfully     overcome, has been successful.
10136-8{_}4336{_}CRIMPED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4337{_}304.
10136-8{_}4338{_}Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at many fashionable tables, but must be very fresh, and cut into slices 2 or 3 inches thick.
10136-8{_}4339{_}Lay these in cold salt and water for 1 hour; have ready some boiling water, salted, as in recipe No.
10136-8{_}4340{_}301, and well skimmed; put in the fish, and simmer gently for 1/4 hour, or rather more; should it be very thick, garnish the same as boiled salmon, and serve with the same sauces.
10136-8{_}4341{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour, more or less, according to size.
10136-8{_}4342{_}_Note_.--Never use vinegar with salmon, as it spoils the taste and colour of the fish.
10136-8{_}4343{_}[Illustration: THE SALMON.]
10136-8{_}4344{_}THE SALMON TRIBE.--This is the Abdominal fish, forming the     fourth of the orders of Linnaeus.
10136-8{_}4345{_}They are distinguished from     the other fishes by having two dorsal fins, of which the     hindmost is fleshy and without rays.
10136-8{_}4346{_}They have teeth both on the     tongue and in the jaws, whilst the body is covered with round     and minutely striated scales.
10136-8{_}4347{_}CURRIED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4348{_}305.
10136-8{_}4349{_}INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of boiled salmon, 3/4 pint of strong or medium stock (No.
10136-8{_}4350{_}105), 1 onion, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}4351{_}of butter, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}4352{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the onions into small pieces, and fry them of a pale brown in the butter; add all the ingredients but the salmon, and simmer gently till the onion is tender, occasionally stirring the contents; cut the salmon into small square pieces, carefully take away all skin and bone, lay it in the stewpan, and let it gradually heat through; but do not allow it to boil long.
10136-8{_}4353{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}4354{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fish, 9d.
10136-8{_}4355{_}GROWTH OF THE SALMON.--At the latter end of the year--some as     soon as November--salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as     they can reach, in order to deposit their spawn, which they do     in the sand or gravel, about eighteen inches deep.
10136-8{_}4356{_}Here it lies     buried till the spring, when, about the latter end of March, it     begins to exclude the young, which gradually increase to four or     five inches in length, and are then termed smelts or smouts.
10136-8{_}4357{_}About the beginning of May, the river seems to be alive with     them, and there is no forming an idea of their numbers without     having seen them.
10136-8{_}4358{_}A seasonable flood, however, comes, and     hurries them to the "great deep;" whence, about the middle of     June, they commence their return to the river again.
10136-8{_}4359{_}By this     time they are twelve or sixteen inches long, and progressively     increase, both in number and size, till about the end of July,     when they have become large enough to be denominated _grilse_.
10136-8{_}4360{_}Early in August they become fewer in numbers, but of greater     size, haying advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds.
10136-8{_}4361{_}This rapidity of growth appears surprising, and realizes the     remark of Walton, that "the salmlet becomes a salmon in as short     a time as a gosling becomes a goose."
10136-8{_}4362{_}Recent writers have,     however, thrown considerable doubts on this quick growth of the     salmon.
10136-8{_}4363{_}SALMON CUTLETS.
10136-8{_}4364{_}306.
10136-8{_}4365{_}Cut the slices 1 inch thick, and season them with pepper and salt; butter a sheet of white paper, lay each slice on a separate piece, with their ends twisted; broil gently over a clear fire, and serve with anchovy or caper sauce.
10136-8{_}4366{_}When higher seasoning is required, add a few chopped herbs and a little spice.
10136-8{_}4367{_}_Time_.--5 to 10 minutes.

10136-8{_}4370{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 2 chopped shalots, a little parsley, a small bunch of herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 carrots, pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of Madeira, 1/2 pint of white stock (No.
10136-8{_}4371{_}107), thickening of butter and flour, 1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, the juice of 1 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}4372{_}_Mode_.--Rub the bottom of a stewpan over with butter, and put in the shalots, herbs, bay-leaves, carrots, mace, and seasoning; stir them for 10 minutes over a clear fire, and add the Madeira or sherry; simmer gently for 1/2 hour, and strain through a sieve over the fish, which stew in this gravy.
10136-8{_}4373{_}As soon as the fish is sufficiently cooked, take away all the liquor, except a little to keep the salmon moist, and put it into another stewpan; add the stock, thicken with butter and flour, and put in the anchovies, lemon-juice, cayenne, and salt; lay the salmon on a hot dish, pour over it part of the sauce, and serve the remainder in a tureen.
10136-8{_}4374{_}_Time_.--1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}4375{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s.
10136-8{_}4376{_}6d.
10136-8{_}4377{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4378{_}PICKLED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4379{_}308.
10136-8{_}4380{_}INGREDIENTS.--Salmon, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}4381{_}of whole pepper, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}4382{_}of whole allspice, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 bay-leaves, equal quantities of vinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled.
10136-8{_}4383{_}_Mode_.--After the fish comes from table, lay it in a nice dish with a cover to it, as it should be excluded from the air, and take away the bone; boil the liquor and vinegar with the other ingredients for 10 minutes, and let it stand to get cold; pour it over the salmon, and in 12 hours this will be fit for the table.
10136-8{_}4384{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}4385{_}TO CURE SALMON.--This process consists in splitting the fish,     rubbing it with salt, and then putting it into pickle in tubs     provided for the purpose.
10136-8{_}4386{_}Here it is kept for about six weeks,     when it is taken out, pressed and packed in casks, with layers     of salt.
10136-8{_}4387{_}POTTED SALMON.
10136-8{_}4388{_}309.
10136-8{_}4389{_}INGREDIENTS.--Salmon; pounded mace, cloves, and pepper to taste; 3 bay-leaves, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4390{_}butter.
10136-8{_}4391{_}_Mode_.--Skin the salmon, and clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth (water would spoil it); cut it into square pieces, which rub with salt; let them remain till thoroughly drained, then lay them in a dish with the other ingredients, and bake.
10136-8{_}4392{_}When quite done, drain them from the gravy, press into pots for use, and, when cold, pour over it clarified butter.
10136-8{_}4393{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4394{_}AN AVERSION IN THE SALMON.--The salmon is said to have an     aversion to anything red; hence, fishermen engaged in catching     it do not wear jackets or caps of that colour.
10136-8{_}4395{_}Pontoppidan also     says, that it has an abhorrence of carrion, and if any happens     to be thrown into the places it haunts, it immediately forsakes     them.
10136-8{_}4396{_}The remedy adopted for this in Norway, is to throw into     the polluted water a lighted torch.
10136-8{_}4397{_}As food, salmon, when in     perfection, is one of the most delicious and nutritive of our     fish.
10136-8{_}4398{_}BAKED SEA-BREAM.
10136-8{_}4399{_}310.
10136-8{_}4400{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 bream.
10136-8{_}4401{_}Seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and cayenne; 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4402{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}4403{_}_Mode_.--Well wash the bream, but do not remove the scales, and wipe away all moisture with a nice dry cloth.
10136-8{_}4404{_}Season it inside and out with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and lay it in a baking-dish.
10136-8{_}4405{_}Place the butter, in small pieces, upon the fish, and bake for rather more than 1/2 an hour.
10136-8{_}4406{_}To stuff this fish before baking, will be found a great improvement.
10136-8{_}4407{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 an hour.
10136-8{_}4408{_}_Seasonable_ in summer.
10136-8{_}4409{_}[Illustration: THE SEA-BREAM.]
10136-8{_}4410{_}_Note_.--This fish may be broiled over a nice clear fire, and served with a good brown gravy or white sauce, or it may be stewed in wine.
10136-8{_}4411{_}THE SEA-BREAM.--This is an abundant fish in Cornwall, and it is     frequently found in the fish-market of Hastings during the     summer months, but it is not in much esteem.
10136-8{_}4412{_}MR. YARRELL'S RECIPE.
10136-8{_}4413{_}"When thoroughly cleansed, the fish should be wiped dry, but     none of the scales should be taken off.
10136-8{_}4414{_}In this state it should     be broiled, turning it often, and if the skin cracks, flour it a     little to keep the outer case entire.
10136-8{_}4415{_}When on table, the whole     skin and scales turn off without difficulty, and the muscle     beneath, saturated in its own natural juices, which the outside     covering has retained, will be of good flavour."
10136-8{_}4416{_}TO DRESS SHAD.
10136-8{_}4417{_}311.
10136-8{_}4418{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 shad, oil, pepper, and salt.

10136-8{_}4420{_}Season it with pepper and salt, and let it remain in oil for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4421{_}Broil it on both sides over a clear fire, and serve with caper sauce.
10136-8{_}4422{_}This fish is much esteemed by the French, and by them is considered excellent.
10136-8{_}4423{_}_Time_.--Nearly 1 hour.
10136-8{_}4424{_}_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.
10136-8{_}4425{_}_Seasonable_ from April to June.
10136-8{_}4426{_}[Illustration: THE SHAD.]
10136-8{_}4427{_}THE SHAD.--This is a salt-water fish, but is held in little     esteem.
10136-8{_}4428{_}It enters our rivers to spawn in May, and great numbers     of them are taken opposite the Isle of Dogs, in the Thames.
10136-8{_}4429{_}POTTED SHRIMPS.
10136-8{_}4430{_}312.

10136-8{_}4447{_}4d.
10136-8{_}4448{_}[Illustration: THE SHRIMP.]
10136-8{_}4449{_}THE SHRIMP.--This shell-fish is smaller than the prawn, and is     greatly relished in London as a delicacy.
10136-8{_}4450{_}It inhabits most of     the sandy shores of Europe, and the Isle of Wight is especially     famous for them.
10136-8{_}4451{_}BOILED SKATE.
10136-8{_}4452{_}314.
10136-8{_}4453{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}4454{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}4455{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse and skin the skate, lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient water to cover it, salted in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}4456{_}Let it simmer very gently till done; then dish it on a hot napkin, and serve with shrimp, lobster, or caper sauce.

10136-8{_}4463{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/8 lb.
10136-8{_}4464{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}4465{_}_Mode_.--Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices, which roll and tie round with string.
10136-8{_}4466{_}Have ready some water highly salted, put in the fish, and boil till it is done.
10136-8{_}4467{_}Drain well, remove the string, dish on a hot napkin, and serve with the same sauces as above.
10136-8{_}4468{_}Skate should never be eaten out of season, as it is liable to produce diarrhoea and other diseases.
10136-8{_}4469{_}It may be dished without a napkin, and the sauce poured over.
10136-8{_}4470{_}_Time_.--About 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}4471{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}4472{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}4473{_}_Seasonable_ from August to April.
10136-8{_}4474{_}TO CHOOSE SKATE.--This fish should be chosen for its firmness, breadth, and thickness, and should have a creamy appearance.
10136-8{_}4475{_}When crimped, it should not be kept longer than a day or two, as all kinds of crimped fish soon become sour.
10136-8{_}4476{_}[Illustration: THORNBACK SKATE.]
10136-8{_}4477{_}THE SKATE.--This is one of the ray tribe, and is extremely     abundant and cheap in the fishing towns of England.
10136-8{_}4478{_}The flesh is     white, thick, and nourishing; but, we suppose, from its being so     plentiful, it is esteemed less than it ought to be on account of     its nutritive properties, and the ease with which it is     digested.
10136-8{_}4479{_}It is much improved by crimping; in which state it is     usually sold in London.
10136-8{_}4480{_}The THORNBACK differs from the true     skate by having large spines in its back, of which the other is     destitute.
10136-8{_}4481{_}It is taken in great abundance during the spring and     summer months, but its flesh is not so good as it is in     November.
10136-8{_}4482{_}It is, in regard to quality, inferior to that of the     true skate.
10136-8{_}4483{_}SKATE WITH CAPER SAUCE (a la Francaise)  316.
10136-8{_}4484{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 slices of skate, 1/2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}4485{_}of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley, 2 bay-leaves, 2 or 3 sprigs of thyme, sufficient water to cover the fish.
10136-8{_}4486{_}_Mode_.--Put in a fish-kettle all the above ingredients, and simmer the skate in them till tender.
10136-8{_}4487{_}When it is done, skin it neatly, and pour over it some of the liquor in which it has been boiling.
10136-8{_}4488{_}Drain it, put it on a hot dish, pour over it caper sauce, and send some of the latter to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}4489{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}4494{_}SMALL SKATE FRIED.
10136-8{_}4495{_}317.
10136-8{_}4496{_}INGREDIENTS.--Skate, sufficient vinegar to cover them, salt and pepper to taste, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley, the juice of 1/2 lemon, hot dripping.
10136-8{_}4497{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the skate, lay them in a dish, with sufficient vinegar to cover them; add the salt, pepper, onion, parsley, and lemon-juice, and let the fish remain in this pickle for 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4498{_}Then drain them well, flour them, and fry of a nice brown, in hot dripping.
10136-8{_}4499{_}They may be served either with or without sauce.
10136-8{_}4500{_}Skate is not good if dressed too fresh, unless it is crimped; it should, therefore, be kept for a day, but not long enough to produce a disagreeable smell.
10136-8{_}4501{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}4502{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}4503{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}4504{_}_Seasonable_ from August to April.
10136-8{_}4505{_}OTHER SPECIES OF SKATE.--Besides the true skate, there are     several other species found in our seas.
10136-8{_}4506{_}These are known as the     _white_ skate, the long-nosed skate, and the Homelyn ray, which     are of inferior quality, though often crimped, and sold for true     skate.
10136-8{_}4507{_}TO BAKE SMELTS.
10136-8{_}4508{_}318.

10136-8{_}4512{_}Cover them with fine bread crumbs, and place little pieces of butter all over them.
10136-8{_}4513{_}Season and bake for 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}4514{_}Just before serving, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon.

10136-8{_}4517{_}per dozen.
10136-8{_}4518{_}_Seasonable_ from October to May.
10136-8{_}4519{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}4520{_}TO CHOOSE SMELTS.--When good, this fish is of a fine silvery appearance, and when alive, their backs are of a dark brown shade, which, after death, fades to a light fawn.
10136-8{_}4521{_}They ought to have a refreshing fragrance, resembling that of a cucumber.
10136-8{_}4522{_}THE ODOUR OF THE SMELT.--This peculiarity in the smelt has been     compared, by some, to the fragrance of a cucumber, and by     others, to that of a violet.
10136-8{_}4523{_}It is a very elegant fish, and     formerly abounded in the Thames.
10136-8{_}4524{_}The _Atharine_, or sand smelt,     is sometimes sold for the true one; but it is an inferior fish,     being drier in the quality of its flesh.
10136-8{_}4525{_}On the south coast of     England, where the true smelt is rare, it is plentiful.
10136-8{_}4526{_}TO FRY SMELTS.
10136-8{_}4527{_}319.
10136-8{_}4528{_}INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour; boiling lard.
10136-8{_}4529{_}_Mode_.--Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more than is necessary to clean them.
10136-8{_}4530{_}Dry them in a cloth, lightly flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle over with very fine bread crumbs, and put them into boiling lard.
10136-8{_}4531{_}Fry of a nice pale brown, and be careful not to take off the light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled.
10136-8{_}4532{_}Dry them before the fire on a drainer, and servo with plain melted butter.
10136-8{_}4533{_}This fish is often used as a garnishing.

10136-8{_}4538{_}[Illustration: THE SMELT.]
10136-8{_}4539{_}THE SMELT.--This is a delicate little fish, and is in high     esteem.
10136-8{_}4540{_}Mr. Yarrell asserts that the true smelt is entirety     confined to the western and eastern coasts of Britain.
10136-8{_}4541{_}It very     rarely ventures far from the shore, and is plentiful in     November, December, and January.

10136-8{_}4546{_}_Mode_.--Clean, skin, and well wash the fish, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth.
10136-8{_}4547{_}Brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley, lay them in a large flat baking-dish, white side uppermost; or if it will not hold the two soles, they may each be laid on a dish by itself; but they must not be put one on the top of the other.
10136-8{_}4548{_}Melt the butter, and pour it over the whole, and bake for 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}4549{_}Take a portion of the gravy that flows from the fish, add the wine, lemon-juice, and seasoning, give it one boil, skim, pour it _under_ the fish, and serve.

10136-8{_}4555{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4556{_}TO CHOOSE SOLES.--This fish should be both thick and firm.
10136-8{_}4557{_}If the skin is difficult to be taken off, and the flesh looks grey, it is good.
10136-8{_}4558{_}[Illustration: THE SOLE.]
10136-8{_}4559{_}THE SOLE.--This ranks next to the turbot in point of excellence     among our flat fish.
10136-8{_}4560{_}It is abundant on the British coasts, but     those of the western shores are much superior in size to those     taken on the northern.

10136-8{_}4595{_}The fillets may be rolled, and secured by means of a skewer; but this is not so economical a way of dressing them, as double the quantity of cream is required.
10136-8{_}4596{_}_Time_.--10 minutes in the cream.
10136-8{_}4597{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}4598{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}4599{_}per pair.
10136-8{_}4600{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4601{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4602{_}This will be found a most delicate and delicious dish.
10136-8{_}4603{_}THE SOLE A FAVOURITE WITH THE ANCIENT GREEKS.--This fish was     much sought after by the ancient Greeks on account of its light     and nourishing qualities.
10136-8{_}4604{_}The brill, the flounder, the diamond     and Dutch plaice, which, with the sole, were known under the     general name of _passeres_, were all equally esteemed, and had     generally the same qualities attributed to them.
10136-8{_}4605{_}FILLETED SOLES A L'ITALIENNE.
10136-8{_}4606{_}324.
10136-8{_}4607{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 soles; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste; egg and bread crumbs, butter, the juice of 1 lemon.
10136-8{_}4608{_}_Mode_.--Skin, and carefully wash the soles, separate the meat from the bone, and divide each fillet in two pieces.
10136-8{_}4609{_}Brush them over with white of egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and seasoning, and put them in a baking-dish.
10136-8{_}4610{_}Place small pieces of butter over the whole, and bake for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4611{_}When they are nearly done, squeeze the juice of a lemon over them, and serve on a dish, with Italian sauce (see Sauces) poured over.
10136-8{_}4612{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4613{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}4614{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}4615{_}per pair.
10136-8{_}4616{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4617{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}4618{_}WHITING may be dressed in the same manner, and will be found very delicious.
10136-8{_}4619{_}THE FLAVOUR OF THE SOLE.--This, as a matter of course, greatly     depends on the nature of the ground and bait upon which the     animal feeds.
10136-8{_}4620{_}Its natural food are small crabs and shell-fish.
10136-8{_}4621{_}Its colour also depends on the colour of the ground where it     feeds; for if this be white, then the sole is called the white,     or lemon sole; but if the bottom be muddy, then it is called the     black sole.
10136-8{_}4622{_}Small-sized soles, caught in shallow water on the     coasts, are the best in flavour.
10136-8{_}4623{_}FRICASSEED SOLES.
10136-8{_}4624{_}325.
10136-8{_}4625{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized soles, 1 small one, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a little grated bread; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste; 1 egg, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}4626{_}butter, 1/2 pint of good gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, cayenne and lemon-juice to taste.
10136-8{_}4627{_}_Mode_.--Fry the soles of a nice brown, as directed in recipe No.
10136-8{_}4628{_}327, and drain them well from fat.
10136-8{_}4629{_}Take all the meat from the small sole, chop it fine, and mix with it the lemon-peel, parsley, bread, and seasoning; work altogether, with the yolk of an egg and the butter; make this into small balls, and fry them.
10136-8{_}4630{_}Thicken the gravy with a dessert-spoonful of flour, add the port wine, cayenne, and lemon-juice; lay in the 2 soles and balls; let them simmer gently for 6 minutes; serve hot, and garnish with cut lemon.
10136-8{_}4631{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the soles.
10136-8{_}4632{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s.
10136-8{_}4633{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4634{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4635{_}HOW SOLES ARE CAUGHT.--The instrument usually employed is a     trawl net, which is shaped like a pocket, of from sixty to     eighty feet long, and open at the mouth from thirty-two to forty     feet, and three deep.
10136-8{_}4636{_}This is dragged along the ground by the     vessel, and on the art of the fisherman in its employment, in a     great measure depends the quality of the fish he catches.
10136-8{_}4637{_}If,     for example, he drags the net too quickly, all that are caught     are swept rapidly to the end of the net, where they are     smothered, and sometimes destroyed.
10136-8{_}4638{_}A medium has to be observed,     in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net,     and as many as possible preserved alive in it.
10136-8{_}4639{_}FRIED FILLETED SOLES.
10136-8{_}4640{_}326.
10136-8{_}4641{_}Soles for filleting should be large, as the flesh can be more easily separated from the bones, and there is less waste.
10136-8{_}4642{_}Skin and wash the fish, and raise the meat carefully from the bones, and divide it into nice handsome pieces.
10136-8{_}4643{_}The more usual way is to roll the fillets, after dividing each one in two pieces, and either bind them round with twine, or run a small skewer through them.
10136-8{_}4644{_}Brush over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs; fry them as directed in the foregoing recipe, and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon.
10136-8{_}4645{_}When a pretty dish is desired, this is by far the most elegant mode of dressing soles, as they look much better than when fried whole.
10136-8{_}4646{_}(_See_ Coloured Plate A.)
10136-8{_}4647{_}Instead of rolling the fillets, they may be cut into square pieces, and arranged in the shape of a pyramid on the dish.
10136-8{_}4648{_}_Time_.--About 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}4649{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}4650{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}4651{_}per pair.
10136-8{_}4652{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4653{_}_Sufficient_,--2 large soles for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}4654{_}FRIED SOLES.
10136-8{_}4655{_}327.
10136-8{_}4656{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized soles, hot lard or clarified dripping, egg, and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}4657{_}_Mode_.--Skin and carefully wash the soles, and cut off the fins, wipe them very dry, and let them remain in the cloth until it is time to dress them.
10136-8{_}4658{_}Have ready some fine bread crumbs and beaten egg; dredge the soles with a little flour, brush them over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}4659{_}Put them in a deep pan, with plenty of clarified dripping or lard (when the expense is not objected to, oil is still better) heated, so that it may neither scorch the fish nor make them sodden.
10136-8{_}4660{_}When they are sufficiently cooked on one side, turn them carefully, and brown them on the other: they may be considered ready when a thick smoke rises.
10136-8{_}4661{_}Lift them out carefully, and lay them before the fire on a reversed sieve and soft paper, to absorb the fat.
10136-8{_}4662{_}Particular attention should be paid to this, as nothing is more disagreeable than greasy fish: this may be always avoided by dressing them in good time, and allowing a few minutes for them to get thoroughly crisp, and free from greasy moisture.
10136-8{_}4663{_}Dish them on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and fried parsley, and send them to table with shrimp sauce and plain melted butter.
10136-8{_}4664{_}_Time_.--10 minutes for large soles; less time for small ones.
10136-8{_}4665{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}4666{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}4667{_}per pair.

10136-8{_}4669{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}4670{_}SOLES WITH MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}4671{_}328.
10136-8{_}4672{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}4673{_}butter, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}4674{_}salt, a little lemon-juice, 2 middling-sized soles.
10136-8{_}4675{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the soles, but do not skin them, and lay them in a fish-kettle, with the milk, water, butter, salt, and lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}4676{_}Bring them gradually to boil, and let them simmer very gently till done, which will be in about 7 minutes.
10136-8{_}4677{_}Take them up, drain them well on a cloth, put them on a hot dish, and pour over them a good mushroom sauce.
10136-8{_}4678{_}(_See_ Sauces.)
10136-8{_}4679{_}_Time_.--After the water boils, 7 minutes.
10136-8{_}4680{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}4682{_}SPRATS.
10136-8{_}4683{_}329.
10136-8{_}4684{_}Sprats should be cooked very fresh, which can be ascertained by their bright and sparkling eyes.
10136-8{_}4685{_}Wipe them dry; fasten them in rows by a skewer run through the eyes; dredge with flour, and broil them on a gridiron over a nice clear fire.
10136-8{_}4686{_}The gridiron should be rubbed with suet.
10136-8{_}4687{_}Serve very hot.
10136-8{_}4688{_}_Time_,--3 or 4 minutes.
10136-8{_}4689{_}_Average cost_, 1d.

10136-8{_}4691{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}4692{_}TO CHOOSE SPRATS.--Choose these from their silvery appearance, as the brighter they are, so are they the fresher.
10136-8{_}4693{_}SPRATS FRIED IN BATTER.
10136-8{_}4694{_}330.
10136-8{_}4695{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, flour, bread crumbs; seasoning of salt and pepper to taste.

10136-8{_}4701{_}DRIED SPRATS.
10136-8{_}4702{_}331.
10136-8{_}4703{_}Dried sprats should be put into a basin, and boiling water poured over them; they may then be skinned and served, and this will be found a much better way than boiling them.
10136-8{_}4704{_}[Illustration: THE SPRAT.]
10136-8{_}4705{_}THE SPRAT.--This migratory fish, is rarely found longer than     four or five inches, and visits the shores of Britain after the     herring and other kinds of fish have taken their departure from     them.
10136-8{_}4706{_}On the coasts of Suffolk, Essex, and Kent, they are very     abundant, and from 400 to 500 boats are employed in catching     them during the winter season.
10136-8{_}4707{_}Besides plentifully supplying the     London market, they are frequently sold at sixpence a bushel to     farmers for manuring purposes.
10136-8{_}4708{_}They enter the Thames about the     beginning of November, and leave it in March.
10136-8{_}4709{_}At Yarmouth and     Gravesend they are cured like red herrings.

10136-8{_}4722{_}[Illustration: THE STURGEON.]
10136-8{_}4723{_}THE STURGEON.--This fish commences the sixth of Linnaean order,     and all the species are large, seldom measuring, when     full-grown, less than three or four feet in length.
10136-8{_}4724{_}Its flesh is     reckoned extremely delicious, and, in the time of the emperor     Severus, was so highly valued by the ancients, that it was     brought to table by servants crowned with coronets, and preceded     by a band of music.
10136-8{_}4725{_}It is an inhabitant of the Baltic, the     Mediterranean, the Caspian, and the Black Sea, and of the     Danube, the Volga, the Don, and other large rivers.
10136-8{_}4726{_}It is     abundant in the rivers of North America, and is occasionally     taken in the Thames, as well as in the Eske and the Eden.
10136-8{_}4727{_}It is     one of those fishes considered as royal property.
10136-8{_}4728{_}It is from its     _roe_ that _caviare_, a favourite food of the Russians, is     prepared.
10136-8{_}4729{_}Its flesh is delicate, firm, and white, but is rare in     the London market, where it sells for 1s.

10136-8{_}4733{_}THE STERLET is a smaller species of sturgeon, found in the     Caspian Sea and some Russian rivers.
10136-8{_}4734{_}It also is greatly prized     on account of the delicacy of its flesh.
10136-8{_}4735{_}ROAST STURGEON.
10136-8{_}4736{_}333.
10136-8{_}4737{_}INGREDIENTS.--Veal stuffing, buttered paper, the tail-end of a sturgeon.
10136-8{_}4738{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish, bone and skin it; make a nice veal stuffing (see Forcemeats), and fill it with the part where the bones came from; roll it in buttered paper, bind it up firmly with tape, like a fillet of veal, and roast it in a Dutch oven before a clear fire.
10136-8{_}4739{_}Serve with good brown gravy, or plain melted butter.

10136-8{_}4746{_}_Note_.--Sturgeon may be plain-boiled, and served with Dutch sauce.
10136-8{_}4747{_}The fish is very firm, and requires long boiling.
10136-8{_}4748{_}ESTIMATE OF THE STURGEON BY THE ANCIENTS.--By the ancients, the     flesh of this fish was compared to the ambrosia of the     immortals.
10136-8{_}4749{_}The poet Martial passes a high eulogium upon it, and     assigns it a place on the luxurious tables of the Palatine     Mount.
10136-8{_}4750{_}If we may credit a modern traveller in China, the people     of that country generally entirely abstain from it, and the     sovereign of the Celestial Empire confines it to his own     kitchen, or dispenses it to only a few of his greatest     favourites.
10136-8{_}4751{_}MATELOT OF TENCH.

10136-8{_}4756{_}105, flour, 1 dozen oysters, the juice of 1/2 lemon; the number of tench, according to size.
10136-8{_}4757{_}_Mode_.--Scale and clean the tench, cut them into pieces, and lay them in a stewpan; add the stock, wine, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and mace, and simmer gently for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4758{_}Put into another stewpan all the remaining ingredients but the oysters and lemon-juice, and boil slowly for 10 minutes, when add the strained liquor from the tench, and keep stirring it over the fire until somewhat reduced.
10136-8{_}4759{_}Rub it through a sieve, pour it over the tench with the oysters, which must be previously scalded in their own liquor, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve.

10136-8{_}4764{_}[Illustration: THE TENCH.]
10136-8{_}4765{_}THE TENCH.--This fish is generally found in foul and weedy     waters, and in such places as are well supplied with rushes.
10136-8{_}4766{_}They thrive best in standing waters, and are more numerous in     pools and ponds than in rivers.
10136-8{_}4767{_}Those taken in the latter,     however, are preferable for the table.
10136-8{_}4768{_}It does not often exceed     four or five pounds in weight, and is in England esteemed as a     delicious and wholesome food.
10136-8{_}4769{_}As, however, they are sometimes     found in waters where the mud is excessively fetid, their     flavour, if cooked immediately on being caught, is often very     unpleasant; but if they are transferred into clear water, they     soon recover from the obnoxious taint.
10136-8{_}4770{_}TENCH STEWED WITH WINE.
10136-8{_}4771{_}335.
10136-8{_}4772{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}4773{_}105, 1/2 pint of Madeira or sherry, salt and pepper to taste, 1 bay-leaf, thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}4774{_}_Mode_.--Clean and crimp the tench; carefully lay it in a stewpan with the stock, wine, salt and pepper, and bay-leaf; let it stew gently for 1/2 hour; then take it out, put it on a dish, and keep hot.
10136-8{_}4775{_}Strain the liquor, and thicken it with butter and flour kneaded together, and stew for 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}4776{_}If not perfectly smooth, squeeze it through a tammy, add a very little cayenne, and pour over the fish.
10136-8{_}4777{_}Garnish with balls of veal forcemeat.
10136-8{_}4778{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4779{_}_Seasonable_ from October to June.
10136-8{_}4780{_}A SINGULAR QUALITY IN THE TENCH.--It is said that the tench is     possessed of such healing properties among the finny tribes,     that even the voracious pike spares it on this account.
10136-8{_}4781{_}The pike, fell tyrant of the liquid plain,       With ravenous waste devours his fellow train;       Yet howsoe'er with raging famine pined,       The tench he spares, a medicinal kind;       For when by wounds distress'd, or sore disease,       He courts the salutary fish for ease;       Close to his scales the kind physician glides,       And sweats a healing balsam from his sides.
10136-8{_}4782{_}In our estimation, however, this self-denial in the pike may be     attributed to a less poetical cause; namely, from the mud-loving     disposition of the tench, it is enabled to keep itself so     completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts, that     it remains secure from the attacks of its predatory neighbour.
10136-8{_}4783{_}STEWED TROUT.

10136-8{_}4788{_}Lay it in a stewpan, with all the ingredients but the butter and flour, and simmer gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, should not the fish be quite done.
10136-8{_}4789{_}Take it out, strain the gravy, add the thickening, and stir it over a sharp fire for 5 minutes; pour it over the trout, and serve.

10136-8{_}4797{_}[Illustration: THE TROUT.]
10136-8{_}4798{_}THE TROUT.--This fish, though esteemed by the moderns for its     delicacy, was little regarded by the ancients.
10136-8{_}4799{_}Although it     abounded in the lakes of the Roman empire, it is generally     mentioned by writers only on account of the beauty of its     colours.
10136-8{_}4800{_}About the end of September, they quit the deep water to     which they had retired during the hot weather, for the purpose     of spawning.
10136-8{_}4801{_}This they always do on a gravelly bottom, or where     gravel and sand are mixed among stones, towards the end or by     the sides of streams.
10136-8{_}4802{_}At this period they become black about the     head and body, and become soft and unwholesome.
10136-8{_}4803{_}They are never     good when they are large with roe; but there are in all trout     rivers some barren female fish, which continue good throughout     the winter.
10136-8{_}4804{_}In the common trout, the stomach is uncommonly     strong and muscular, shell-fish forming a portion of the food of     the animal; and it takes into its stomach gravel or small stones     in order to assist in comminuting it.
10136-8{_}4805{_}BOILED TURBOT.
10136-8{_}4806{_}337.
10136-8{_}4807{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 oz.
10136-8{_}4808{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}4809{_}_Mode_--Choose a middling-sized turbot; for they are invariably the most valuable: if very large, the meat will be tough and thready.
10136-8{_}4810{_}Three or four hours before dressing, soak the fish in salt and water to take off the slime; then thoroughly cleanse it, and with a knife make an incision down the middle of the back, to prevent the skin of the belly from cracking.
10136-8{_}4811{_}Rub it over with lemon, and be particular not to cut off the fins.
10136-8{_}4812{_}Lay the fish in a very clean turbot-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and salt in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}4813{_}Let it gradually come to a boil, and skim very carefully; keep it gently simmering, and on no account let it boil fast, as the fish would have a very unsightly appearance.
10136-8{_}4814{_}When the meat separates easily from the bone, it is done; then take it out, let it drain well, and dish it on a hot napkin.
10136-8{_}4815{_}Rub a little lobster spawn through a sieve, sprinkle it over the fish, and garnish with tufts of parsley and cut lemon.
10136-8{_}4816{_}Lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter, should be sent to table with it.
10136-8{_}4817{_}(See Coloured Plate E.)  _Time_.--After the water boils, about 1/2 hour for a large turbot; middling size, about 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}4818{_}_Average cost_,--large turbot, from 10s.
10136-8{_}4819{_}to 12s.
10136-8{_}4820{_}; middling size, from 12s.
10136-8{_}4821{_}to 15s.
10136-8{_}4822{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4823{_}_Sufficient_, 1 middling-sized turbot for 8 persons.
10136-8{_}4824{_}_Note_.--An amusing anecdote is related, by Miss Edgeworth, of a bishop, who, descending to his kitchen to superintend the dressing of a turbot, and discovering that his cook had stupidly cut off the fins, immediately commenced sewing them on again with his own episcopal fingers.
10136-8{_}4825{_}This dignitary knew the value of a turbot's gelatinous appendages.
10136-8{_}4826{_}GARNISH FOR TURBOT OR OTHER LARGE FISH.
10136-8{_}4827{_}338.
10136-8{_}4828{_}Take the crumb of a stale loaf, cut it into small pyramids with flat tops, and on the top of each pyramid, put rather more than a tablespoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth.
10136-8{_}4829{_}Over this, sprinkle finely-chopped parsley and fine raspings of a dark colour.
10136-8{_}4830{_}Arrange these on the napkin round the fish, one green and one brown alternately.
10136-8{_}4831{_}TO CHOOSE TURBOT.--See that it is thick, and of a yellowish white; for if of a bluish tint, it is not good.
10136-8{_}4832{_}[Illustration: THE TURBOT.]
10136-8{_}4833{_}THE TURBOT.--This is the most esteemed of all our flat fish.
10136-8{_}4834{_}The     northern parts of the English coast, and some places off the     coast of Holland, produce turbot in great abundance, and in     greater excellence than any other parts of the world.
10136-8{_}4835{_}The London     market is chiefly supplied by Dutch fishermen, who bring to it     nearly 90,000 a year.
10136-8{_}4836{_}The flesh is firm, white, rich, and     gelatinous, and is the better for being kept a day or two     previous to cooking it.
10136-8{_}4837{_}In many parts of the country, turbot and     halibut are indiscriminately sold for each other.
10136-8{_}4838{_}They are,     however, perfectly distinct; the upper parts of the former being     marked with large, unequal, and obtuse tubercles, while those of     the other are quite smooth, and covered with oblong soft scales,     which firmly adhere to the body.
10136-8{_}4839{_}[Illustration: TURBOT-KETTLE.]
10136-8{_}4840{_}FISH-KETTLES are made in an oblong form, and have two handles,     with a movable bottom, pierced full of holes, on which the fish     is laid, and on which it may be lifted from the water, by means     of two long handles attached to each side of the movable bottom.
10136-8{_}4841{_}This is to prevent the liability of breaking the fish, as it     would necessarily be if it were cooked in a common saucepan.
10136-8{_}4842{_}In     the list of Messrs. Richard and John Slack (see 71), the price     of two of these is set down at 10s.
10136-8{_}4843{_}The turbot-kettle, as will     be seen by our cut, is made differently from ordinary     fish-kettles, it being less deep, whilst it is wider, and more     pointed at the sides; thus exactly answering to the shape of the     fish which it is intended should be boiled in it.
10136-8{_}4844{_}It may be     obtained from the same manufacturers, and its price is £1.
10136-8{_}4845{_}BAKED FILLETS OF TURBOT.
10136-8{_}4846{_}339.
10136-8{_}4847{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, lobster sauce left from the preceding day, egg, and bread crumbs; cayenne and salt to taste; minced parsley, nutmeg, lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}4848{_}_Mode_.--After having cleared the fish from all skin and bone, divide it into square pieces of an equal size; brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley and seasoning.
10136-8{_}4849{_}Lay the fillets in a baking-dish, with sufficient butter to baste with.
10136-8{_}4850{_}Bake for 1/4 hour, and do not forget to keep them well moistened with the butter.
10136-8{_}4851{_}Put a little lemon-juice and grated nutmeg to the cold lobster sauce; make it hot, and pour over the fish, which must be well drained from the butter.
10136-8{_}4852{_}Garnish with parsley and cut lemon.
10136-8{_}4853{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4854{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4855{_}_Note_.--Cold turbot thus warmed in the remains of lobster sauce will be found much nicer than putting the fish again in water.
10136-8{_}4856{_}FILLETS OF TURBOT A L'ITALIENNE.
10136-8{_}4857{_}340.
10136-8{_}4858{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, Italian sauce.
10136-8{_}4859{_}(See Sauces.)
10136-8{_}4860{_}_Mode_.--Clear the fish carefully from the bone, and take away all skin, which gives an unpleasant flavour to the sauce.
10136-8{_}4861{_}Make the sauce hot, lay in the fish to warm through, but do not let it boil.
10136-8{_}4862{_}Garnish with croutons.
10136-8{_}4863{_}_Time_.--5 minutes.
10136-8{_}4864{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}4865{_}THE ANCIENT ROMANS' ESTIMATE OF TURBOT.--As this luxurious     people compared soles to partridges, and sturgeons to peacocks,     so they found a resemblance to the turbot in the pheasant.
10136-8{_}4866{_}In     the time of Domitian, it is said one was taken of such     dimensions as to require, in the imperial kitchen, a new stove     to be erected, and a new dish to be made for it, in order that     it might be cooked and served whole: not even imperial Rome     could furnish a stove or a dish large enough for the monstrous     animal.
10136-8{_}4867{_}Where it was caught, we are not aware; but the turbot of     the Adriatic Sea held a high rank in the "Eternal City."
10136-8{_}4868{_}TURBOT A LA CREME.
10136-8{_}4869{_}341.
10136-8{_}4870{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot.
10136-8{_}4871{_}For sauce, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}4872{_}of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste.
10136-8{_}4873{_}_Mode_.--Clear away all skin and bone from the flesh of the turbot, which should be done when it comes from table, as it causes less waste when trimmed hot.
10136-8{_}4874{_}Cut the flesh into nice square pieces, as equally as possible; put into a stewpan the butter, let it melt, and add the cream and seasoning; let it just simmer for one minute, but not boil.
10136-8{_}4875{_}Lay in the fish to warm, and serve it garnished with croutons or a paste border.
10136-8{_}4876{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}4877{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}4878{_}_Note_.--The remains of cold salmon may be dressed in this way, and the above mixture may be served in a _vol-au-vent_.
10136-8{_}4879{_}TURBOT AU GRATIN.

10136-8{_}4885{_}Spread the mixture on a dish, cover with finely-grated bread crumbs, and place small pieces of butter over the top.
10136-8{_}4886{_}Brown it in the oven, or with a salamander.
10136-8{_}4887{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}4888{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}4892{_}of salt to each gallon of water.
10136-8{_}4893{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish, but do not skin them; lay them in a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover them, and salt in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}4894{_}Bring them gradually to a boil, and simmer gently for about 5 minutes, or rather more should the fish be very large.

10136-8{_}4901{_}_Sufficient_, 1 small whiting for each person.
10136-8{_}4902{_}To CHOOSE WHITING.--Choose for the firmness of its flesh and the silvery hue of its appearance.
10136-8{_}4903{_}[Illustration: THE WHITING.]
10136-8{_}4904{_}The Whiting.--This fish forms a light, tender, and delicate     food, easy of digestion.
10136-8{_}4905{_}It appears in our seas in the spring,     within three miles of the shores, where it arrives in large     shoals to deposit its spawn.
10136-8{_}4906{_}It is caught by line, and is     usually between ten and twelve inches long, and seldom exceeding     a pound and a half in weight.
10136-8{_}4907{_}On the edge of the Dogger Bank,     however, it has been caught so heavy as to weigh from three to     seven or eight pounds.
10136-8{_}4908{_}When less than six inches long, it is not     allowed to be caught.

10136-8{_}4961{_}THE WHITING POUT, AND POLLACK.--About the mouth of the Thames,     and generally all round the English coasts, as well as in the     northern seas, the pout is plentiful.
10136-8{_}4962{_}It bears a striking     resemblance to the whiting, and is esteemed as an excellent     fish.--The _pollack_ is also taken all round our coasts, and     likewise bears a striking resemblance to the whiting; indeed, it     is sometimes mistaken by the inexperienced for that fish; its     flesh being considered by many equally delicate.
10136-8{_}4963{_}TO DRESS WHITEBAIT.
10136-8{_}4964{_}348.
10136-8{_}4965{_}INGREDIENTS.--A little flour, hot lard, seasoning of salt.

10136-8{_}4974{_}[Illustration: WHITEBAIT.]
10136-8{_}4975{_}WHITEBAIT.--This highly-esteemed little fish appears in     innumerable multitudes in the river Thames, near Greenwich and     Blackwall, during the month of July, when it forms, served with     lemon and brown bread and butter, a tempting dish to vast     numbers of Londoners, who flock to the various taverns of these     places, in order to gratify their appetites.
10136-8{_}4976{_}The fish has been     supposed be the fry of the shad, the sprat, the smelt, or the     bleak.
10136-8{_}4977{_}Mr. Yarrell, however, maintains that it is a species in     itself, distinct from every other fish.
10136-8{_}4978{_}When fried with flour,     it is esteemed a great delicacy.
10136-8{_}4979{_}The ministers of the Crown have     had a custom, for many years, of having a "whitebait dinner"     just before the close of the session.
10136-8{_}4980{_}It is invariably the     precursor of the prorogation of Parliament, and the repast is     provided by the proprietor of the "Trafalgar," Greenwich.

10136-8{_}5008{_}For the souchy, put some water into a stewpan with a bunch of chopped parsley, some roots, and sufficient salt to make it brackish.
10136-8{_}5009{_}Let these simmer for 1 hour, and then stew the fish in this water.
10136-8{_}5010{_}When they are done, take them out to drain, have ready some finely-chopped parsley, and a few roots cut into slices of about one inch thick and an inch in length.
10136-8{_}5011{_}Put the fish in a tureen or deep dish, strain the liquor over them, and add the minced parsley and roots.

10136-8{_}5026{_}ADDENDUM AND ANECDOTE.
10136-8{_}5027{_}It will be seen, from the number and variety of the recipes which we have been enabled to give under the head of FISH, that there exists in the salt ocean, and fresh-water rivers, an abundance of aliment, which the present state of gastronomic art enables the cook to introduce to the table in the most agreeable forms, and oftentimes at a very moderate cost.
10136-8{_}5028{_}Less nutritious as a food than the flesh of animals, more succulent than vegetables, fish may be termed a middle dish, suited to all temperaments and constitutions; and one which those who are recovering from illness may partake of with safety and advantage.
10136-8{_}5029{_}As to which is the best fish, there has been much discussion.
10136-8{_}5030{_}The old Latin proverb, however, _de gustibus non disputandum_, and the more modern Spanish one, _sobre los gustos no hai disputa_, declare, with equal force, that where _taste_ is concerned, no decision can be arrived at.
10136-8{_}5031{_}Each person's palate may be differently affected--pleased or displeased; and there is no standard by which to judge why a red mullet, a sole, or a turbot, should be better or worse than a salmon, trout, pike, or a tiny tench.
10136-8{_}5032{_}Fish, as we have explained, is less nourishing than meat; for it is lighter in weight, size for size, and contains no ozmazome (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}5033{_}100).
10136-8{_}5034{_}Shell-fish, oysters particularly, furnish but little nutriment; and this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without injury to the system.
10136-8{_}5035{_}In Brillat Savarin's [Footnote: Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and judge of considerable eminence and great talents, and wrote, under the above title, a book on gastronomy, full of instructive information, enlivened with a fund of pleasantly-told anecdote.]
10136-8{_}5036{_}clever and amusing volume, "The Physiology of Taste," he says, that towards the end of the eighteenth century it was a most common thing for a well-arranged entertainment in Paris to commence with oysters, and that many guests were not contented without swallowing twelve dozen.
10136-8{_}5037{_}Being anxious to know the weight of this advanced-guard, he ascertained that a dozen oysters, fluid included, weighed 4 ounces,--thus, the twelve dozen would weigh about 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}5038{_}; and there can be no doubt, that the same persons who made no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters, would have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight of chicken or mutton.
10136-8{_}5039{_}An anecdote, perfectly well authenticated, is narrated of a French gentleman (M. Laperte), residing at Versailles, who was extravagantly fond of oysters, declaring he never had enough.
10136-8{_}5040{_}Savarin resolved to procure him the satisfaction, and gave him an invitation to dinner, which was duly accepted.
10136-8{_}5041{_}The guest arrived, and his host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up to the tenth dozen, when, exhausted, he gave up, and let M. Laperte go on alone.
10136-8{_}5042{_}This gentleman managed to eat thirty-two dozen within an hour, and would doubtless have got through more, but the person who opened them is described as not being very skilful.
10136-8{_}5043{_}In the interim Savarin was idle, and at length, tired with his painful state of inaction, he said to Laperte, whilst the latter was still in full career, "Mon cher, you will not eat as many oysters to-day as you meant; let us dine."
10136-8{_}5044{_}They dined, and the insatiable oyster-eater acted at the repast as if he had fasted for a week.
10136-8{_}5045{_}FISH CARVING.
10136-8{_}5046{_}GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FISH.
10136-8{_}5047{_}In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes, as, if these are broken, the beauty of the fish is lost.
10136-8{_}5048{_}The carver should be acquainted, too, with the choicest parts and morsels; and to give each guest an equal share of these _titbits_ should be his maxim.
10136-8{_}5049{_}Steel knives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart to it a very disagreeable flavour.
10136-8{_}5050{_}Where silver fish-carvers are considered too dear to be bought, good electro-plated ones answer very well, and are inexpensive.
10136-8{_}5051{_}The prices set down for them by Messrs.
10136-8{_}5052{_}Slack, of the Strand, are from a guinea upwards.
10136-8{_}5053{_}COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.

[Illustration]  First run the knife along the centre of the side of the fish, namely, from _d_ to _b_, down to the bone; then carve it in unbroken slices downwards from _d_ to _e_, or upwards from _d_ to _c_, as shown in the engraving.
10136-8{_}5056{_}The carver should ask the guests if they would like a portion of the roe and liver.
10136-8{_}5057{_}_Note_.--Of this fish, the parts about the backbone and shoulders are the firmest, and most esteemed by connoisseurs.
10136-8{_}5058{_}The sound, which lines the fish beneath the backbone, is considered a delicacy, as are also the gelatinous parts about the head and neck.

10136-8{_}5061{_}301; and for mode of dressing, Coloured Plate B.)
10136-8{_}5062{_}[Illustration]  First run the knife quite down to the bone, along the side of the fish, from _a_ to _b_, and also from _c_ to _d_.
10136-8{_}5063{_}Then help the thick part lengthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from _a_ to _b_; and the thin part breadthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from _e_ to _f_, as shown in the engraving.
10136-8{_}5064{_}A slice of the thick part should always be accompanied by a smaller piece of the thin from the belly, where lies the fat of the fish.
10136-8{_}5065{_}_Note_.--Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slicing the thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated; and thus, by the breaking of the flakes, the beauty of its appearance is destroyed.
10136-8{_}5066{_}BOILED OR FRIED SOLE.
10136-8{_}5067{_}(For recipes, see Nos.
10136-8{_}5068{_}321 and 327.)
10136-8{_}5069{_}The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces.
10136-8{_}5070{_}A moderately-sized sole will be sufficient for three slices; namely, the head, middle, and tail.
10136-8{_}5071{_}The guests should be asked which of these they prefer.
10136-8{_}5072{_}A small one will only give two slices.
10136-8{_}5073{_}If the sole is very large, the upper side may be raised from the bone, and then divided into pieces; and the under side afterwards served in the same way.
10136-8{_}5074{_}In helping FILLETED SOLES, one fillet is given to each person.
10136-8{_}5075{_}(For mode of serving, see Coloured Plate A.)
10136-8{_}5076{_}TURBOT.
10136-8{_}5077{_}(For recipe, see No.
10136-8{_}5078{_}337; and for mode of serving, Coloured Plate E.)  First run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite through to the bone, from _a_ to _b_, and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards, from _c_ to _e_, and upwards from _c_ to _d_, as shown in the engraving.
10136-8{_}5079{_}When the carver has removed all the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone should be raised, put on one side of the dish, and the under side helped as the upper.
10136-8{_}5080{_}A BRILL and JOHN DORY are carved in the same manner as a Turbot.
10136-8{_}5081{_}[Illustration]  _Note_.--The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices in a turbot; and the rich gelatinous skin covering the fish, as well as a little of the thick part of the fins, are dainty morsels, and should be placed on each plate.
10136-8{_}5082{_}WHITING, &c.  Whiting, pike, haddock, and other fish, when of a sufficiently large size, may be carved in the same manner as salmon.
10136-8{_}5083{_}When small, they may be cut through, bone and all, and helped in nice pieces, a middling-sized whiting serving for two slices.
10136-8{_}5084{_}_Note_.--The THICK part of the EEL is reckoned the best; and this holds good of all flat fish.
10136-8{_}5085{_}The TAIL of the LOBSTER is the prime part, and next to that the CLAWS.

10136-8{_}5088{_}CHAPTER IX.
10136-8{_}5089{_}GENERAL REMARKS.
10136-8{_}5090{_}354.
10136-8{_}5091{_}AN ANECDOTE IS TOLD of the prince de Soubise, who, intending to give an entertainment, asked for the bill of fare.
10136-8{_}5092{_}His _chef_ came, presenting a list adorned with vignettes, and the first article of which, that met the prince's eye, was "fifty hams."
10136-8{_}5093{_}"Bertrand," said the prince, "I think you must be extravagant; Fifty hams!
10136-8{_}5094{_}do you intend to feast my whole regiment?"
10136-8{_}5095{_}"No, Prince, there will be but one on the table, and the surplus I need for my Espagnole, blondes, garnitures, &c." "Bertrand, you are robbing me: this item will not do."
10136-8{_}5096{_}"Monseigneur," said the _artiste_, "you do not appreciate me.
10136-8{_}5097{_}Give me the order, and I will put those fifty hams in a crystal flask no longer than my thumb."
10136-8{_}5098{_}The prince smiled, and the hams were passed.
10136-8{_}5099{_}This was all very well for the prince de Soubise; but as we do not write for princes and nobles alone, but that our British sisters may make the best dishes out of the least expensive ingredients, we will also pass the hams, and give a few general directions concerning Sauces, &c.  355.
10136-8{_}5100{_}THE PREPARATION AND APPEARANCE OF SAUCES AND GRAVIES are of the highest consequence, and in nothing does the talent and taste of the cook more display itself.
10136-8{_}5101{_}Their special adaptability to the various viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied, in order that they may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly, so to speak, as does a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the singer.
10136-8{_}5102{_}356.
10136-8{_}5103{_}THE GENERAL BASIS OF MOST GRAVIES and some sauces is the same stock as that used for soups (_see_ Nos.
10136-8{_}5104{_}104, 105, 106, and 107); and, by the employment of these, with, perhaps, an additional slice of ham, a little spice, a few herbs, and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or ketchup, very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure.
10136-8{_}5105{_}A milt (either of a bullock or sheep), the shank-end of mutton that has already been dressed, and the necks and feet of poultry, may all be advantageously used for gravy, where much is not required.
10136-8{_}5106{_}It may, then, be established as a rule, that there exists no necessity for good gravies to be expensive, and that there is no occasion, as many would have the world believe, to buy ever so many pounds of fresh meat, in order to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy.
10136-8{_}5107{_}357.
10136-8{_}5108{_}BROWN SAUCES, generally speaking, should scarcely be so thick as white sauces; and it is well to bear in mind, that all those which are intended to mask the various dishes of poultry or meat, should be of a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over which they are poured.
10136-8{_}5109{_}For browning and thickening sauces, &c., browned flour may be properly employed.
10136-8{_}5110{_}358.
10136-8{_}5111{_}SAUCES SHOULD POSSESS A DECIDED CHARACTER; and whether sharp or sweet, savoury or plain, they should carry out their names in a distinct manner, although, of course, not so much flavoured as to make them too piquant on the one hand, or too mawkish on the other.
10136-8{_}5112{_}359.
10136-8{_}5113{_}GRAVIES AND SAUCES SHOULD BE SENT TO TABLE VERY HOT; and there is all the more necessity for the cook to see to this point, as, from their being usually served in small quantities, they are more liable to cool quickly than if they were in a larger body.
10136-8{_}5114{_}Those sauces, of which cream or eggs form a component part, should be well stirred, as soon as these ingredients are added to them, and must never be allowed to boil; as, in that case, they would instantly curdle.
10136-8{_}5115{_}360.
10136-8{_}5116{_}ALTHOUGH PICKLES MAY BE PURCHASED at shops at as low a rate as they can usually be made for at home, or perhaps even for less, yet we would advise all housewives, who have sufficient time and convenience, to prepare their own.
10136-8{_}5117{_}The only general rules, perhaps, worth stating here,--as in the recipes all necessary details will be explained, are, that the vegetables and fruits used should be sound, and not over ripe, and that the very best vinegar should be employed.
10136-8{_}5118{_}361.
10136-8{_}5119{_}FOR FORCEMEATS, SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NECESSARY.
10136-8{_}5120{_}The points which cooks should, in this branch of cookery, more particularly observe, are the thorough chopping of the suet, the complete mincing of the herbs, the careful grating of the bread-crumbs, and the perfect mixing of the whole.
10136-8{_}5121{_}These are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats, and they can scarcely be cut too small, as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere perceptible.
10136-8{_}5122{_}To conclude, the flavour of no one spice or herb should be permitted to predominate.
10136-8{_}5123{_}RECIPES.
10136-8{_}5124{_}CHAPTER X.   SAUCES, PICKLES, GRAVIES, AND FORCEMEATS.
10136-8{_}5125{_}ANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH.
10136-8{_}5126{_}362.
10136-8{_}5127{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 anchovies, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5128{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of melted butter, cayenne to taste.
10136-8{_}5129{_}_Mode_.--Bone the anchovies, and pound them in a mortar to a paste, with 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5130{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}5131{_}Make the melted butter hot, stir in the pounded anchovies and cayenne; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes; and if liked, add a squeeze of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}5132{_}A more general and expeditious way of making this sauce is to stir in 1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to 1/2 pint of melted butter, and to add seasoning to taste.
10136-8{_}5133{_}Boil the whole up for 1 minute, and serve hot.
10136-8{_}5134{_}_Time_.--5 minutes.
10136-8{_}5135{_}_Average cost_, 5d.
10136-8{_}5136{_}for 1/2 pint.
10136-8{_}5137{_}_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a brill, small turbot, 3 or 4 soles, &c.  ANCHOVY BUTTER (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}5138{_}227).
10136-8{_}5139{_}[Illustration: THE CAPISCUM.]
10136-8{_}5140{_}CAYENNE.--This is the most acrid and stimulating spice with     which we are acquainted.
10136-8{_}5141{_}It is a powder prepared from several     varieties of the capsicum annual East-India plants, of which     there are three so far naturalized in this country as to be able     to grow in the open air: these are the Guinea, the Cherry, and     the Bell pepper.
10136-8{_}5142{_}All the pods of these are extremely pungent to     the taste, and in the green state are used by us as a pickle.
10136-8{_}5143{_}When ripe, they are ground into cayenne pepper, and sold as a     condiment.
10136-8{_}5144{_}The best of this, however, is made in the West     Indies, from what is called the _Bird_ pepper, on account of     hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it.
10136-8{_}5145{_}It is imported     ready for use.
10136-8{_}5146{_}Of the capiscum species of plants there are five;     but the principal are,--1.
10136-8{_}5147{_}_Capsicum annuum_, the common     long-podded capsicum, which is cultivated in our gardens, and of     which there are two varieties, one with red, and another with     yellow fruit.
10136-8{_}5148{_}2.
10136-8{_}5149{_}_Capsicum baccatum_, or bird pepper, which     rises with a shrubby stalk four or five feet high, with its     berries growing at the division of the branches: this is small,     oval-shaped, and of a bright-red colour, from which, as we have     said, the best cayenne is made.
10136-8{_}5150{_}3.
10136-8{_}5151{_}_Capsicum grossum_, the     bell-pepper: the fruit of this is red, and is the only kind fit     for pickling.
10136-8{_}5152{_}APPLE SAUCE FOR GEESE, PORK, &c.  363.
10136-8{_}5153{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, sifted sugar to taste, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, water.
10136-8{_}5154{_}_Mode_.--Pare, core, and quarter the apples, and throw them into cold water to preserve their whiteness.
10136-8{_}5155{_}Put them in a saucepan, with sufficient water to moisten them, and boil till soft enough to pulp.
10136-8{_}5156{_}Beat them up, adding sugar to taste, and a small piece of butter This quantity is sufficient for a good-sized tureen.

10136-8{_}5194{_}WHITE PEPPER.--This is the produce of the same plant as that     which produces the black pepper, from which it is manufactured     by steeping this in lime and water, and rubbing it between the     hands till the coats come off.
10136-8{_}5195{_}The best berries only will bear     this operation; hence the superior qualities of white pepper     fetch a higher price than those of the other.
10136-8{_}5196{_}It is less acrid     than the black, and is much prized among the Chinese.
10136-8{_}5197{_}It is     sometimes adulterated with rice-flour, as the black is with     burnt bread.
10136-8{_}5198{_}The berries of the pepper-plant grow in spikes of     from twenty to thirty, and are, when ripe, of a bright-red     colour.
10136-8{_}5199{_}After being gathered, which is done when they are green,     they are spread out in the sun, where they dry and become black     and shrivelled, when they are ready for being prepared for the     market.

10136-8{_}5203{_}_Mode_.--Put the stock into a stewpan, with the parsley, cloves, bay-leaf, herbs, and mushrooms; add a seasoning of salt, but no pepper, as that would give the sauce a dusty appearance, and should be avoided.
10136-8{_}5204{_}When it has boiled long enough to extract the flavour of the herbs, etc., strain it, and boil it up quickly again, until it is nearly half-reduced.
10136-8{_}5205{_}Now mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cream, and let it simmer very gently for 5 minutes over a slow fire; pour to it the reduced stock, and continue to simmer slowly for 10 minutes, if the sauce be thick.
10136-8{_}5206{_}If, on the contrary, it be too thin, it must be stirred over a sharp fire till it thickens.
10136-8{_}5207{_}This is the foundation of many kinds of sauces, especially white sauces.
10136-8{_}5208{_}Always make it thick, as you can easily thin it with cream, milk, or white stock.

10136-8{_}5212{_}[Illustration: THE CLOVE.]
10136-8{_}5213{_}THE CLOVE.--The clove-tree is a native of the Molucca Islands,     particularly Amboyna, and attains the height of a laurel-tree,     and no verdure is ever seen under it.
10136-8{_}5214{_}From the extremities of     the branches quantities of flowers grow, first white; then they     become green, and next red and hard, when they have arrived at     their clove state.
10136-8{_}5215{_}When they become dry, they assume a yellowish     hue, which subsequently changes into a dark brown.
10136-8{_}5216{_}As an     aromatic, the clove is highly stimulating, and yields an     abundance of oil.
10136-8{_}5217{_}There are several varieties of the clove; the     best is called the _royal clove_, which is scarce, and which is     blacker and smaller than the other kinds.
10136-8{_}5218{_}It is a curious fact,     that the flowers, when fully developed, are quite inodorous, and     that the real fruit is not in the least aromatic.
10136-8{_}5219{_}The form is     that of a nail, having a globular head, formed of the four     petals of the corolla, and four leaves of the calyx not     expanded, with a nearly cylindrical germen, scarcely an inch in     length, situate below.

10136-8{_}5224{_}_Mode_.--Put in a stewpan the milk, and 1/2 pint of water, with the onions, mace, mushrooms, parsley, and salt.
10136-8{_}5225{_}Let these simmer gently for 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}5226{_}In the mean time, rub on a plate 1 oz.

10136-8{_}5239{_}_Mode_.--Wash the beets free from dirt, and be very careful not to prick the outside skin, or they would lose their beautiful colour.
10136-8{_}5240{_}Put them into boiling water, let them simmer gently, and when about three parts done, which will be in 1-1/2 hour, take them out and let them cool.
10136-8{_}5241{_}Boil the vinegar with pepper and allspice, in the above proportion, for ten minutes, and when cold, pour it on the beets, which must be peeled and cut into slices about 1/2 inch thick.

10136-8{_}5245{_}[Illustration: BLACK PEPPER.]
10136-8{_}5246{_}BLACK PEPPER.--This well-known aromatic spice is the fruit of a     species of climbing vine, and is a native of the East Indies,     and is extensively cultivated in Malabar and the eastern islands     of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and others in the same latitude.
10136-8{_}5247{_}It was formerly confined to these countries, but it has now been     introduced to Cayenne.
10136-8{_}5248{_}It is generally employed as a condiment;     but it should never be forgotten, that, even in small     quantities, it produces detrimental effects on inflammatory     constitutions.
10136-8{_}5249{_}Dr. Paris, in his work on Diet, says, "Foreign     spices were not intended by Nature for the inhabitants of     temperate climes; they are heating, and highly stimulant.
10136-8{_}5250{_}I am,     however, not anxious to give more weight to this objection than     it deserves.
10136-8{_}5251{_}Man is no longer the child of Nature, nor the     passive inhabitant of any particular region.
10136-8{_}5252{_}He ranges over     every part of the globe, and elicits nourishment from the     productions of every climate.
10136-8{_}5253{_}Nature is very kind in favouring     the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer     our local wants.
10136-8{_}5254{_}Those climates, for instance, which engender     endemic diseases, are, in general, congenial to the growth of     plants that operate as antidotes to them.
10136-8{_}5255{_}But if we go to the     East for tea, there is no reason why we should not go to the     West for sugar.
10136-8{_}5256{_}The dyspeptic invalid, however, should be     cautious in their use; they may afford temporary benefit, at the     expense of permanent mischief.
10136-8{_}5257{_}It has been well said, that the     best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite, and their     worst to destroy, by insensible degrees, the tone of the     stomach.
10136-8{_}5258{_}The intrinsic goodness of meats should always be     suspected when they require spicy seasonings to compensate for     their natural want of sapidity."
10136-8{_}5259{_}The quality of pepper is known     by rubbing it between the hands: that which withstands this     operation is good, that which is reduced to powder by it is bad.
10136-8{_}5260{_}The quantity of pepper imported into Europe is very great.

10136-8{_}5298{_}The browning for soups (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}5299{_}108) answers equally well for sauces and gravies, when it is absolutely necessary to colour them in this manner; but where they can be made to look brown by using ketchup, wine, browned flour, tomatoes, or any colour sauce, it is far preferable.
10136-8{_}5300{_}As, however, in cooking, so much depends on appearance, perhaps it would be as well for the inexperienced cook to use the artificial means (No.

10136-8{_}5436{_}[Illustration: ARROWROOT.]
10136-8{_}5437{_}ARROWROOT.--This nutritious fecula is obtained from the roots of     a plant which is cultivated in both the East and West Indies.
10136-8{_}5438{_}When the roots are about a year old, they are dug up, and, after     being well washed, are beaten to a pulp, which is afterwards, by     means of water, separated from the fibrous part.
10136-8{_}5439{_}After being     passed through a sieve, once more washed, and then suffered to     settle, the sediment is dried in the sun, when it has become     arrowroot.
10136-8{_}5440{_}The best is obtained from the West Indies, but a     large quantity of what is sold in London is adulterated with     potato-starch.
10136-8{_}5441{_}As a means of knowing arrowroot when it is good,     it may be as well to state, that the genuine article, when     formed into a jelly, will remain firm for three or four days,     whilst the adulterated will become as thin as milk in the course     of twelve hours.

10136-8{_}5490{_}When all this is done, and the apples are quite cold, put them into a large pan, and gradually mix the whole of the rest of the ingredients, including the remaining half-bottle of vinegar.
10136-8{_}5491{_}It must be well stirred until the whole is thoroughly blended, and then put into bottles for use.
10136-8{_}5492{_}Tie a piece of wet bladder over the mouths of the bottles, after they are well corked.
10136-8{_}5493{_}This chetney is very superior to any which can be bought, and one trial will prove it to be delicious.
10136-8{_}5494{_}_Note_.--This recipe was given by a native to an English lady, who had long been a resident in India, and who, since her return to her native country, has become quite celebrated amongst her friends for the excellence of this Eastern relish.
10136-8{_}5495{_}[Illustration: GARLIC.]
10136-8{_}5496{_}GARLIC.--The smell of this plant is generally considered     offensive, and it is the most acrimonious in its taste of the     whole of the alliaceous tribe.
10136-8{_}5497{_}In 1548 it was introduced to     England from the shores of the Mediterranean, where it is     abundant, and in Sicily it grows naturally.
10136-8{_}5498{_}It was in greater     repute with our ancestors than it is with ourselves, although it     is still used as a seasoning herb.
10136-8{_}5499{_}On the continent, especially     in Italy, it is much used, and the French consider it an     essential in many made dishes.

10136-8{_}5555{_}It is the growth, however, of the same countries;     indeed, all the spices are the produce of tropical climates     only.
10136-8{_}5556{_}Originally, the most valuable of these were found in the     Spice Islands, or Moluccas, of the Indian Ocean, and were highly     prized by the nations of antiquity.

10136-8{_}5581{_}Cucumbers were observed, too, by Bishop Heber,     beyond the Ganges, in India; and Burckhardt noticed them in     Palestine.

10136-8{_}5584{_}AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PRESERVING CUCUMBERS.
10136-8{_}5585{_}403.
10136-8{_}5586{_}INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water; 1 lb.
10136-8{_}5587{_}of lump sugar, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5588{_}of ginger, cucumbers.
10136-8{_}5589{_}_Mode_.--Choose the greenest cucumbers, and those that are most free from seeds; put them in strong salt and water, with a cabbage-leaf to keep them down; tie a paper over them, and put them in a warm place till they are yellow; then wash them and set them over the fire in fresh water, with a very little salt, and another cabbage-leaf over them; cover very closely, but take care they do not boil.
10136-8{_}5590{_}If they are not a fine green, change the water again, cover them as before, and make them hot.
10136-8{_}5591{_}When they are a good colour, take them off the fire and let them cool; cut them in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp, and put them into cold water.
10136-8{_}5592{_}Let them remain for 2 days, changing the water twice each day, to draw out the salt.
10136-8{_}5593{_}Put the sugar, with 1/4 pint of water, in a saucepan over the fire; remove the scum as it rises, and add the lemon-peel and ginger with the outside scraped off; when the syrup is tolerably thick, take it off the fire, and when _cold_, wipe the cucumbers _dry_, and put them in.
10136-8{_}5594{_}Boil the syrup once in 2 or 3 days for 3 weeks; strengthen it if required, and let it be quite cold before the cucumbers are put in.
10136-8{_}5595{_}Great attention must be paid to the directions in the commencement of this recipe, as, if these are not properly carried out, the result will be far from satisfactory.
10136-8{_}5596{_}_Seasonable_.--This recipe should be used in June, July, or August.
10136-8{_}5597{_}[Illustration: SALT-MINE AT NORTHWICH.]
10136-8{_}5598{_}COMMON SALT.--By this we mean salt used for cooking purposes,     which is found in great abundance both on land and in the waters     of the ocean.
10136-8{_}5599{_}Sea or salt water, as it is often called,     contains, it has been discovered, about three per cent, of salt     on an average.
10136-8{_}5600{_}Solid rocks of salt are also found in various     parts of the world, and the county of Chester contains many of     these mines, and it is from there that much of our salt comes.
10136-8{_}5601{_}Some springs are so highly impregnated with salt, as to have     received the name of "brine" springs, and are supposed to have     become so by passing through the salt rocks below ground, and     thus dissolving a portion of this mineral substance.
10136-8{_}5602{_}We here     give an engraving of a salt-mine at Northwich, Cheshire, where     both salt-mines and brine-springs are exceedingly productive,     and are believed to have been wrought so far back as during the     occupation of Britain by the Romans.
10136-8{_}5603{_}CUSTARD SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS OR TARTS.

10136-8{_}5605{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 2 eggs, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}5606{_}of pounded sugar, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.
10136-8{_}5607{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk in a very clean saucepan, and let it boil.
10136-8{_}5608{_}Beat the eggs, stir to them the milk and pounded sugar, and put the mixture into a jug.
10136-8{_}5609{_}Place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water; keep stirring well until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}5610{_}Serve the sauce in a tureen, stir in the brandy, and grate a little nutmeg over the top.
10136-8{_}5611{_}This sauce may be made very much nicer by using cream instead of milk; but the above recipe will be found quite good enough for ordinary purposes.
10136-8{_}5612{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}5613{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}5614{_}_Sufficient_, this quantity, for 2 fruit tarts, or 1 pudding.
10136-8{_}5615{_}DUTCH SAUCE FOR FISH.
10136-8{_}5616{_}405.
10136-8{_}5617{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}5618{_}of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, the yolks of 2 eggs, the juice of 1/2 lemon; salt to taste.
10136-8{_}5619{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients, except the lemon-juice, into a stew-pan; set it over the fire, and keep continually stirring.
10136-8{_}5620{_}When it is sufficiently thick, take it off, as it should not boil.
10136-8{_}5621{_}If, however, it happens to curdle, strain the sauce through a tammy, add the lemon-juice, and serve.
10136-8{_}5622{_}Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain, and, by many, is considered far preferable.
10136-8{_}5623{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}5624{_}Note.--This sauce may be poured hot over salad, and left to get quite cold, when it should be thick, smooth, and somewhat stiff.
10136-8{_}5625{_}Excellent salads may be made of hard eggs, or the remains of salt fish flaked nicely from the bone, by pouring over a little of the above mixture when hot, and allowing it to cool.
10136-8{_}5626{_}[Illustration: THE LEMON.]
10136-8{_}5627{_}THE LEMON.--This fruit is a native of Asia, and is mentioned by     Virgil as an antidote to poison.
10136-8{_}5628{_}It is hardier than the orange,     and, as one of the citron tribe, was brought into Europe by the     Arabians.
10136-8{_}5629{_}The lemon was first cultivated in England in the     beginning of the 17th century, and is now often to be found in     our green-houses.
10136-8{_}5630{_}The kind commonly sold, however, is imported     from Portugal, Spain, and the Azores.
10136-8{_}5631{_}Some also come from St.     Helena; but those from Spain are esteemed the best.
10136-8{_}5632{_}Its juice is     now an essential for culinary purposes; but as an antiscorbutic     its value is still greater.
10136-8{_}5633{_}This juice, which is called _citric     acid_, may be preserved in bottles for a considerable time, by     covering it with a thin stratum of oil.
10136-8{_}5634{_}_Shrub_ is made from it     with rum and sugar.
10136-8{_}5635{_}GREEN DUTCH SAUCE, or HOLLANDAISE VERTE.
10136-8{_}5636{_}406.

10136-8{_}5638{_}367, seasoning to taste of salt and cayenne, a little parsley-green to colour, the juice of 1/2 a lemon.
10136-8{_}5639{_}_Mode_.--Put the Béchamel into a saucepan with the seasoning, and bring it to a boil.
10136-8{_}5640{_}Make a green colouring by pounding some parsley in a mortar, and squeezing all the juice from it.
10136-8{_}5641{_}Let this just simmer, when add it to the sauce.
10136-8{_}5642{_}A moment before serving, put in the lemon-juice, but not before; for otherwise the sauce would turn yellow, and its appearance be thus spoiled.
10136-8{_}5643{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}5644{_}BÉCHAMEL SAUCE--This sauce takes its name from a Monsieur     Béchamel, a rich French financier, who, according to Borne     authorities, invented it; whilst others affirm he only     patronized it.
10136-8{_}5645{_}Be this as it may, it is one of the most pleasant     sauces which come to table, and should be most carefully and     intelligently prepared.
10136-8{_}5646{_}It is frequently used, as in the above     recipe, as a principal ingredient and basis for other sauces.

10136-8{_}5654{_}Put the vinegar, with the pepper and ginger, into a stewpan, and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}5655{_}Now place the eggs in a jar, pour over them the vinegar, &c., boiling hot, and, when cold, tie them down with bladder to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}5656{_}This pickle will be ready for use in a month.
10136-8{_}5657{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.
10136-8{_}5658{_}9d.
10136-8{_}5659{_}_Seasonable_.--This should be made about Easter, as at this time eggs are plentiful and cheap.
10136-8{_}5660{_}A store of pickled eggs will be found very useful and ornamental in serving with many first and second course dishes.
10136-8{_}5661{_}[Illustration: GINGER.]
10136-8{_}5662{_}The ginger-plant, known to naturalists as _Zingiber officinale_,     is a native, of the East and West Indies.
10136-8{_}5663{_}It grows somewhat like     the lily of the valley, but its height is about three feet.
10136-8{_}5664{_}In     Jamaica it flowers about August or September, fading about the     end of the year.
10136-8{_}5665{_}The fleshy creeping roots, which form the     ginger of commerce, are in a proper state to be dug when the     stalks are entirely withered.
10136-8{_}5666{_}This operation is usually     performed in January and February; and when the roots are taken     out of the earth, each one is picked, scraped, separately     washed, and afterwards very carefully dried.
10136-8{_}5667{_}Ginger is generally     considered as less pungent and heating to the system than might     he expected from its effects on the organs of taste, and it is     frequently used, with considerable effect, as an anti-spasmodic     and carminative.

10136-8{_}5704{_}It is a bulbous root, and when     full grown, its leaves wither in July.
10136-8{_}5705{_}They ought to be taken up     in the autumn, and when dried in the house, will keep till     spring.

10136-8{_}5794{_}[Illustration: BASIL.]
10136-8{_}5795{_}SWEET HERBS.--Those most usually employed for purposes of     cooking, such as the flavouring of soups, sauces, forcemeats,     &c., are thyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil.
10136-8{_}5796{_}Other     sweet herbs are cultivated for purposes of medicine and     perfumery: they are most grateful both to the organs of taste     and smelling; and to the aroma derived from them is due, in a     great measure, the sweet and exhilarating fragrance of our     "flowery meads."
10136-8{_}5797{_}In town, sweet herbs have to be procured at the     greengrocers' or herbalists', whilst, in the country, the garden     should furnish all that are wanted, the cook taking great care     to have some dried in the autumn for her use throughout the     winter months.
10136-8{_}5798{_}FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED PIKE.
10136-8{_}5799{_}418.
10136-8{_}5800{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 oz.
10136-8{_}5801{_}of bread crumbs, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, 8 oysters, 2 anchovies (these may be dispensed with), 2 oz.
10136-8{_}5802{_}of suet; salt, pepper, and pounded mace to taste; 6 tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, the yolks of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}5803{_}_Mode_.--Beard and mince the oysters, prepare and mix the other ingredients by recipe No.
10136-8{_}5804{_}416, and blend the whole thoroughly together.
10136-8{_}5805{_}Moisten with the cream and eggs, put all into a stewpan, and stir it over the fire till it thickens, when put it into the fish, which should have previously been cut open, and sew it up.

10136-8{_}5808{_}_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized pike.
10136-8{_}5809{_}FRENCH FORCEMEAT.
10136-8{_}5810{_}419.
10136-8{_}5811{_}It will be well to state, in the beginning of this recipe, that French forcemeat, or quenelles, consist of the blending of three separate processes; namely, panada, udder, and whatever meat you intend using.
10136-8{_}5812{_}PANADA.
10136-8{_}5813{_}420.
10136-8{_}5814{_}INGREDIENTS.--The crumb of 2 penny rolls, 4 tablespoonfuls of white stock, No.
10136-8{_}5815{_}107, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5816{_}of butter, 1 slice of ham, 1 bay-leaf, a little minced parsley, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, a few mushrooms (when obtainable), butter, the yolks of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}5817{_}_Mode_.--Soak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about 1/2 hour, then take it out, and squeeze so as to press the milk from it; put the soaked bread into a stewpan with the above quantity of white stock, and set it on one side; then put into a separate stewpan 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5818{_}of butter, a slice of lean ham cut small, with a bay-leaf, herbs, mushrooms, spices, &c., in the above proportions, and fry them gently over a slow fire.
10136-8{_}5819{_}When done, moisten with 2 teacupfuls of white stock, boil for 20 minutes, and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan.
10136-8{_}5820{_}Place it over the fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent its burning, and when quite dry, put in a small piece of butter.
10136-8{_}5821{_}Let this again dry up by stirring over the fire; then add the yolks of 2 eggs, mix well, put the panada to cool on a clean plate, and use it when required.
10136-8{_}5822{_}Panada should always be well flavoured, as the forcemeat receives no taste from any of the other ingredients used in its preparation.
10136-8{_}5823{_}Boiled Calf's Udder for French Forcemeats.
10136-8{_}5824{_}421.
10136-8{_}5825{_}Put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it; let it stew gently till quite done, when take it out to cool.
10136-8{_}5826{_}Trim all the upper parts, cut it into small pieces, and pound well in a mortar, till it can be rubbed through a sieve.
10136-8{_}5827{_}That portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are generally composed; but many cooks substitute butter for this, being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation.
10136-8{_}5828{_}[Illustration: PESTLE AND MORTAR.]
10136-8{_}5829{_}PESTLE AND MORTAR.--No cookery can be perfectly performed     without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the     engraving.
10136-8{_}5830{_}For pounding things sufficiently fine, they are     invaluable, and the use of them will save a good deal of time,     besides increasing the excellence of the preparations.
10136-8{_}5831{_}They are     made of iron, and, in that material, can be bought cheap; but as     these are not available, for all purposes, we should recommend,     as more economical in the end, those made of Wedgwood, although     these are considerably more expensive than the former.
10136-8{_}5832{_}Veal Quenelles.
10136-8{_}5833{_}422.
10136-8{_}5834{_}INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of veal, panada (No.
10136-8{_}5835{_}420), and calf's udder (No.
10136-8{_}5836{_}421), 2 eggs; seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded mace, or grated nutmeg; a little flour.
10136-8{_}5837{_}_Mode_.--Take the fleshy part of veal, scrape it with a knife, till all the meat is separated from the sinews, and allow about 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}5838{_}for an entrée.
10136-8{_}5839{_}Chop the meat, and pound it in a mortar till reduced to a paste; then roll it into a ball; make another of panada (No.
10136-8{_}5840{_}420), the same size, and another of udder (No.
10136-8{_}5841{_}421), taking care that these three balls be of the same _size_.
10136-8{_}5842{_}It is to be remembered, that equality of _size_, and not of weight, is here necessary.
10136-8{_}5843{_}When the three ingredients are properly prepared, pound them altogether in a mortar for some time; for the more quenelles are pounded, the more delicate they are.
10136-8{_}5844{_}Now moisten with the eggs, whites and yolks, and continue pounding, adding a seasoning of pepper, spices, &c. When the whole is well blended together, mould it into balls, or whatever shape is intended, roll them in flour, and poach in boiling water, to which a little salt should have been added.
10136-8{_}5845{_}If the quenelles are not firm enough, add the yolk of another egg, but omit the white, which only makes them hollow and puffy inside.
10136-8{_}5846{_}In the preparation of this recipe, it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned, and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for.
10136-8{_}5847{_}For brown or white ragoûts they should be firm, and when the quenelles are used very small, extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation.
10136-8{_}5848{_}Their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit, fowl, hare, pheasant, grouse, or an extra quantity of mushroom, parsley, &c.  _Time_,--About 1/4 hour to poach in boiling water.
10136-8{_}5849{_}_Sufficient_, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}5850{_}of veal or other meat, with other ingredients in proportion, for 1 entrée.
10136-8{_}5851{_}_Note_.--The French are noted for their skill in making forcemeats; one of the principal causes of their superiority in this respect being, that they pound all the ingredients so diligently and thoroughly.
10136-8{_}5852{_}Any one with the slightest pretensions to refined cookery, must, in this particular, implicitly follow the example of our friends across the Channel.

10136-8{_}5855{_}189.)
10136-8{_}5856{_}423.
10136-8{_}5857{_}SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCEMEATS.--Take a pound and a half of lean veal from the fillet, and cut it in long thin slices; scrape with a knife till nothing but the fibre remains; put it in a mortar, pound it 10 minutes, or until in a purée; pass it through a wire sieve (use the remainder in stock); then take 1 pound of good fresh beef suet, which skin, shred, and chop very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it; then add 6 oz.
10136-8{_}5858{_}of panada (that is, bread soaked in milk and boiled till nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well together, and add the veal; season with a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter one of pepper, half that of nutmeg; work all well together; then add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of the mortar.
10136-8{_}5859{_}When well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water; and if it is delicate, firm, and of a good flavour, it is ready for use.
10136-8{_}5860{_}FRIED BREAD CRUMBS.
10136-8{_}5861{_}424.
10136-8{_}5862{_}Cut the bread into thin slices, place them in a cool oven overnight, and when thoroughly dry and crisp, roll them down into fine crumbs.
10136-8{_}5863{_}Put some lard, or clarified dripping, into a frying-pan; bring it to the boiling-point, throw in the crumbs, and fry them very quickly.
10136-8{_}5864{_}Directly they are done, lift them out with a slice, and drain them before the fire from all greasy moisture.
10136-8{_}5865{_}When quite crisp, they are ready for use.
10136-8{_}5866{_}The fat they are fried in should be clear, and the crumbs should not have the slightest appearance or taste of having been, in the least degree, burnt.
10136-8{_}5867{_}FRIED SIPPETS OF BREAD (for Garnishing many Dishes).
10136-8{_}5868{_}425.
10136-8{_}5869{_}Cut the bread into thin slices, and stamp them out in whatever shape you like,--rings, crosses, diamonds, &c. &c. Fry them in the same manner as the bread crumbs, in clear boiling lard, or clarified dripping, and drain them until thoroughly crisp before the fire.
10136-8{_}5870{_}When variety is desired, fry some of a pale colour, and others of a darker hue.
10136-8{_}5871{_}FRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS.
10136-8{_}5872{_}426.
10136-8{_}5873{_}Proceed as above, by frying some slices of bread cut in any fanciful shape.
10136-8{_}5874{_}When quite crisp, dip one side of the sippet into the beaten white of an egg mixed with a little flour, and place it on the edge of the dish.
10136-8{_}5875{_}Continue in this manner till the border is completed, arranging the sippets a pale and a dark one alternately.
10136-8{_}5876{_}GENEVESE SAUCE FOR SALMON, TROUT, &c.  427.
10136-8{_}5877{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 small carrot, a small faggot of sweet herbs, including parsley, 1 onion, 5 or 6 mushrooms (when obtainable), 1 bay-leaf, 6 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}5878{_}of butter, 1 glass of sherry, 1-1/2 pint of white stock, No.
10136-8{_}5879{_}107, thickening of butter and flour, the juice of half a lemon.
10136-8{_}5880{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the onion and carrot into small rings, and put them into a stewpan with the herbs, mushrooms, bay-leaf, cloves, and mace; add the butter, and simmer the whole very gently over a slow fire until the onion is quite tender.
10136-8{_}5881{_}Pour in the stock and sherry, and stew slowly for 1 hour, when strain it off into a clean saucepan.
10136-8{_}5882{_}Now make a thickening of butter and flour, put it to the sauce, stir it over the fire until perfectly smooth and mellow, add the lemon-juice, give one boil, when it will be ready for table.
10136-8{_}5883{_}_Time_.--Altogether 2 hours.
10136-8{_}5884{_}_Average cost_, 1s.

10136-8{_}5888{_}SAGE.--This was originally a native of the south of Europe, but     it has long been cultivated in the English garden.
10136-8{_}5889{_}There are     several kinds of it, known as the green, the red, the     small-leaved, and the broad-leaved balsamic.
10136-8{_}5890{_}In cookery, its     principal use is for stuffings and sauces, for which purpose the     red is the most agreeable, and the green the next.
10136-8{_}5891{_}The others     are used for medical purposes.
10136-8{_}5892{_}PICKLED GHERKINS.
10136-8{_}5893{_}428.
10136-8{_}5894{_}INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5895{_}of bruised ginger, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}5896{_}of whole black pepper, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}5897{_}of whole allspice, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, a little horseradish.
10136-8{_}5898{_}This proportion of pepper, spices, &c., for 1 quart of vinegar.
10136-8{_}5899{_}_Mode_.--Let the gherkins remain in salt and water for 3 or 4 days, when take them out, wipe perfectly dry, and put them into a stone jar.
10136-8{_}5900{_}Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, with spices and pepper, &c., in the above proportion, for 10 minutes; pour it, quite boiling, over the gherkins, cover the jar with vine-leaves, and put over them a plate, setting them near the fire, where they must remain all night.
10136-8{_}5901{_}Next day drain off the vinegar, boil it up again, and pour it hot over them.
10136-8{_}5902{_}Cover up with fresh leaves, and let the whole remain till quite cold.
10136-8{_}5903{_}Now tie down closely with bladder to exclude the air, and in a month or two, they will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}5904{_}_Time_.--4 days.
10136-8{_}5905{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.
10136-8{_}5906{_}[Illustration: GHERKINS.]
10136-8{_}5907{_}GHERKINS.--Gherkins are young cucumbers; and the only way in     which they are used for cooking purposes is pickling them, as by     the recipe here given.
10136-8{_}5908{_}Not having arrived at maturity, they have     not, of course, so strongly a developed flavour as cucumbers,     and, as a pickle, they are very general favourites.
10136-8{_}5909{_}GOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR BOILED MACKEREL.
10136-8{_}5910{_}429.
10136-8{_}5911{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of green gooseberries, 3 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}5912{_}367 (veal gravy may be substituted for this), 2 oz.
10136-8{_}5913{_}of fresh butter; seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}5914{_}_Mode_.--Boil the gooseberries in water until quite tender; strain them, and rub them through a sieve.
10136-8{_}5915{_}Put into a saucepan the Béchamel or gravy, with the butter and seasoning; add the pulp from the gooseberries, mix all well together, and heat gradually through.
10136-8{_}5916{_}A little pounded sugar added to this sauce is by many persons considered an improvement, as the saccharine matter takes off the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit.
10136-8{_}5917{_}_Time_.--Boil the gooseberries from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}5918{_}_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a large dish of mackerel.
10136-8{_}5919{_}_Seasonable_ from May to July.
10136-8{_}5920{_}[Illustration: THE GOOSEBERRY.]
10136-8{_}5921{_}THE GOOSEBERRY.--This useful and wholesome fruit (_Ribes     grossularia_) is thought to be indigenous to the British Isles,     and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the     eastern counties, although, when uncultivated, it is but a very     small and inferior berry.
10136-8{_}5922{_}The high state of perfection to which     it has been here brought, is due to the skill of the English     gardeners; for in no other country does it attain the same size     and flavour.
10136-8{_}5923{_}The humidity of the British climate, however, has     doubtless something to do with the result; and it is said that     gooseberries produced in Scotland as far north as Inverness, are     of a very superior character.
10136-8{_}5924{_}Malic and citric acid blended with     sugar, produce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry; and upon     the proper development of these properties depends the success     of all cooking operations with which they are connected.
10136-8{_}5925{_}GLAZE FOR COVERING COLD HAMS, TONGUES, &c.  430.
10136-8{_}5926{_}INGREDIENTS.--Stock No.
10136-8{_}5927{_}104 or 107, doubling the quantity of meat in each.
10136-8{_}5928{_}_Mode_.--We may remark at the outset, that unless glaze is wanted in very large quantities, it is seldom made expressly.
10136-8{_}5929{_}Either of the stocks mentioned above, boiled down and reduced very considerably, will be found to produce a very good glaze.
10136-8{_}5930{_}Put the stock into a stewpan, over a nice clear fire; let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff, when keep stirring, to prevent its burning.
10136-8{_}5931{_}The moment it is sufficiently reduced, and comes to a glaze, turn it out into the glaze-pot, of which we have here given an engraving.
10136-8{_}5932{_}As, however, this is not to be found in every establishment, a white earthenware jar would answer the purpose; and this may be placed in a vessel of boiling water, to melt the glaze when required.
10136-8{_}5933{_}It should never be warmed in a saucepan, except on the principle of the bain marie, lest it should reduce too much, and become black and bitter.
10136-8{_}5934{_}If the glaze is wanted of a pale colour, more veal than beef should be used in making the stock; and it is as well to omit turnips and celery, as these impart a disagreeable bitter flavour.
10136-8{_}5935{_}TO GLAZE COLD JOINTS, &c.--Melt the glaze by placing the vessel which contains it, into the bain marie or saucepan of boiling water; brush it over the meat with a paste-brush, and if in places it is not quite covered, repeat the operation.
10136-8{_}5936{_}The glaze should not be too dark a colour.
10136-8{_}5937{_}(_See_ Coloured Cut of Glazed Ham, P.)  [Illustration: GLAZE-KETTLE.]
10136-8{_}5938{_}[Illustration: THE BAIN MARIE.]
10136-8{_}5939{_}GLAZE-KETTLE.--This is a kettle used for keeping the strong     stock boiled down to a jelly, which is known by the name of     glaze.
10136-8{_}5940{_}It is composed of two tin vessels, as shown in the cut,     one of which, the upper,--containing the glaze, is inserted into     one of larger diameter and containing boiling water.
10136-8{_}5941{_}A brush is     put in the small hole at the top of the lid, and is employed for     putting the glaze on anything that may require it.
10136-8{_}5942{_}THE BAIN MARIE.--So long ago as the time when emperors ruled in     Rome, and the yellow Tiber passed through a populous and wealthy     city, this utensil was extensively employed; and it is     frequently mentioned by that profound culinary chemist of the     ancients, Apicius.
10136-8{_}5943{_}It is an open kind of vessel (as shown in the     engraving and explained in our paragraph No.
10136-8{_}5944{_}87, on the French     terms used in modern cookery), filled with boiling or nearly     boiling water; and into this water should be put all the     stewpans containing those ingredients which it is desired to     keep hot.
10136-8{_}5945{_}The quantity and quality of the contents of these     vessels are not at all affected; and if the hour of dinner is     uncertain in any establishment, by reason of the nature of the     master's business, nothing is so certain a means of preserving     the flavour of all dishes as the employment of the bain marie.
10136-8{_}5946{_}GREEN SAUCE FOR GREEN GEESE OR DUCKLINGS.
10136-8{_}5947{_}431.
10136-8{_}5948{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of sorrel-juice, 1 glass of sherry, 1/2 pint of green gooseberries, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}5949{_}of fresh butter.
10136-8{_}5950{_}_Mode_.--Boil the gooseberries in water until they are quite tender; mash them and press them through a sieve; put the pulp into a saucepan with the above ingredients; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}5951{_}_Time_.--3 or 4 minutes.
10136-8{_}5952{_}_Note_.--We have given this recipe as a sauce for green geese, thinking that some of our readers might sometimes require it; but, at the generality of fashionable tables, it is now seldom or never served.
10136-8{_}5953{_}[Illustration: SORREL.]
10136-8{_}5954{_}SORREL.--We gather from the pages of Pliny and Apicius, that     sorrel was cultivated by the Romans in order to give it more     strength and flavour, and that they also partook of it sometimes     stewed with mustard, being seasoned with a little oil and     vinegar.
10136-8{_}5955{_}At the present day, English cookery is not much     indebted to this plant (_Rumex Acetosa_), although the French     make use of it to a considerable extent.
10136-8{_}5956{_}It is found in most     parts of Great Britain, and also on the continent, growing wild     in the grass meadows, and, in a few gardens, it is cultivated.
10136-8{_}5957{_}The acid of sorrel is very _prononcé_, and is what chemists term     a binoxalate of potash; that is, a combination of oxalic acid     with potash.
10136-8{_}5958{_}GENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES.
10136-8{_}5959{_}432.
10136-8{_}5960{_}Either of the stocks, Nos.
10136-8{_}5961{_}104, 105, or 107, will be found to answer very well for the basis of many gravies, unless these are wanted very rich indeed.
10136-8{_}5962{_}By the addition of various store sauces, thickening and flavouring, the stocks here referred to may be converted into very good gravies.
10136-8{_}5963{_}It should be borne in mind, however, that the goodness and strength of spices, wines, flavourings, &c., evaporate, and that they lose a great deal of their fragrance, if added to the gravy a long time before they are wanted.
10136-8{_}5964{_}If this point is attended to, a saving of one half the quantity of these ingredients will be effected, as, with long boiling, the flavour almost entirely passes away.
10136-8{_}5965{_}The shank-bones of mutton, previously well soaked, will be found a great assistance in enriching gravies; a kidney or melt, beef skirt, trimmings of meat, &c. &c., answer very well when only a small quantity is wanted, and, as we have before observed, a good gravy need not necessarily be so very expensive; for economically-prepared dishes are oftentimes found as savoury and wholesome as dearer ones.
10136-8{_}5966{_}The cook should also remember that the fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice, or any strong essences, and that they should always be warmed in a _bain marie_, after they are flavoured, or else in a jar or jug placed in a saucepan full of boiling water.
10136-8{_}5967{_}The remains of roast-meat gravy should always be saved; as, when no meat is at hand, a very nice gravy in haste may be made from it, and when added to hashes, ragoûts, &c., is a great improvement.

10136-8{_}5975{_}INGREDIENTS.--Gravy, salt.
10136-8{_}5976{_}_Mode_.--Put a common dish with a small quantity of salt in it under the meat, about a quarter of an hour before it is removed from the fire.
10136-8{_}5977{_}When the dish is full, take it away, baste the meat, and pour the gravy into the dish on which the joint is to be served.
10136-8{_}5978{_}SAUCES AND GRAVIES IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--Neither poultry,     butcher's meat, nor roast game were eaten dry in the middle     ages, any more than fried fish is now.
10136-8{_}5979{_}Different sauces, each     having its own peculiar flavour, were served with all these     dishes, and even with the various _parts_ of each animal.
10136-8{_}5980{_}Strange and grotesque sauces, as, for example, "eggs cooked on     the spit," "butter fried and roasted," were invented by the     cooks of those days; but these preparations had hardly any other     merit than that of being surprising and difficult to make.

10136-8{_}5990{_}A HUNDRED DIFFERENT DISHES.--Modern housewives know pretty well     how much care, and attention, and foresight are necessary in     order to serve well a little dinner for six or eight persons,--a     dinner which will give credit to the _ménage_, and satisfaction     and pleasure to the guests.
10136-8{_}5991{_}A quickly-made gravy, under some     circumstances that we have known occur, will be useful to many     housekeepers when they have not much time for preparation.
10136-8{_}5992{_}But,     talking of speed, and time, and preparation, what a combination     of all these must have been necessary for the feast at the     wedding of Charles VI.

10136-8{_}5994{_}On that occasion, as Froissart     the chronicler tells us, the art of cooking, with its     innumerable paraphernalia of sauces, with gravy, pepper,     cinnamon, garlic, scallion, brains, gravy soups, milk _potage_,     and ragoûts, had a signal triumph.
10136-8{_}5995{_}The skilful _chef-de-cuisine_     of the royal household covered the great marble table of the     regal palace with no less than a hundred different dishes,     prepared in a hundred different ways.

10136-8{_}6023{_}CLOVES.--This very agreeable spice is the unexpanded flower-buds     of the _Caryophyllus aromaticus_, a handsome, branching tree, a     native of the Malacca Islands.
10136-8{_}6024{_}They take their name from the     Latin word _clavus_, or the French _clou_, both meaning a nail,     and to which the clove has a considerable resemblance.
10136-8{_}6025{_}Cloves     were but little known to the ancients, and Pliny appears to be     the only writer who mentions them; and he says, vaguely enough,     that some were brought to Rome, very similar to grains of     pepper, but somewhat longer; that they were only to be found in     India, in a wood consecrated to the gods; and that they served     in the manufacture of perfumes.
10136-8{_}6026{_}The Dutch, as in the case of the     nutmeg (_see_ 378), endeavoured, when they gained possession of     the Spice Islands, to secure a monopoly of cloves, and, so that     the cultivation of the tree might be confined to Amboyna, their     chief island, bribed the surrounding chiefs to cut down all     trees found elsewhere.
10136-8{_}6027{_}The Amboyna, or royal clove, is said to     be the best, and is rare; but other kinds, nearly equally good,     are produced in other parts of the world, and they come to     Europe from Mauritius, Bourbon, Cayenne, and Martinique, as also     from St. Kitts, St. Vincent's, and Trinidad.
10136-8{_}6028{_}The clove contains     about 20 per cent.
10136-8{_}6029{_}of volatile aromatic oil, to which it owes     its peculiar pungent flavour, its other parts being composed of     woody fibre, water, gum, and resin.

10136-8{_}6051{_}[Illustration: PIMENTO.]
10136-8{_}6052{_}ALLSPICE.--This is the popular name given to pimento, or Jamaica     pepper, known to naturalists as _Eugenia pimenta_, and belonging     to the order of Myrtaceae.
10136-8{_}6053{_}It is the berry of a fine tree in the     West Indies and South America, which attains a height of from     fifteen to twenty feet: the berries are not allowed to ripen,     but, being gathered green, are then dried in the sun, and then     become black.
10136-8{_}6054{_}It is an inexpensive spice, and is considered more     mild and innocent than most other spices; consequently, it is     much used for domestic purposes, combining a very agreeable     variety of flavours.
10136-8{_}6055{_}GRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT FOR FOWLS.
10136-8{_}6056{_}439.
10136-8{_}6057{_}INGREDIENTS.--The necks, feet, livers, and gizzards of the fowls, 1 slice of toasted bread, 1/2 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 1/2 pint of water, thickening of butter and flour, 1 dessertspoonful of ketchup.
10136-8{_}6058{_}_Mode_.--Wash the feet of the fowls thoroughly clean, and cut them and the neck into small pieces.
10136-8{_}6059{_}Put these into a stewpan with the bread, onion, herbs, seasoning, livers, and gizzards; pour the water over them and simmer gently for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}6060{_}Now take out the liver, pound it, and strain the liquor to it.
10136-8{_}6061{_}Add a thickening of butter and flour, and a flavouring of mushroom ketchup; boil it up and serve.

10136-8{_}6066{_}INGREDIENTS.--Bones and trimmings of the cooked joint intended for hashing, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, 1/4 teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of whole allspice, a small faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 head of celery, 1 onion, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6067{_}of butter, thickening, sufficient boiling water to cover the bones.
10136-8{_}6068{_}_Mode_.--Chop the bones in small pieces, and put them in a stewpan, with the trimmings, salt, pepper, spice, herbs, and celery.
10136-8{_}6069{_}Cover with boiling water, and let the whole simmer gently for 1-1/2 or 2 hours.
10136-8{_}6070{_}Slice and fry the onion in the butter till it is of a pale brown, and mix it gradually with the gravy made from the bones; boil for  1/4 hour, and strain into a basin; now put it back into the stewpan; flavour with walnut pickle or ketchup, pickled-onion liquor, or any store sauce that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}6071{_}Thicken with a little butter and flour, kneaded together on a plate, and the gravy will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6072{_}After the thickening is added, the gravy should just boil, to take off the rawness of the flour.

10136-8{_}6079{_}of lean ham, 1 onion or a few shalots, 2 pints of water, salt and whole pepper to taste, 1 blade of mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 a large carrot, 1/2 a head of celery.
10136-8{_}6080{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the beef and ham into small pieces, and slice the vegetables; take a jar, capable of holding two pints of water, and arrange therein, in layers, the ham, meat, vegetables, and seasoning, alternately, filling up with the above quantity of water; tie down the jar, or put a plate over the top, so that the steam may not escape; place it in the oven, and let it remain there from 6 to 8 hours; should, however, the oven be very hot, less time will be required.
10136-8{_}6081{_}When sufficiently cooked, strain the gravy, and when cold, remove the fat.
10136-8{_}6082{_}It may be flavoured with ketchup, wines, or any other store sauce that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}6083{_}It is a good plan to put the jar in a cool oven over-night, to draw the gravy; and then it will not require so long baking the following day.

10136-8{_}6087{_}[Illustration: CELERY.]
10136-8{_}6088{_}CELERY.--As in the above recipe, the roots of celery are     principally used in England for flavouring soups, sauces, and     gravies, and for serving with cheese at the termination of a     dinner, and as an ingredient for salad.
10136-8{_}6089{_}In Italy, however, the     green leaves and stems are also employed for stews and soups,     and the seeds are also more frequently made use of on the     continent than in our own islands.
10136-8{_}6090{_}In Germany, celery is very     highly esteemed; and it is there boiled and served up as a dish     by itself, as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes.
10136-8{_}6091{_}We ourselves think that this mild aromatic plant might oftener     be cooked than it is; for there are very few nicer vegetable     preparations brought to table than a well-dressed plate of     stewed celery.
10136-8{_}6092{_}VEAL GRAVY FOR WHITE SAUCES, FRICASSEES, &c.  442.

10136-8{_}6095{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the ham and veal into small square pieces, put these in a stewpan, moistening them with a small quantity of water; place them over the fire to draw down.
10136-8{_}6096{_}When the bottom of the stewpan becomes covered with a white glaze, fill up with water in the above proportion; add the remaining ingredients, stew very slowly for 3 or 4 hours, and do not forget to skim well the moment it boils.
10136-8{_}6097{_}Put it by, and, when cold, take off all the fat.
10136-8{_}6098{_}This may be used for Béchamel, sauce tournée, and many other white sauces.

10136-8{_}6105{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, except the thickening and lemon-juice, and let them simmer very gently for rather more than 1 hour, or until the liquor is reduced to a pint, when strain through a hair-sieve.
10136-8{_}6106{_}Add a thickening of butter and flour, and the lemon-juice; set it on the fire, and let it just boil up, when it will be ready for use.

10136-8{_}6112{_}INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of venison, 3 or 4 mutton shank-bones, salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 2 teaspoonfuls of walnut ketchup.
10136-8{_}6113{_}_Mode_.--Brown the trimmings over a nice clear fire, and put them in a stewpan with the shank-bones and water; simmer gently for 2 hours, strain and skim, and add the walnut ketchup and a seasoning of salt.
10136-8{_}6114{_}Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve.
10136-8{_}6115{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}6116{_}[Illustration: THE DEER.]
10136-8{_}6117{_}VENISON.--Far, far away in ages past, our fathers loved the     chase, and what it brought; and it is usually imagined that when     Isaac ordered his son Esau to go out with his weapons, his     quiver and his bow, and to prepare for him savoury meat, such as     he loved, that it was venison he desired.
10136-8{_}6118{_}The wise Solomon, too,     delighted in this kind of fare; for we learn that, at his table,     every day were served the wild ox, the roebuck, and the stag.
10136-8{_}6119{_}Xenophon informs us, in his History, that Cyrus, king of Persia,     ordered that venison should never be wanting at his repasts; and     of the effeminate Greeks it was the delight.
10136-8{_}6120{_}The Romans, also,     were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer; and our own     kings and princes, from the Great Alfred down to the Prince     Consort, have hunted, although, it must be confessed, under     vastly different circumstances, the swift buck, and relished     their "haunch" all the more keenly, that they had borne     themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal.
10136-8{_}6121{_}TO DRY HERBS FOR WINTER USE.
10136-8{_}6122{_}445.
10136-8{_}6123{_}On a very dry day, gather the herbs, just before they begin to flower.
10136-8{_}6124{_}If this is done when the weather is damp, the herbs will not be so good a colour.
10136-8{_}6125{_}(It is very necessary to be particular in little matters like this, for trifles constitute perfection, and herbs nicely dried will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the ground.
10136-8{_}6126{_}It is hardly necessary, however, to state that the flavour and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer.)
10136-8{_}6127{_}They should be perfectly freed from dirt and dust, and be divided into small bunches, with their roots cut off.
10136-8{_}6128{_}Dry them quickly in a very hot oven, or before the fire, as by this means most of their flavour will be preserved, and be careful not to burn them; tie them up in paper bags, and keep in a dry place.
10136-8{_}6129{_}This is a very general way of preserving dried herbs; but we would recommend the plan described in a former recipe.
10136-8{_}6130{_}_Seasonable_.--From the month of July to the end of September is the proper time for storing herbs for winter use.

10136-8{_}6140{_}445; pick the leaves from the stalks, pound them, and sift them through a hair-sieve; mix in the above proportions, and keep in glass bottles, carefully excluding the air.
10136-8{_}6141{_}This, we think, a far better method of keeping herbs, as the flavour and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely put in paper bags.
10136-8{_}6142{_}Preparing them in this way, you have them ready for use at a moment's notice.
10136-8{_}6143{_}Mint, sage, parsley, &c., dried, pounded, and each put into separate bottles, will be found very useful in winter.

10136-8{_}6146{_}The     top, which, as will be seen by the accompanying little cut, is     larger than the cork, is made of wood; and, besides effectually     covering the whole top of the bottle, can be easily removed and     again used, as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out.
10136-8{_}6147{_}SAVORY.--This we find described by Columella, a voluminous Roman     writer on agriculture, as an odoriferous herb, which, "in the     brave days of old," entered into the seasoning of nearly every     dish.
10136-8{_}6148{_}Verily, there are but few new things under the sun, and we     don't find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy, at     least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of Italy.
10136-8{_}6149{_}We possess two varieties of this aromatic herb, known to     naturalists as _Satureja_.
10136-8{_}6150{_}They are called summer and winter     savory, according to the time of the year when they are fit for     gathering.
10136-8{_}6151{_}Both sorts are in general cultivation throughout     England.
10136-8{_}6152{_}HORSERADISH SAUCE, to serve with Roast Beef.
10136-8{_}6153{_}447.
10136-8{_}6154{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard; vinegar.
10136-8{_}6155{_}_Mode_.--Grate the horseradish, and mix it well with the sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard; moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give it the consistency of cream, and serve in a tureen: 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of cream added to the above, very much improve the appearance and flavour of this sauce.
10136-8{_}6156{_}To heat it to serve with hot roast beef, put it in a bain marie or a jar, which place in a saucepan of boiling water; make it hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}6157{_}_Note_.--This sauce is a great improvement on the old-fashioned way of serving cold-scraped horseradish with hot roast beef.
10136-8{_}6158{_}The mixing of the cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything on the plate.
10136-8{_}6159{_}Of course, with cold meat, the sauce should be served cold.
10136-8{_}6160{_}[Illustration: THE HORSERADISH.]
10136-8{_}6161{_}THE HORSERADISH.--This has been, for many years, a favourite     accompaniment of roast beef, and is a native of England.
10136-8{_}6162{_}It     grows wild in wet ground, but has long been cultivated in the     garden, and is, occasionally, used in winter salads and in     sauces.
10136-8{_}6163{_}On account of the great volatility of its oil, it should     never be preserved by drying, but should be kept moist by being     buried in sand.
10136-8{_}6164{_}So rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate, that     even when scraped for the table, it almost immediately spoils by     exposure to the air.
10136-8{_}6165{_}HORSERADISH VINEGAR.
10136-8{_}6166{_}448.
10136-8{_}6167{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6168{_}of scraped horseradish, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6169{_}of minced shalot, 1 drachm of cayenne, 1 quart of vinegar.
10136-8{_}6170{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a bottle, which shake well every day for a fortnight.
10136-8{_}6171{_}When it is thoroughly steeped, strain and bottle, and it will be fit for use immediately.
10136-8{_}6172{_}This will be found an agreeable relish to cold beef, &c.
10136-8{_}6173{_}_Seasonable_.--This vinegar should be made either in October or November, as horseradish is then in its highest perfection.
10136-8{_}6174{_}INDIAN CURRY-POWDER, founded on Dr. Kitchener's Recipe.
10136-8{_}6175{_}449.
10136-8{_}6176{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6177{_}of coriander-seed, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6178{_}of turmeric, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6179{_}of cinnamon-seed, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6180{_}of cayenne, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6181{_}of mustard, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6182{_}of ground ginger, 1/2 ounce of allspice, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6183{_}of fenugreek-seed.
10136-8{_}6184{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients in a cool oven, where they should remain one night; then pound them in a mortar, rub them through a sieve, and mix thoroughly together; keep the powder in a bottle, from which the air should be completely excluded.
10136-8{_}6185{_}_Note_.--We have given this recipe for curry-powder, as some persons prefer to make it at home; but that purchased at any respectable shop is, generally speaking, far superior, and, taking all things into consideration, very frequently more economical.
10136-8{_}6186{_}INDIAN MUSTARD, an excellent Relish to Bread and Butter, or any cold Meat.
10136-8{_}6187{_}450.
10136-8{_}6188{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6189{_}of the best mustard, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6190{_}of flour, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6191{_}of salt, 4 shalots, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1/4 bottle of anchovy sauce.
10136-8{_}6192{_}_Mode_.--Put the mustard, flour, and salt into a basin, and make them into a stiff paste with boiling water.
10136-8{_}6193{_}Boil the shalots with the vinegar, ketchup, and anchovy sauce, for 10 minutes, and pour the whole, _boiling_, over the mixture in the basin; stir well, and reduce it to a proper thickness; put it into a bottle, with a bruised shalot at the bottom, and store away for use.
10136-8{_}6194{_}This makes an excellent relish, and if properly prepared will keep for years.
10136-8{_}6195{_}[Illustration: MUSTARD.]
10136-8{_}6196{_}MUSTARD.--Before the year 1729, mustard was not known at English     tables.
10136-8{_}6197{_}About that time an old woman, of the name of Clements,     residing in Durham, began to grind the seed in a mill, and to     pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the     seed from its husks.
10136-8{_}6198{_}She kept her secret for many years to     herself, during which she sold large quantities of mustard     throughout the country, but especially in London.
10136-8{_}6199{_}Here it was     introduced to the royal table, when it received the approval of     George I.
10136-8{_}6200{_}From the circumstance of Mrs. Clements being a     resident at Durham, it obtained the name of Durham mustard.
10136-8{_}6201{_}In     the county of that name it is still principally cultivated, and     the plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth.
10136-8{_}6202{_}It is     the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive     organs, and even in its previously coarsely-pounded state, had a     high reputation with our ancestors.
10136-8{_}6203{_}INDIAN PICKLE (very Superior).
10136-8{_}6204{_}451.
10136-8{_}6205{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each gallon of vinegar allow 6 cloves of garlic, 12 shalots, 2 sticks of sliced horseradish, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6206{_}of bruised ginger, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6207{_}of whole black pepper, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6208{_}of long pepper, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6209{_}of allspice, 12 cloves, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6210{_}of cayenne, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6211{_}of mustard-seed, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6212{_}of mustard, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6213{_}of turmeric; a white cabbage, cauliflowers, radish-pods, French beans, gherkins, small round pickling-onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies, &c.
10136-8{_}6214{_}_Mode_.--Cut the cabbage, which must be hard and white, into slices, and the cauliflowers into small branches; sprinkle salt over them in a large dish, and let them remain two days; then dry them, and put them into a very large jar, with garlic, shalots, horseradish, ginger, pepper, allspice, and cloves, in the above proportions.
10136-8{_}6215{_}Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, which pour over, and, when cold, cover up to keep them free from dust.
10136-8{_}6216{_}As the other things for the pickle ripen at different times, they may be added as they are ready: these will be radish-pods, French beans, gherkins, small onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies, &c. &c. As these are procured, they must, first of all, be washed in a little cold vinegar, wiped, and then simply added to the other ingredients in the large jar, only taking care that they are _covered_ by the vinegar.
10136-8{_}6217{_}If more vinegar should be wanted to add to the pickle, do not omit first to boil it before adding it to the rest.
10136-8{_}6218{_}When you have collected all the things you require, turn all out in a large pan, and thoroughly mix them.
10136-8{_}6219{_}Now put the mixed vegetables into smaller jars, without any of the vinegar; then boil the vinegar again, adding as much more as will be required to fill the different jars, and also cayenne, mustard-seed, turmeric, and mustard, which must be well mixed with a little cold vinegar, allowing the quantities named above to each gallon of vinegar.
10136-8{_}6220{_}Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle, and when cold, tie down with a bladder.
10136-8{_}6221{_}If the pickle is wanted for immediate use, the vinegar should be boiled twice more, but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next.
10136-8{_}6222{_}It will keep for years, if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar.
10136-8{_}6223{_}This recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was always pronounced excellent by all who tasted it, and who has, for many years, exactly followed the recipe given above.
10136-8{_}6224{_}__Note_.--For small families, perhaps the above quantity of pickle will be considered too large; but this may be decreased at pleasure, taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients.
10136-8{_}6225{_}[Illustration: INDIA PICKLE.]
10136-8{_}6226{_}KEEPING PICKLES.--Nothing shows more, perhaps, the difference     between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these     desirable epithets may not honestly be applied, than the     appearance of their respective store-closets.
10136-8{_}6227{_}The former is     able, the moment anything; is wanted, to put her hand on it at     once; no time is lost, no vexation incurred, no dish spoilt for     the want of "just little something,"--the latter, on the     contrary, hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook     requires, or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a     little of with his cold roast beef or mutton-chop, and vainly     seeks for the Embden groats, or arrowroot, to make one of her     little boys some gruel.
10136-8{_}6228{_}One plan, then, we strenuously advise     all who do not follow, to begin at once, and that is, to label     all their various pickles and store sauces, in the same way as     the cut here shows.
10136-8{_}6229{_}It will occupy a little time at first, but     there will be economy of it in the long run.
10136-8{_}6230{_}VINEGAR.--This term is derived from the two French words _vin     aigre_, 'sour wine,' and should, therefore, be strictly applied     to that which is made only from wine.
10136-8{_}6231{_}As the acid is the same,     however it is procured, that made from ale also takes the same     name.
10136-8{_}6232{_}Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of     vinegar.
10136-8{_}6233{_}We learn in _Ruth_, that the reapers in the East soaked     their bread in it to freshen it.
10136-8{_}6234{_}The Romans kept large     quantities of it in their cellars, using it, to a great extent,     in their seasonings and sauces.
10136-8{_}6235{_}This people attributed very     beneficial qualities to it, as it was supposed to be digestive,     antibilious, and antiscorbutic, as well as refreshing.
10136-8{_}6236{_}Spartianus, a Latin historian, tells us that, mixed with water,     it was the drink of the soldiers, and that, thanks to this     beverage, the veterans of the Roman army braved, by its use, the     inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates     of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
10136-8{_}6237{_}It is said, the Spanish peasantry,     and other inhabitants of the southern parts of Europe, still     follow this practice, and add to a gallon of water about a gill     of wine vinegar, with a little salt; and that this drink, with a     little bread, enables them, under the heat of their burning sun,     to sustain the labours of the field.
10136-8{_}6238{_}INDIAN CHETNEY SAUCE.
10136-8{_}6239{_}452.
10136-8{_}6240{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 oz.
10136-8{_}6241{_}of sharp, sour apples, pared and cored; 8 oz.
10136-8{_}6242{_}of tomatoes, 8 oz.
10136-8{_}6243{_}of salt, 8 oz.
10136-8{_}6244{_}of brown, sugar, 8 oz.
10136-8{_}6245{_}of stoned raisins, 4 oz.

10136-8{_}6247{_}of powdered ginger, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6248{_}of garlic, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6249{_}of shalots, 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 quart of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}6250{_}_Mode_.--Chop the apples in small square pieces, and add to them the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}6251{_}Mix the whole well together, and put in a well-covered jar.
10136-8{_}6252{_}Keep this in a warm place, and stir every day for a month, taking care to put on the lid after this operation; strain, but do not squeeze it dry; store it away in clean jars or bottles for use, and the liquor will serve as an excellent sauce for meat or fish.
10136-8{_}6253{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this sauce when tomatoes are in full season, that is, from the beginning of September to the end of October.
10136-8{_}6254{_}PICKLES.--The ancient Greeks and Romans held their pickles in     high estimation.
10136-8{_}6255{_}They consisted of flowers, herbs, roots, and     vegetables, preserved in vinegar, and which were kept, for a     long time, in cylindrical vases with wide mouths.
10136-8{_}6256{_}Their cooks     prepared pickles with the greatest care, and the various     ingredients were macerated in oil, brine, and vinegar, with     which they were often impregnated drop by drop.
10136-8{_}6257{_}Meat, also,     after having been cut into very small pieces, was treated in the     same manner.
10136-8{_}6258{_}ITALIAN SAUCE (Brown).

10136-8{_}6261{_}105, 1/2 glass of Madeira, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.
10136-8{_}6262{_}_Mode_.--Put the stock into a stewpan with the mushrooms, shalots, and Madeira, and stew gently for 1/4 hour, then add the remaining ingredients, and let them just boil.

10136-8{_}6264{_}(_See_ No.
10136-8{_}6265{_}430.)
10136-8{_}6266{_}The mushrooms should not be chopped long before they are wanted, as they will then become black.

10136-8{_}6268{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.
10136-8{_}6269{_}_Sufficient_ for a small dish.
10136-8{_}6270{_}ITALIAN SAUCE (White).
10136-8{_}6271{_}454.
10136-8{_}6272{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No.
10136-8{_}6273{_}107; 2 tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of chopped shalots, 1 slice of ham, minced very fine; 1/4 pint of Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}6274{_}367; salt to taste, a few drops of garlic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a squeeze of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}6275{_}_Mode_.--Put the shalots and mushrooms into a stewpan with the stock and ham, and simmer very gently for 1/2 hour, when add the Béchamel.
10136-8{_}6276{_}Let it just boil up, and then strain it through a tammy; season with the above ingredients, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}6277{_}If this sauce should not have retained a nice white colour, a little cream may be added.
10136-8{_}6278{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}6279{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 10d.
10136-8{_}6280{_}_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.
10136-8{_}6281{_}_Note_.--To preserve the colour of the mushrooms after pickling, throw them into water to which a little lemon-juice has been added.
10136-8{_}6282{_}TO PICKLE LEMONS WITH THE PEEL ON.
10136-8{_}6283{_}455.
10136-8{_}6284{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 2 quarts of boiling water; to each quart of vinegar allow 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6285{_}of cloves, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6286{_}of white pepper, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6287{_}of bruised ginger, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6288{_}of mace and chilies, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6289{_}of mustard-seed, 1/2 stick of sliced horseradish, a few cloves of garlic.
10136-8{_}6290{_}_Mode_.--Put the lemons into a brine that will bear an egg; let them remain in it 6 days, stirring them every day; have ready 2 quarts of boiling water, put in the lemons, and allow them to boil for 1/4 hour; take them out, and let them lie in a cloth until perfectly dry and cold.
10136-8{_}6291{_}Boil up sufficient vinegar to cover the lemons, with all the above ingredients, allowing the same proportion as stated to each quart of vinegar.
10136-8{_}6292{_}Pack the lemons in a jar, pour over the vinegar, &c. boiling hot, and tie down with a bladder.
10136-8{_}6293{_}They will be fit for use in about 12 months, or rather sooner.
10136-8{_}6294{_}_Seasonable_.--This should be made from November to April.
10136-8{_}6295{_}THE LEMON.--In the earlier ages of the world, the lemon does not     appear to have been at all known, and the Romans only became     acquainted with it at a very late period, and then only used it     to keep moths from their garments.
10136-8{_}6296{_}Its acidity would seem to     have been unpleasant to them; and in Pliny's time, at the     commencement of the Christian era, this fruit was hardly     accepted, otherwise than as an excellent antidote against the     effects of poison.
10136-8{_}6297{_}Many anecdotes have been related concerning     the anti-venomous properties of the lemon; Athenaeus, a Latin     writer, telling us, that on one occasion, two men felt no     effects from the bites of dangerous serpents, because they had     previously eaten of this fruit.
10136-8{_}6298{_}TO PICKLE LEMONS WITHOUT THE PEEL.
10136-8{_}6299{_}456.
10136-8{_}6300{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}6301{_}of fine salt; to each quart of vinegar, the same ingredients as No.
10136-8{_}6302{_}455.
10136-8{_}6303{_}_Mode_.--Peel the lemons, slit each one down 3 times, so as not to divide them, and rub the salt well into the divisions; place them in a pan, where they must remain for a week, turning them every other day; then put them in a Dutch oven before a clear fire until the salt has become perfectly dry; then arrange them in a jar.
10136-8{_}6304{_}Pour over sufficient boiling vinegar to cover them, to which have been added the ingredients mentioned in the foregoing recipe; tie down closely, and in about 9 months they will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}6305{_}_Seasonable_.--The best time to make this is from November to April.
10136-8{_}6306{_}_Note_.--After this pickle has been made from 4 to 5 months, the liquor may be strained and bottled, and will be found an excellent lemon ketchup.
10136-8{_}6307{_}LEMON-JUICE.--Citric acid is the principal component part of     lemon-juice, which, in addition to the agreeableness of its     flavour, is also particularly cooling and grateful.
10136-8{_}6308{_}It is     likewise an antiscorbutic; and this quality enhances its value.
10136-8{_}6309{_}In order to combat the fatal effects of scurvy amongst the crews     of ships at sea, a regular allowance of lemon-juice is served     out to the men; and by this practice, the disease has almost     entirely disappeared.
10136-8{_}6310{_}By putting the juice into bottles, and     pouring on the top sufficient oil to cover it, it may be     preserved for a considerable time.
10136-8{_}6311{_}Italy and Turkey export great     quantities of it in this manner.
10136-8{_}6312{_}LEMON SAUCE FOR BOILED FOWLS.
10136-8{_}6313{_}457.
10136-8{_}6314{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 small lemon, 3/4 pint of melted butter, No.
10136-8{_}6315{_}380.
10136-8{_}6316{_}_Mode_.--Cut the lemon into very thin slices, and these again into very small dice.
10136-8{_}6317{_}Have ready 3/4 pint of melted butter, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}6318{_}380; put in the lemon; let it just simmer, but not boil, and pour it over the fowls.

10136-8{_}6320{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}6321{_}_Sufficient_ for a pair of large fowls.
10136-8{_}6322{_}LEMON WHITE SAUCE, FOR FOWLS, FRICASSEES, &c.  458.
10136-8{_}6323{_}INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of cream, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole white pepper, 1 sprig of lemon thyme, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}6324{_}of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 teacupful of white stock; salt to taste.
10136-8{_}6325{_}_Mode_.--Put the cream into a very clean saucepan (a lined one is best), with the lemon-peel, pepper, and thyme, and let these infuse for 1/2 hour, when simmer gently for a few minutes, or until there is a nice flavour of lemon.
10136-8{_}6326{_}Strain it, and add a thickening of butter and flour in the above proportions; stir this well in, and put in the lemon-juice at the moment of serving; mix the stock with the cream, and add a little salt.
10136-8{_}6327{_}This sauce should not boil after the cream and stock are mixed together.
10136-8{_}6328{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}6329{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}6330{_}6d.
10136-8{_}6331{_}_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a pair of large boiled fowls.
10136-8{_}6332{_}_Note_.--Where the expense of the cream is objected to, milk may be substituted for it.
10136-8{_}6333{_}In this case, an additional dessertspoonful, or rather more, of flour must be added.
10136-8{_}6334{_}[Illustration: LEMON THYME.]
10136-8{_}6335{_}LEMON THYME.--Two or three tufts of this species of thyme,     _Thymus citriodorus_, usually find a place in the herb     compartment of the kitchen-garden.
10136-8{_}6336{_}It is a trailing evergreen,     is of smaller growth than the common kind (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}6337{_}166), and     is remarkable for its smell, which closely resembles that of the     rind of a lemon.
10136-8{_}6338{_}Hence its distinctive name.
10136-8{_}6339{_}It is used for some     particular dishes, in which the fragrance of the lemon is     desired to slightly predominate.

10136-8{_}6342{_})_  459.
10136-8{_}6343{_}INGREDIENTS.--Walnuts.
10136-8{_}6344{_}To each quart of walnut-juice allow 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 pint of Indian soy, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6345{_}of cayenne, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6346{_}of shalots, 3/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6347{_}of garlic, 1/2 pint of port wine.
10136-8{_}6348{_}_Mode_.--Be very particular in choosing the walnuts as soon as they appear in the market; for they are more easily bruised before they become hard and shelled.
10136-8{_}6349{_}Pound them in a mortar to a pulp, strew some salt over them, and let them remain thus for two or three days, occasionally stirring and moving them about.
10136-8{_}6350{_}Press out the juice, and to _each quart_ of walnut-liquor allow the above proportion of vinegar, soy, cayenne, shalots, garlic, and port wine.
10136-8{_}6351{_}Pound each ingredient separately in a mortar, then mix them well together, and store away for use in small bottles.
10136-8{_}6352{_}The corks should be well sealed.
10136-8{_}6353{_}_Seasonable_.--This sauce should be made as soon as walnuts are obtainable, from the beginning to the middle of July.
10136-8{_}6354{_}LEMON BRANDY.
10136-8{_}6355{_}460.
10136-8{_}6356{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of brandy, the rind of two small lemons, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6357{_}of loaf-sugar, 1/4 pint of water.
10136-8{_}6358{_}_Mode_.--Peel the lemons rather thin, taking care to have none of the white pith.
10136-8{_}6359{_}Put the rinds into a bottle with the brandy, and let them infuse for 24 hours, when they should be strained.
10136-8{_}6360{_}Now boil the sugar with the water for a few minutes, skim it, and, when cold, add it to the brandy.
10136-8{_}6361{_}A dessertspoonful of this will be found an excellent flavouring for boiled custards.
10136-8{_}6362{_}LEMON RIND OR PEEL.--This contains an essential oil of a very     high flavour and fragrance, and is consequently esteemed both a     wholesome and agreeable stomachic.
10136-8{_}6363{_}It is used, as will be seen     by many recipes in this book, as an ingredient for flavouring a     number of various dishes.
10136-8{_}6364{_}Under the name of CANDIED LEMON-PEEL,     it is cleared of the pulp and preserved by sugar, when it     becomes an excellent sweetmeat.
10136-8{_}6365{_}By the ancient medical     philosopher Galen, and others, it may be added, that dried     lemon-peel was considered as one of the best digestives, and     recommended to weak and delicate persons.
10136-8{_}6366{_}LIAISON OF EGGS FOR THICKENING SAUCES.
10136-8{_}6367{_}461.
10136-8{_}6368{_}INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 3 eggs, 8 tablespoonfuls of milk or cream.
10136-8{_}6369{_}_Mode_.--Beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add the milk, and strain the whole through a hair-sieve.
10136-8{_}6370{_}When the liaison is being added to the sauce it is intended to thicken, care must be exercised to keep stirring it during the whole time, or, otherwise, the eggs will curdle.
10136-8{_}6371{_}It should only just simmer, but not boil.

10136-8{_}6374{_}INGREDIENTS.--The liver of a fowl, one lemon, salt to taste, 1/2 pint of melted butter.
10136-8{_}6375{_}No.
10136-8{_}6376{_}376.
10136-8{_}6377{_}_Mode_.--Wash the liver, and let it boil for a few minutes; peel the lemon very thin, remove the white part and pips, and cut it into very small dice; mince the liver and a small quantity of the lemon rind very fine; add these ingredients to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter; season with a little salt, put in the cut lemon, heat it gradually, but do not allow it to boil, lest the butter should oil.
10136-8{_}6378{_}_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.
10136-8{_}6379{_}_Sufficient_ to serve with a pair of small fowls.
10136-8{_}6380{_}LIVER AND PARSLEY SAUCE FOR POULTRY.
10136-8{_}6381{_}463.
10136-8{_}6382{_}INGREDIENTS.--The liver of a fowl, one tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1/2 pint of melted butter, No.
10136-8{_}6383{_}376.
10136-8{_}6384{_}_Mode_.--Wash and score the liver, boil it for a few minutes, and mince it very fine; blanch or scald a small bunch of parsley, of which there should be sufficient when chopped to fill a tablespoon; add this, with the minced liver, to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter; let it just boil; when serve.
10136-8{_}6385{_}_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.
10136-8{_}6386{_}_Sufficient_ for a pair of small fowls.
10136-8{_}6387{_}LOBSTER SAUCE, to serve with Turbot, Salmon, Brill, &c.  (_Very Good_.)
10136-8{_}6388{_}464.
10136-8{_}6389{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 middling-sized hen lobster, 3/4 pint of melted butter, No.
10136-8{_}6390{_}376; 1 tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6391{_}of butter, salt and cayenne to taste, a little pounded mace when liked, 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of cream.
10136-8{_}6392{_}_Mode_.--Choose a hen lobster, as this is indispensable, in order to render this sauce as good as it ought to be.
10136-8{_}6393{_}Pick the meat from the shells, and cut it into small square pieces; put the spawn, which will be found under the tail of the lobster, into a mortar with 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6394{_}of butter, and pound it quite smooth; rub it through a hair-sieve, and cover up till wanted.
10136-8{_}6395{_}Make 3/4 pint of melted butter by recipe No.
10136-8{_}6396{_}376; put in all the ingredients except the lobster-meat, and well mix the sauce before the lobster is added to it, as it should retain its square form, and not come to table shredded and ragged.
10136-8{_}6397{_}Put in the meat, let it get thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, as the colour would immediately be spoiled; for it should be remembered that this sauce should always have a bright red appearance.
10136-8{_}6398{_}If it is intended to be served with turbot or brill, a little of the spawn (dried and rubbed through a sieve without butter) should be saved to garnish with; but as the goodness, flavour, and appearance of the sauce so much depend on having a proper quantity of spawn, the less used for garnishing the better.
10136-8{_}6399{_}_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.
10136-8{_}6400{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s.
10136-8{_}6401{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}6402{_}_Sufficient_ to serve with a small turbot, a brill, or salmon for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}6403{_}_Note_.--Melted butter made with milk, No.
10136-8{_}6404{_}380, will be found to answer very well for lobster sauce, as by employing it a nice white colour will be obtained.
10136-8{_}6405{_}Less quantity than the above may be made by using a very small lobster, to which add only 1/2 pint of melted butter, and season as above.
10136-8{_}6406{_}Where economy is desired, the cream may be dispensed with, and the remains of a cold lobster left from table, may, with a little care, be converted into a very good sauce.

10136-8{_}6419{_}THE MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL.--The house-steward of England is synonymous     with the maître d'hôtel of France; and, in ancient times,     amongst the Latins, he was called procurator, or major-domo.
10136-8{_}6420{_}In     Rome, the slaves, after they had procured the various articles     necessary for the repasts of the day, would return to the     spacious kitchen laden with meat, game, sea-fish, vegetables,     fruit, &c. Each one would then lay his basket at the feet of the     major-domo, who would examine its contents and register them on     his tablets, placing in the pantry contiguous to the     dining-room, those of the provisions which need no preparation,     and consigning the others to the more immediate care of the     cooks.

10136-8{_}6424{_}of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 heaped tablespoonful of chopped parsley; salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste; the juice of 1/2 large lemon, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}6425{_}_Mode_.--Put at the bottom of a stewpan the minced ham, and over it the poultry-trimmings (if these are not at hand, veal should be substituted), with the shalots, garlic, and bay-leaf.
10136-8{_}6426{_}Pour in the water, and let the whole simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the liquor is reduced to a full 1/2 pint.
10136-8{_}6427{_}Then strain this gravy, put it in another saucepan, make a thickening of butter and flour in the above proportions, and stir it to the gravy over a nice clear fire, until it is perfectly smooth and rather thick, care being taken that the butter does not float on the surface.
10136-8{_}6428{_}Skim well, add the remaining ingredients, let the sauce gradually heat, but do not allow it to boil.
10136-8{_}6429{_}If this sauce is intended for an entrée, it is necessary to make it of a sufficient thickness, so that it may adhere to what it is meant to cover.

10136-8{_}6446{_}INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and white pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of white stock, No.
10136-8{_}6447{_}107, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream.
10136-8{_}6448{_}_Mode_.--Put the yolks of the eggs into a basin, with a seasoning of pepper and salt; have ready the above quantities of oil and vinegar, in separate vessels; add them _very gradually_ to the eggs; continue stirring and rubbing the mixture with a wooden spoon, as herein consists the secret of having a nice smooth sauce.
10136-8{_}6449{_}It cannot be stirred too frequently, and it should be made in a very cool place, or, if ice is at hand, it should be mixed over it.
10136-8{_}6450{_}When the vinegar and oil are well incorporated with the eggs, add the stock and cream, stirring all the time, and it will then be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6451{_}For a fish Mayonnaise, this sauce may be coloured with lobster-spawn, pounded; and for poultry or meat, where variety is desired, a little parsley-juice may be used to add to its appearance.
10136-8{_}6452{_}Cucumber, Tarragon, or any other flavoured vinegar, may be substituted for plain, where they are liked.
10136-8{_}6453{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.
10136-8{_}6454{_}_Sufficient_ for a small salad.
10136-8{_}6455{_}_Note_.--In mixing the oil and vinegar with the eggs, put in first a few drops of oil, and then a few drops of vinegar, never adding a large quantity of either at one time.
10136-8{_}6456{_}By this means, you can be more certain of the sauce not curdling.
10136-8{_}6457{_}Patience and practice, let us add, are two essentials for making this sauce good.
10136-8{_}6458{_}MINT SAUCE, to serve with Roast Lamb.

10136-8{_}6460{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 dessertspoonfuls of chopped mint, 2 dessertspoonfuls of pounded white sugar, 1/4 pint of vinegar.
10136-8{_}6461{_}_Mode_.--Wash the mint, which should be young and fresh-gathered, free from grit; pick the leaves from the stalks, mince them very fine, and put them into a tureen; add the sugar and vinegar, and stir till the former is dissolved.
10136-8{_}6462{_}This sauce is better by being made 2 or 3 hours before wanted for table, as the vinegar then becomes impregnated with the flavour of the mint.
10136-8{_}6463{_}By many persons, the above proportion of sugar would not be considered sufficient; but as tastes vary, we have given the quantity which we have found to suit the general palate.
10136-8{_}6464{_}_Average cost_, 3d.
10136-8{_}6465{_}_Sufficient_ to serve with a middling-sized joint of lamb.
10136-8{_}6466{_}_Note_.--Where green mint is scarce and not obtainable, mint vinegar may be substituted for it, and will be found very acceptable in early spring.
10136-8{_}6467{_}[Illustration: MINT.]
10136-8{_}6468{_}MINT.--The common mint cultivated in our gardens is known as the     _Mentha viridis_, and is employed in different culinary     processes, being sometimes boiled with certain dishes, and     afterwards withdrawn.
10136-8{_}6469{_}It has an agreeable aromatic flavour, and     forms an ingredient in soups, and sometimes is used in spring     salads.
10136-8{_}6470{_}It is valuable as a stomachic and antispasmodic; on     which account it is generally served at table with pea-soup.
10136-8{_}6471{_}Several of its species grow wild in low situations in the     country.
10136-8{_}6472{_}MINT VINEGAR.
10136-8{_}6473{_}470.
10136-8{_}6474{_}INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar, mint.
10136-8{_}6475{_}_Mode_.--Procure some nice fresh mint, pick the leaves from the stalks, and fill a bottle or jar with them.
10136-8{_}6476{_}Add vinegar to them until the bottle is full; _cover closely_ to exclude the air, and let it infuse for a fortnight.
10136-8{_}6477{_}Then strain the liquor, and put it into small bottles for use, of which the corks should be sealed.

10136-8{_}6480{_}(_Very Good_.)
10136-8{_}6481{_}471.

10136-8{_}6484{_}of mustard, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6485{_}of salt, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6486{_}of mustard-seed, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6487{_}of turmeric, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6488{_}of ground black pepper, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6489{_}of cayenne, cauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucumbers, gherkins, French beans, nasturtiums, capsicums.
10136-8{_}6490{_}_Mode_.--Have a large jar, with a tightly-fitting lid, in which put as much vinegar as required, reserving a little to mix the various powders to a smooth paste.
10136-8{_}6491{_}Put into a basin the mustard, turmeric, pepper, and cayenne; mix them with vinegar, and stir well until no lumps remain; add all the ingredients to the vinegar, and mix well.
10136-8{_}6492{_}Keep this liquor in a warm place, and thoroughly stir every morning for a month with a wooden spoon, when it will be ready for the different vegetables to be added to it.
10136-8{_}6493{_}As these come into season, have them gathered on a dry day, and, after merely wiping them with a cloth, to free them from moisture, put them into the pickle.
10136-8{_}6494{_}The cauliflowers, it may be said, must be divided into small bunches.
10136-8{_}6495{_}Put all these into the pickle raw, and at the end of the season, when there have been added as many of the vegetables as could be procured, store it away in jars, and tie over with bladder.
10136-8{_}6496{_}As none of the ingredients are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat till 12 months have elapsed.
10136-8{_}6497{_}Whilst the pickle is being made, keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar; and its contents, it may be repeated, must be stirred every morning.
10136-8{_}6498{_}_Seasonable_.--Make the pickle-liquor in May or June, as the season arrives for the various vegetables to be picked.
10136-8{_}6499{_}MUSHROOM KETCHUP.
10136-8{_}6500{_}472.
10136-8{_}6501{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each peck of mushrooms 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}6502{_}of salt; to each quart of mushroom-liquor 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6503{_}of cayenne, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6504{_}of allspice, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6505{_}of ginger, 2 blades of pounded mace.
10136-8{_}6506{_}_Mode_.--Choose full-grown mushroom-flaps, and take care they are perfectly _fresh-gathered_ when the weather is tolerably dry; for, if they are picked during very heavy rain, the ketchup from which they are made is liable to get musty, and will not keep long.
10136-8{_}6507{_}Put a layer of them in a deep pan, sprinkle salt over them, and then another layer of mushrooms, and so on alternately.
10136-8{_}6508{_}Let them remain for a few hours, when break them up with the hand; put them in a nice cool place for 3 days, occasionally stirring and mashing them well, to extract from them as much juice as possible.
10136-8{_}6509{_}Now measure the quantity of liquor without straining, and to each quart allow the above proportion of spices, &c. Put all into a stone jar, cover it up very closely, put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it over the fire, and let it boil for 3 hours.
10136-8{_}6510{_}Have ready a nice clean stewpan; turn into it the contents of the jar, and let the whole simmer very gently for 1/2 hour; pour it into a jug, where it should stand in a cool place till the next day; then pour it off into another jug, and strain it into very dry clean bottles, and do not squeeze the mushrooms.
10136-8{_}6511{_}To each pint of ketchup add a few drops of brandy.
10136-8{_}6512{_}Be careful not to shake the contents, but leave all the sediment behind in the jug; cork well, and either seal or rosin the cork, so as perfectly to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}6513{_}When a very clear bright ketchup is wanted, the liquor must be strained through a very fine hair-sieve, or flannel bag, _after_ it has been very gently poured off; if the operation is not successful, it must be repeated until you have quite a clear liquor.
10136-8{_}6514{_}It should be examined occasionally, and if it is spoiling, should be reboiled with a few peppercorns.
10136-8{_}6515{_}_Seasonable_ from the beginning of September to the middle of October, when this ketchup should be made.
10136-8{_}6516{_}_Note_.--This flavouring ingredient, if genuine and well prepared, is one of the most useful store sauces to the experienced cook, and no trouble should be spared in its preparation.
10136-8{_}6517{_}Double ketchup is made by reducing the liquor to half the quantity; for example, 1 quart must be boiled down to 1 pint.
10136-8{_}6518{_}This goes farther than ordinary ketchup, as so little is required to flavour a good quantity of gravy.
10136-8{_}6519{_}The sediment may also be bottled for immediate use, and will be found to answer for flavouring thick soups or gravies.
10136-8{_}6520{_}HOW TO DISTINGUISH MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.--The cultivated     mushroom, known as _Agaricus campestris_, may be distinguished     from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or     flesh-coloured gills, or under-side, and by its invariably     having an agreeable smell, which the toadstool has not.
10136-8{_}6521{_}When     young, mushrooms are like a small round button, both the stalk     and head being white.
10136-8{_}6522{_}As they grow larger, they expand their     heads by degrees into a flat form, the gills underneath being at     first of a pale flesh-colour, but becoming, as they stand     longer, dark brown or blackish.
10136-8{_}6523{_}Nearly all the poisonous kinds     are brown, and have in general a rank and putrid smell.
10136-8{_}6524{_}Edible     mushrooms are found in closely-fed pastures, but seldom grow in     woods, where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found.
10136-8{_}6525{_}TO DRY MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}6526{_}473.
10136-8{_}6527{_}_Mode_.--Wipe them clean, take away the brown part, and peel off the skin; lay them on sheets of paper to dry, in a cool oven, when they will shrivel considerably.
10136-8{_}6528{_}Keep them in paper bags, which hang in a dry place.
10136-8{_}6529{_}When wanted for use, put them into cold gravy, bring them gradually to simmer, and it will be found that they will regain nearly their usual size.
10136-8{_}6530{_}[Illustration: THE MUSHROOM.]
10136-8{_}6531{_}THE MUSHROOM.--The cultivated or garden mushroom is a species of     fungus, which, in England, is considered the best, and is there     usually eaten.
10136-8{_}6532{_}The tribe, however, is numerous, and a large     proportion of them are poisonous; hence it is always dangerous     to make use of mushrooms gathered in their wild state.
10136-8{_}6533{_}In some     parts of Europe, as in Germany, Russia, and Poland, many species     grow wild, and are used as food; but in Britain, two only are     generally eaten.
10136-8{_}6534{_}These are mostly employed for the flavouring of     dishes, and are also dried and pickled.
10136-8{_}6535{_}CATSUP, or KETCHUP, is     made from them by mixing spices and salt with their juice.
10136-8{_}6536{_}The     young, called buttons, are the best for pickling when in the     globular form.
10136-8{_}6537{_}BROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Roast Meat, &c.  474.
10136-8{_}6538{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of button mushrooms, 1/2 pint of good beef gravy, No.
10136-8{_}6539{_}435, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup (if at hand), thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}6540{_}_Mode_.--Put the gravy into a saucepan, thicken it, and stir over the fire until it boils.
10136-8{_}6541{_}Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks and wiping them free from grit and dirt; the large flap mushrooms cut into small pieces will answer for a brown sauce, when the buttons are not obtainable; put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very gently for about 10 minutes; then add the ketchup, and serve.
10136-8{_}6542{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}6543{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}6544{_}_Note_.--When fresh mushrooms are not obtainable, the powder No.
10136-8{_}6545{_}477 may be used as a substitute for brown sauce.
10136-8{_}6546{_}WHITE MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Boiled Fowls, Cutlets, &c.  I.
10136-8{_}6547{_}475.
10136-8{_}6548{_}INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1/2 pint of button mushrooms, lemon-juice and water, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6549{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}6550{_}367, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}6551{_}_Mode_.--Turn the mushrooms white by putting them into lemon-juice and water, having previously cut off the stalks and wiped them perfectly free from grit.
10136-8{_}6552{_}Chop them, and put them in a stewpan with the butter.
10136-8{_}6553{_}When the mushrooms are softened, add the Béchamel, and simmer for about 5 minutes; should they, however, not be done enough, allow rather more time.
10136-8{_}6554{_}They should not boil longer than necessary, as they would then lose their colour and flavour.
10136-8{_}6555{_}Rub the whole through a tammy, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}6556{_}After this, it should be warmed in a bain marie.
10136-8{_}6557{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}6558{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}6559{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}6560{_}II.
10136-8{_}6561{_}_A More Simple Method_.
10136-8{_}6562{_}476.
10136-8{_}6563{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, made with milk, No.
10136-8{_}6564{_}380; 1/2 pint of button mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup, if at hand; cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}6565{_}_Mode_.--Make the melted butter by recipe No.
10136-8{_}6566{_}380, and add to it the mushrooms, which must be nicely cleaned, and free from grit, and the stalks cut off.
10136-8{_}6567{_}Let them simmer gently for about 10 minutes, or until they are quite tender.
10136-8{_}6568{_}Put in the seasoning and ketchup; let it just boil, when serve.
10136-8{_}6569{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}6570{_}_Average cost_, 8d.
10136-8{_}6571{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}6572{_}GROWTH OF THE MUSHROOM AND OTHER FUNGI.--The quick growth of the     mushroom and other fungi is no less wonderful than the length of     time they live, and the numerous dangers they resist while they     continue in the dormant state.
10136-8{_}6573{_}To spring up "like a mushroom in     a night" is a scriptural mode of expressing celerity; and this     completely accords with all the observations which have been     made concerning this curious class of plants.
10136-8{_}6574{_}Mr. Sowerby     remarks--"I have often placed specimens of the _Phallus caninus_     by a window over-night, while in the egg-form, and they have     been fully grown by the morning."
10136-8{_}6575{_}MUSHROOM POWDER (a valuable addition to Sauces and Gravies, when fresh Mushrooms are not obtainable).
10136-8{_}6576{_}477.
10136-8{_}6577{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 peck of large mushrooms, 2 onions, 12 cloves, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6578{_}of pounded mace, 2 teaspoonfuls of white pepper.
10136-8{_}6579{_}_Mode_.--Peel the mushrooms, wipe them perfectly free from grit and dirt, remove the black fur, and reject all those that are at all worm-eaten; put them into a stewpan with the above ingredients, but without water; shake them over a clear fire, till all the liquor is dried up, and be careful not to let them burn; arrange them on tins, and dry them in a slow oven; pound them to a fine powder, which put into small _dry_ bottles; cork well, seal the corks, and keep it in a dry place.
10136-8{_}6580{_}In using this powder, add it to the gravy just before serving, when it will merely require one boil-up.
10136-8{_}6581{_}The flavour imparted by this means to the gravy, ought to be exceedingly good.
10136-8{_}6582{_}_Seasonable_.--This should be made in September, or at the beginning of October.
10136-8{_}6583{_}_Note_.--If the bottles in which it is stored away are not perfectly dry, as, also the mushroom powder, it will keep good but a very short time.
10136-8{_}6584{_}PICKLED MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}6585{_}478.
10136-8{_}6586{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each quart of mushrooms, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6587{_}of ground pepper, salt to taste.
10136-8{_}6588{_}_Mode_.--Choose some nice young button mushrooms for pickling, and rub off the skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks; if very large, take out the red inside, and reject the black ones, as they are too old.
10136-8{_}6589{_}Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle salt over them, with pounded mace and pepper in the above proportion; shake them well over a clear fire until the liquor flows, and keep them there until it is all dried up again; then add as much vinegar as will cover them; just let it simmer for 1 minute, and store it away in stone jars for use.
10136-8{_}6590{_}When cold, tie down with bladder and keep in a dry place; they will remain good for a length of time, and are generally considered delicious.
10136-8{_}6591{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this the same time as ketchup, from the beginning of September to the middle of October.
10136-8{_}6592{_}NATURE OF THE MUSHROOM.--Locality has evidently a considerable     influence on the nature of the juices of the mushroom; for it     has been discovered, after fatal experience, that some species,     which are perfectly harmless when raised in open meadows and     pasturelands, become virulently poisonous when they happen to     grow in contact with stagnant water or putrescent animal and     vegetable substances.
10136-8{_}6593{_}What the precise nature of the poison in     fungi may be, has not been accurately ascertained.
10136-8{_}6594{_}A VERY RICH AND GOOD MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Fowls or Rabbits.
10136-8{_}6595{_}479.
10136-8{_}6596{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 pint of cream, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6597{_}of butter, flour to thicken.
10136-8{_}6598{_}_Mode_.--Rub the buttons with a piece of flannel and salt, to take off the skin; cut off the stalks, and put them in a stewpan with the above ingredients, previously kneading together the butter and flour; boil the whole for about ten minutes, stirring all the time.
10136-8{_}6599{_}Pour some of the sauce over the fowls, and the remainder serve in a tureen.
10136-8{_}6600{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}6601{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}6602{_}_Sufficient_ to serve with a pair of fowls.
10136-8{_}6603{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}6604{_}HOW TO MIX MUSTARD.
10136-8{_}6605{_}480.
10136-8{_}6606{_}INGREDIENTS.--Mustard, salt, and water.
10136-8{_}6607{_}_Mode_.--Mustard should be mixed with water that has been boiled and allowed to cool; hot water destroys its essential properties, and raw cold water might cause it to ferment.
10136-8{_}6608{_}Put the mustard in a cup, with a small pinch of salt, and mix with it very gradually sufficient boiled water to make it drop from the spoon without being watery.
10136-8{_}6609{_}Stir and mix well, and rub the lumps well down with the back of a spoon, as well-mixed mustard should be perfectly free from these.
10136-8{_}6610{_}The mustard-pot should not be more than half full, or rather less if it will not be used in a day or two, as it is so much better when freshly mixed.
10136-8{_}6611{_}TARTAR MUSTARD.
10136-8{_}6612{_}481.
10136-8{_}6613{_}INGREDIENTS.--Horseradish vinegar, cayenne, 1/2 a teacupful of mustard.
10136-8{_}6614{_}_Mode_.--Have ready sufficient horseradish vinegar to mix with the above proportion of mustard; put the mustard in a cup, with a slight seasoning of cayenne; mix it perfectly smooth with the vinegar, adding this a little at a time; rub down with the back of a spoon any lumps that may appear, and do not let it be too thin.
10136-8{_}6615{_}Mustard may be flavoured in various ways, with Tarragon, shalot, celery, and many other vinegars, herbs, spices, &c.; but this is more customary in France than in England, as there it is merely considered a "vehicle of flavours," as it has been termed.
10136-8{_}6616{_}PICKLED NASTURTIUMS (a very good Substitute for Capers)  482.
10136-8{_}6617{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each pint of vinegar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6618{_}of salt, 6 peppercorns, nasturtiums.
10136-8{_}6619{_}_Mode_.--Gather the nasturtium-pods on a dry day, and wipe them clean with a cloth; put them in a dry glass bottle, with vinegar, salt, and pepper in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}6620{_}If you cannot find enough ripe to fill a bottle, cork up what you have got until you have some more fit: they may be added from day to day.
10136-8{_}6621{_}Bung up the bottles, and seal or rosin the tops.
10136-8{_}6622{_}They will be fit for use in 10 or 12 months; and the best way is to make them one season for the next.
10136-8{_}6623{_}_Seasonable_.--Look for nasturtium-pods from the end of July to the end of August.
10136-8{_}6624{_}[Illustration: NASTURTIUMS.]
10136-8{_}6625{_}NASTURTIUMS.--The elegant nasturtium-plant, called by     naturalists _Tropoeolum_, and which sometimes goes by the name     of Indian cress, came originally from Peru, but was easily made     to grow in these islands.
10136-8{_}6626{_}Its young leaves and flowers are of a     slightly hot nature, and many consider them a good adjunct to     salads, to which they certainly add a pretty appearance.
10136-8{_}6627{_}When     the beautiful blossoms, which may be employed with great effect     in garnishing dishes, are off, then the fruit is used as     described in the above recipe.
10136-8{_}6628{_}FRENCH ONION SAUCE, or SOUBISE.
10136-8{_}6629{_}483.
10136-8{_}6630{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}6631{_}367, 1 bay-leaf, seasoning to taste of pounded mace and cayenne, 6 onions, a small piece of ham.
10136-8{_}6632{_}_Mode_.--Peel the onions and cut them in halves; put them in a stewpan, with just sufficient water to cover them, and add the bay-leaf, ham, cayenne, and mace; be careful to keep the lid closely shut, and simmer them until tender.
10136-8{_}6633{_}Take them out and drain thoroughly; rub them through a tammy or sieve (an old one does for the purpose) with a wooden spoon, and put them to 1/2 pint of Béchamel; keep stirring over the fire until it boils, when serve.
10136-8{_}6634{_}If it should require any more seasoning, add it to taste.
10136-8{_}6635{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour to boil the onions.
10136-8{_}6636{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}6637{_}for this quantity.
10136-8{_}6638{_}_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.
10136-8{_}6639{_}WHITE ONION SAUCE, for Boiled Rabbits, Roast Shoulder of Mutton, &c.  484.
10136-8{_}6640{_}INGREDIENTS.--9 large onions, or 12 middling-sized ones, 1 pint of melted butter made with milk (No.
10136-8{_}6641{_}380), 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, or rather more.
10136-8{_}6642{_}_Mode_.--Peel the onions and put them into water to which a little salt has been added, to preserve their whiteness, and let them remain for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}6643{_}Then put them in a stewpan, cover them with water, and let them boil until tender, and, if the onions should be very strong, change the water after they have been boiling for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}6644{_}Drain them thoroughly, chop them, and rub them through a tammy or sieve.
10136-8{_}6645{_}Make 1 pint of melted butter, by recipe No.
10136-8{_}6646{_}380, and when that boils, put in the onions, with a seasoning of salt; stir it till it simmers, when it will be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}6647{_}If these directions are carefully attended to, this onion sauce will be delicious.
10136-8{_}6648{_}_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour, to boil the onions.
10136-8{_}6649{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}6650{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}6651{_}_Sufficient_ to serve with a roast shoulder of mutton, or boiled rabbit.
10136-8{_}6652{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March.
10136-8{_}6653{_}_Note_.--To make this sauce very mild and delicate, use Spanish onions, which can be procured from the beginning of September to Christmas.
10136-8{_}6654{_}2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of cream added just before serving, will be found to improve its appearance very much.
10136-8{_}6655{_}Small onions, when very young, may be cooked whole, and served in melted butter.
10136-8{_}6656{_}A sieve or tammy should be kept expressly for onions: an old one answers the purpose, as it is liable to retain the flavour and smell, which of course would be excessively disagreeable in delicate preparations.
10136-8{_}6657{_}BROWN ONION SAUCE.
10136-8{_}6658{_}485.
10136-8{_}6659{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 large onions, rather more than 1/2 pint of good gravy, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6660{_}of butter, salt and pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}6661{_}_Mode_.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown in a stewpan, with the above quantity of butter, keeping them well stirred, that they do not get black.
10136-8{_}6662{_}When a nice colour, pour over the gravy, and let them simmer gently until tender.
10136-8{_}6663{_}Now skim off every particle of fat, add the seasoning, and rub the whole through a tammy or sieve; put it back in the saucepan to warm, and when it boils, serve.
10136-8{_}6664{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.
10136-8{_}6665{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March.
10136-8{_}6666{_}_Note_.--Where a very high flavouring is liked, add 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, or a small quantity of port wine.
10136-8{_}6667{_}HISTORY OF THE ONION.--It is not supposed that any variety of     the onion is indigenous to Britain, as when the large and mild     roots imported from warmer climates, have been cultivated in     these islands a few years, they deteriorate both in size and     sweetness.
10136-8{_}6668{_}It is therefore most likely that this plant was first     introduced into England from continental Europe, and that it     originally was produced in a southern climate, and has gradually     become acclimatized to a colder atmosphere.

10136-8{_}6671{_}PICKLED ONIONS (a very Simple Method, and exceedingly Good).
10136-8{_}6672{_}486.
10136-8{_}6673{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pickling onions; to each quart of vinegar, 2 teaspoonfuls of allspice, 2 teaspoonfuls of whole black pepper.
10136-8{_}6674{_}_Mode_.--Have the onions gathered when quite dry and ripe, and, with the fingers, take off the thin outside skin; then, with a silver knife (steel should not be used, as it spoils the colour of the onions), remove one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear.
10136-8{_}6675{_}Have ready some very dry bottles or jars, and as fast as they are peeled, put them in.
10136-8{_}6676{_}Pour over sufficient cold vinegar to cover them, with pepper and allspice in the above proportions, taking care that each jar has its share of the latter ingredients.
10136-8{_}6677{_}Tie down with bladder, and put them in a dry place, and in a fortnight they will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}6678{_}This is a most simple recipe and very delicious, the onions being nice and crisp.
10136-8{_}6679{_}They should be eaten within 6 or 8 months after being done, as the onions are liable to become soft.
10136-8{_}6680{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.
10136-8{_}6681{_}PICKLED ONIONS.
10136-8{_}6682{_}487.
10136-8{_}6683{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 gallon of pickling onions, salt and water, milk; to each 1/2 gallon of vinegar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6684{_}of bruised ginger, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6685{_}of allspice, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6686{_}of whole black pepper, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6687{_}of whole nutmeg bruised, 8 cloves, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6688{_}of mace.
10136-8{_}6689{_}_Mode_.--Gather the onions, which should not be too small, when they are quite dry and ripe; wipe off the dirt, but do not pare them; make a strong solution of salt and water, into which put the onions, and change this, morning and night, for 3 days, and save the _last_ brine they were put in.
10136-8{_}6690{_}Then take the outside skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan capable of holding them all, as they are always better done together.
10136-8{_}6691{_}Now take equal quantities of milk and the last salt and water the onions were in, and pour this to them; to this add 2 large spoonfuls of salt, put them over the fire, and watch them very attentively.
10136-8{_}6692{_}Keep constantly turning the onions about with a wooden skimmer, those at the bottom to the top, and _vice versâ_; and let the milk and water run through the holes of the skimmer.
10136-8{_}6693{_}Remember, the onions must never boil, or, if they do, they will be good for nothing; and they should be quite transparent.
10136-8{_}6694{_}Keep the onions stirred for a few minutes, and, in stirring them, be particular not to break them.
10136-8{_}6695{_}Then have ready a pan with a colander, into which turn the onions to drain, covering them with a cloth to keep in the steam.
10136-8{_}6696{_}Place on a table an old cloth, 2 or 3 times double; put the onions on it when quite hot, and over them an old piece of blanket; cover this closely over them, to keep in the steam.
10136-8{_}6697{_}Let them remain till the next day, when they will be quite cold, and look yellow and shrivelled; take off the shrivelled skins, when they should be as white as snow.
10136-8{_}6698{_}Put them in a pan, make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining ingredients, boil all these up, and pour hot over the onions in the pan.
10136-8{_}6699{_}Cover very closely to keep in all the steam, and let them stand till the following day, when they will be quite cold.
10136-8{_}6700{_}Put them into jars or bottles well bunged, and a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil on the top of each jar or bottle.
10136-8{_}6701{_}Tie them down with bladder, and let them stand in a cool place for a month or six weeks, when they will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}6702{_}They should be beautifully white, and eat crisp, without the least softness, and will keep good many months.
10136-8{_}6703{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.
10136-8{_}6704{_}ORANGE GRAVY, for Wildfowl, Widgeon, Teal, &c.  488.
10136-8{_}6705{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No.
10136-8{_}6706{_}107, 1 small onion, 3 or 4 strips of lemon or orange peel, a few leaves of basil, if at hand, the juice of a Seville orange or lemon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 glass of port wine.
10136-8{_}6707{_}_Mode_.--Put the onion, cut in slices, into a stewpan with the stock, orange-peel, and basil, and let them simmer very gently for 1/4 hour or rather longer, should the gravy not taste sufficiently of the peel.
10136-8{_}6708{_}Strain it off, and add to the gravy the remaining ingredients; let the whole heat through, and, when on the point of boiling, serve very hot in a tureen which should have a cover to it.
10136-8{_}6709{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}6710{_}_Sufficient_ for a small tureen.
10136-8{_}6711{_}OYSTER FORCEMEAT, for Roast or Boiled Turkey.
10136-8{_}6712{_}489.
10136-8{_}6713{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6714{_}of chopped suet or butter, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 1/4 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 2 eggs, 18 oysters.
10136-8{_}6715{_}_Mode_.--Grate the bread very fine, and be careful that no large lumps remain; put it into a basin with the suet, which must be very finely minced, or, when butter is used, that must be cut up into small pieces.
10136-8{_}6716{_}Add the herbs, also chopped as small as possible, and seasoning; mix all these well together, until the ingredients are thoroughly mingled.
10136-8{_}6717{_}Open and beard the oysters, chop them, but not too small, and add them to the other ingredients.

10136-8{_}6719{_}The turkey should not be stuffed too full: if there should be too much forcemeat, roll it into balls, fry them, and use them as a garnish.

10136-8{_}6721{_}OYSTER KETCHUP.
10136-8{_}6722{_}490.
10136-8{_}6723{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient oysters to fill a pint measure, 1 pint of sherry, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}6724{_}of salt, 1 drachm of cayenne, 2 drachms of pounded mace.
10136-8{_}6725{_}_Mode_.--Procure the oysters very fresh, and open sufficient to fill a pint measure; save the liquor, and scald the oysters in it with the sherry; strain the oysters, and put them in a mortar with the salt, cayenne, and mace; pound the whole until reduced to a pulp, then add it to the liquor in which they were scalded; boil it again five minutes, and skim well; rub the whole through a sieve, and, when cold, bottle and cork closely.
10136-8{_}6726{_}The corks should be sealed.
10136-8{_}6727{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}6728{_}_Note_.--Cider may be substituted for the sherry.
10136-8{_}6729{_}PICKLED OYSTERS.
10136-8{_}6730{_}491.
10136-8{_}6731{_}INGREDIENTS.--100 oysters; to each 1/2 pint of vinegar, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 12 black peppercorns.
10136-8{_}6732{_}_Mode_.--Get the oysters in good condition, open them, place them in a saucepan, and let them simmer in their own liquor for about 10 minutes, very gently; then take them out, one by one, and place them in a jar, and cover them, when cold, with a pickle made as follows:--Measure the oyster-liquor; add to it the same quantity of vinegar, with mace, lemon-peel, and pepper in the above proportion, and boil it for 5 minutes; when cold, pour over the oysters, and tie them down very closely, as contact with the air spoils them.
10136-8{_}6733{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}6734{_}_Note_.--Put this pickle away in small jars; because directly one is opened, its contents should immediately be eaten, as they soon spoil.
10136-8{_}6735{_}The pickle should not be kept more than 2 or 3 months.
10136-8{_}6736{_}OYSTER SAUCE, to serve with Fish, Boiled Poultry, &c.  492.
10136-8{_}6737{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, 1/2 pint of melted butter, made with milk, No.
10136-8{_}6738{_}380.
10136-8{_}6739{_}_Mode_.--Open the oysters carefully, and save their liquor; strain it into a clean saucepan (a lined one is best), put in the oysters, and let them just come to the boiling-point, when they should look plump.
10136-8{_}6740{_}Take them off the fire immediately, and put the whole into a basin.
10136-8{_}6741{_}Strain the liquor from them, mix with it sufficient milk to make 1/2 pint altogether, and follow the directions of No.
10136-8{_}6742{_}380.
10136-8{_}6743{_}When the melted butter is ready and very smooth, put in the oysters, which should be previously bearded, if you wish the sauce to be really nice.
10136-8{_}6744{_}Set it by the side of the fire to get thoroughly hot, _but do not allow it to boil_, or the oysters will immediately harden.
10136-8{_}6745{_}Using cream instead of milk makes this sauce extremely delicious.
10136-8{_}6746{_}When liked, add a seasoning of cayenne, or anchovy sauce; but, as we have before stated, a plain sauce _should_ be plain, and not be overpowered by highly-flavoured essences; therefore we recommend that the above directions be implicitly followed, and no seasoning added.
10136-8{_}6747{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.
10136-8{_}6748{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}6749{_}Never allow fewer than 6 oysters to 1 person, unless the party is very large.
10136-8{_}6750{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}6751{_}A more economical sauce may be made by using a smaller quantity of oysters, and not bearding them before they are added to the sauce: this may answer the purpose, but we cannot undertake to recommend it as a mode of making this delicious adjunct to fish, &c.   PARSLEY AND BUTTER, to serve with Calf's Head.
10136-8{_}6752{_}Boiled Fowls, &c.  493.
10136-8{_}6753{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 1/2 pint of melted butter, No.
10136-8{_}6754{_}376.
10136-8{_}6755{_}_Mode_.--Put into a saucepan a small quantity of water, slightly salted, and when it boils, throw in a good bunch of parsley which has been previously washed and tied together in a bunch; let it boil for 5 minutes, drain it, mince the leaves very fine, and put the above quantity in a tureen; pour over it 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter; stir once, that the ingredients may be thoroughly mixed, and serve.
10136-8{_}6756{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the parsley.
10136-8{_}6757{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}6758{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 large fowl; allow rather more for a pair.
10136-8{_}6759{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}6760{_}_Note_.--Sometimes, in the middle of winter, parsley-leaves are not to be had, when the following will be found an excellent substitute:--Tie up a little parsley-seed in a small piece of muslin, and boil it for 10 minutes in a small quantity of water; use this water to make the melted butter with, and throw into it a little boiled spinach, minced rather fine, which will have an appearance similar to that of parsley.
10136-8{_}6761{_}[Illustration: PARSLEY.]
10136-8{_}6762{_}PARSLEY.--If there be nothing new under the sun, there are, at     any rate, different uses found for the same thing; for this     pretty aromatic herb was used in ancient times, as we learn from     mythological narrative, to adorn the head of a hero, no less     than Hercules; and now--was ever fall so great?--we moderns use     it in connection with the head of--a calf.
10136-8{_}6763{_}According to Homer's     "Iliad," warriors fed their chariot-steeds on parsley; and Pliny     acquaints us with the fact that, as a symbol of mourning, it was     admitted to furnish the funeral tables of the Romans.
10136-8{_}6764{_}Egypt,     some say, first produced this herb; thence it was introduced, by     some unknown voyager, into Sardinia, where the Carthaginians     found it, and made it known to the inhabitants of Marseilles.

10136-8{_}6767{_}FRIED PARSLEY, for Garnishing.
10136-8{_}6768{_}494.
10136-8{_}6769{_}INGREDIENTS.--Parsley, hot lard or clarified dripping.
10136-8{_}6770{_}_Mode_.--Gather some young parsley; wash, pick, and dry it thoroughly in a cloth; put it into the wire basket of which we have given an engraving, and hold it in boiling lard or dripping for a minute or two.
10136-8{_}6771{_}Directly it is done, lift out the basket, and let it stand before the fire, that the parsley may become thoroughly crisp; and the quicker it is fried the better.
10136-8{_}6772{_}Should the kitchen not be furnished with the above article, throw the parsley into the frying-pan, and when crisp, lift it out with a slice, dry it before the fire, and when thoroughly crisp, it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6773{_}[Illustration: WIRE BASKET.]
10136-8{_}6774{_}WIRE BASKET.--For this recipe, a wire basket, as shown in the     annexed engraving, will be found very useful.
10136-8{_}6775{_}It is very light     and handy, and may be used for other similar purposes besides     that described above.
10136-8{_}6776{_}PARSLEY JUICE, for Colouring various Dishes.
10136-8{_}6777{_}495.
10136-8{_}6778{_}Procure some nice young parsley; wash it and dry it thoroughly in a cloth; pound the leaves in a mortar till all the juice is extracted, and put the juice in a teacup or small jar; place this in a saucepan of boiling water, and warm it on the _bain marie_ principle just long enough to take off its rawness; let it drain, and it will be ready for colouring.
10136-8{_}6779{_}TO PRESERVE PARSLEY THROUGH THE WINTER.
10136-8{_}6780{_}496.
10136-8{_}6781{_}Use freshly-gathered parsley for keeping, and wash it perfectly free from grit and dirt; put it into boiling water which has been slightly salted and well skimmed, and then let it boil for 2 or 3 minutes; take it out, let it drain, and lay it on a sieve in front of the fire, when it should be dried as expeditiously as possible.
10136-8{_}6782{_}Store it away in a very dry place in bottles, and when wanted for use, pour over it a little warm water, and let it stand for about 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}6783{_}_Seasonable_.--This may be done at any time between June and October.
10136-8{_}6784{_}AN EXCELLENT PICKLE.
10136-8{_}6785{_}497.
10136-8{_}6786{_}INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of medium-sized onions, cucumbers, and sauce-apples; 1-1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 3/4 teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 wineglassful of soy, 1 wineglassful of sherry; vinegar.
10136-8{_}6787{_}_Mode_.--Slice sufficient cucumbers, onions, and apples to fill a pint stone jar, taking care to cut the slices very thin; arrange them in alternate layers, shaking in as you proceed salt and cayenne in the above proportion; pour in the soy and wine, and fill up with vinegar.
10136-8{_}6788{_}It will be fit for use the day it is made.
10136-8{_}6789{_}_Seasonable_ in August and September.
10136-8{_}6790{_}[This recipe was forwarded to the editress of this work by a subscriber to the "Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine."
10136-8{_}6791{_}Mrs. Beeton, not having tested it, cannot vouch for its excellence; but the contributor spoke very highly in its favour.]
10136-8{_}6792{_}SOY.--This is a sauce frequently made use of for fish, and comes     from Japan, where it is prepared from the seeds of a plant     called _Dolichos Soja_.
10136-8{_}6793{_}The Chinese also manufacture it; but     that made by the Japanese is said to be the best.
10136-8{_}6794{_}All sorts of     statements have been made respecting the very general     adulteration of this article in England, and we fear that many     of them are too true.
10136-8{_}6795{_}When genuine, it is of an agreeable     flavour, thick, and of a clear brown colour.
10136-8{_}6796{_}PICKLED RED CABBAGE.
10136-8{_}6797{_}498.
10136-8{_}6798{_}INGREDIENTS.--Red cabbages, salt and water; to each quart of vinegar, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6799{_}of ginger well bruised, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6800{_}of whole black pepper, and, when liked, a little cayenne.
10136-8{_}6801{_}_Mode_.--Take off the outside decayed leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut it in quarters, remove the stalks, and cut it across in very thin slices.
10136-8{_}6802{_}Lay these on a dish, and strew them plentifully with salt, covering them with another dish.
10136-8{_}6803{_}Let them remain for 24 hours, turn into a colander to drain, and, if necessary, wipe lightly with a clean soft cloth.
10136-8{_}6804{_}Put them in a jar; boil up the vinegar with spices in the above proportion, and, when cold, pour it over the cabbage.
10136-8{_}6805{_}It will be fit for use in a week or two, and, if kept for a very long time, the cabbage is liable get soft and to discolour.
10136-8{_}6806{_}To be really nice and crisp, and of a good red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately after it is made.
10136-8{_}6807{_}A little bruised cochineal boiled with the vinegar adds much to the appearance of this pickle.
10136-8{_}6808{_}Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place.
10136-8{_}6809{_}_Seasonable_ in July and August, but the pickle will be much more crisp if the frost has just touched the leaves.
10136-8{_}6810{_}RED CABBAGE.--This plant, in its growth, is similar in form to     that of the white, but is of a bluish-purple colour, which,     however, turns red on the application of acid, as is the case     with all vegetable blues.
10136-8{_}6811{_}It is principally from the white     vegetable that the Germans make their _sauer kraut_; a dish held     in such high estimation with the inhabitants of Vaderland, but     which requires, generally speaking, with strangers, a long     acquaintance in order to become sufficiently impressed with its     numerous merits.
10136-8{_}6812{_}The large red Dutch is the kind generally     recommended for pickling.
10136-8{_}6813{_}PLUM-PUDDING SAUCE.
10136-8{_}6814{_}499.
10136-8{_}6815{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 wineglassful of brandy, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}6816{_}of very fresh butter, 1 glass of Madeira, pounded sugar to taste.
10136-8{_}6817{_}_Mode_.--Put the pounded sugar in a basin, with part of the brandy and the butter; let it stand by the side of the fire until it is warm and the sugar and butter are dissolved; then add the rest of the brandy, with the Madeira.
10136-8{_}6818{_}Either pour it over the pudding, or serve in a tureen.
10136-8{_}6819{_}This is a very rich and excellent sauce.
10136-8{_}6820{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}6821{_}3d.
10136-8{_}6822{_}for this quantity.
10136-8{_}6823{_}_Sufficient_ for a pudding made for 6 persons.

10136-8{_}6825{_}500.
10136-8{_}6826{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of walnut pickle, 1/2 pint of port wine, 1 pint of mushroom ketchup, 1 dozen anchovies, 1 dozen shalots, 1/4 pint of soy, 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne.
10136-8{_}6827{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, having previously chopped the shalots and anchovies very small; simmer for 15 minutes, strain, and, when cold, bottle off for use: the corks should be well sealed to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}6828{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}6829{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}6833{_}501.
10136-8{_}6834{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 teaspoonful of cavice, 1 teaspoonful of Chili vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of Reading sauce, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 3 tablespoonfuls of thick Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}6835{_}367, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream; salt and pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}6836{_}_Mode_.--Scald the parsley, mince the leaves very fine, and add it to all the other ingredients; after mixing the whole together thoroughly, the sauce will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6837{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 10d.
10136-8{_}6838{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}6839{_}READING SAUCE.
10136-8{_}6840{_}502.
10136-8{_}6841{_}INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 pints of walnut pickle, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6842{_}of shalots, 1 quart of spring water, 3/4 pint of Indian soy, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6843{_}of bruised ginger, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6844{_}of long pepper, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}6845{_}of mustard-seed, 1 anchovy, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6846{_}of cayenne, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}6847{_}of dried sweet bay-leaves.
10136-8{_}6848{_}_Mode_.--Bruise the shalots in a mortar, and put them in a stone jar with the walnut-liquor; place it before the fire, and let it boil until reduced to 2 pints.
10136-8{_}6849{_}Then, into another jar, put all the ingredients except the bay-leaves, taking care that they are well bruised, so that the flavour may be thoroughly extracted; put this also before the fire, and let it boil for 1 hour, or rather more.
10136-8{_}6850{_}When the contents of both jars are sufficiently cooked, mix them together, stirring them well as you mix them, and submit them to a slow boiling for 1/2 hour; cover closely, and let them stand 24 hours in a cool place; then open the jar and add the bay-leaves; let it stand a week longer closed down, when strain through a flannel bag, and it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6851{_}The above quantities will make 1/2 gallon.
10136-8{_}6852{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 3 hours.

10136-8{_}6854{_}REMOULADE, or FRENCH SALAD-DRESSING.
10136-8{_}6855{_}503.
10136-8{_}6856{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 tablespoonful of made mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, 3 tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, 1 tablespoonful of tarragon or plain vinegar.
10136-8{_}6857{_}_Mode_.--Boil 3 eggs quite hard for about 1/4 hour, put them into cold water, and let them remain in it for a few minutes; strip off the shells, put the yolks in a mortar, and pound them very smoothly; add to them, very gradually, the mustard, seasoning, and vinegar, keeping all well stirred and rubbed down with the back of a wooden spoon.
10136-8{_}6858{_}Put in the oil drop by drop, and when this is thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, add the yolk of a raw egg, and stir well, when it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6859{_}This sauce should not be curdled; and to prevent this, the only way is to mix a little of everything at a time, and not to cease stirring.
10136-8{_}6860{_}The quantities of oil and vinegar may be increased or diminished according to taste, as many persons would prefer a smaller proportion of the former ingredient.
10136-8{_}6861{_}GREEN REMOULADE is made by using tarragon vinegar instead of plain, and colouring with a little parsley-juice, No.
10136-8{_}6862{_}495.
10136-8{_}6863{_}Harvey's sauce, or Chili vinegar, may be added at pleasure.
10136-8{_}6864{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the eggs.
10136-8{_}6865{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.
10136-8{_}6866{_}_Sufficient_ for a salad made for 4 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}6867{_}[Illustration: TARRAGON.]
10136-8{_}6868{_}TARRAGON.--The leaves of this plant, known to naturalists as     _Artemisia dracunculus_, are much used in France as a flavouring     ingredient for salads.
10136-8{_}6869{_}From it also is made the vinegar known as     tarragon vinegar, which is employed by the French in mixing     their mustard.
10136-8{_}6870{_}It originally comes from Tartary, and does not     seed in France.
10136-8{_}6871{_}SAGE-AND-ONION STUFFING, for Geese, Ducks, and Pork.
10136-8{_}6872{_}504.
10136-8{_}6873{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}6874{_}of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}6875{_}of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.
10136-8{_}6876{_}_Mode_.--Peel the onions, put them into boiling water, let them simmer for 5 minutes or rather longer, and, just before they are taken out, put in the sage-leaves for a minute or two to take off their rawness.
10136-8{_}6877{_}Chop both these very fine, add the bread, seasoning, and butter, and work the whole together with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6878{_}It should be rather highly seasoned, and the sage-leaves should be very finely chopped.
10136-8{_}6879{_}Many cooks do not parboil the onions in the manner just stated, but merely use them raw.
10136-8{_}6880{_}The stuffing then, however, is not nearly so mild, and, to many tastes, its strong flavour would be very objectionable.
10136-8{_}6881{_}When made for goose, a portion of the liver of the bird, simmered for a few minutes and very finely minced, is frequently added to this stuffing; and where economy is studied, the egg may be dispensed with.
10136-8{_}6882{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 5 minutes to simmer the onions.
10136-8{_}6883{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 4d.
10136-8{_}6884{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 goose, or a pair of ducks.
10136-8{_}6885{_}505.
10136-8{_}6886{_}SOYER'S RECIPE FOR GOOSE STUFFING.--Take 4 apples, peeled and cored, 4 onions, 4 leaves of sage, and 4 leaves of lemon thyme not broken, and boil them in a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them; when done, pulp them through a sieve, removing the sage and thyme; then add sufficient pulp of mealy potatoes to cause it to be sufficiently dry without sticking to the hand; add pepper and salt, and stuff the bird.
10136-8{_}6887{_}SALAD DRESSING (Excellent).
10136-8{_}6888{_}I.
10136-8{_}6889{_}506.
10136-8{_}6890{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}6891{_}_Mode_.--Put the mixed mustard into a salad-bowl with the sugar, and add the oil drop by drop, carefully stirring and mixing all these ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}6892{_}Proceed in this manner with the milk and vinegar, which must be added very _gradually_, or the sauce will curdle.
10136-8{_}6893{_}Put in the seasoning, when the mixture will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}6894{_}If this dressing is properly made, it will have a soft creamy appearance, and will be found very delicious with crab, or cold fried fish (the latter cut into dice), as well as with salads.
10136-8{_}6895{_}In mixing salad dressings, the ingredients cannot be added _too gradually_, or _stirred too much_.
10136-8{_}6896{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 3d.
10136-8{_}6897{_}_Sufficient_ for a small salad.
10136-8{_}6898{_}This recipe can be confidently recommended by the editress, to whom it was given by an intimate friend noted for her salads.
10136-8{_}6899{_}SCARCITY OF SALADS IN ENGLAND.--Three centuries ago, very few     vegetables were cultivated in England, and an author writing of     the period of Henry VIII.
10136-8{_}6900{_}'s reign, tells us that neither salad,     nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any other     comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of the     kingdom: they came from Holland and Flanders.
10136-8{_}6901{_}We further learn,     that Queen Catharine herself, with all her royalty, could not     procure a salad of English growth for her dinner.
10136-8{_}6902{_}The king was     obliged to mend this sad state of affairs, and send to Holland     for a gardener in order to cultivate those pot-herbs, in the     growth of which England is now, perhaps, not behind any other     country in Europe.

10136-8{_}6906{_}Among the Greeks, the prize of the victor in the Olympic games     was a wreath of wild olive; and the "Mount of Olives" is     rendered familiar to our ears by its being mentioned in the     Scriptures as near to Jerusalem.
10136-8{_}6907{_}The tree is indigenous in the     north of Africa, Syria, and Greece; and the Romans introduced it     to Italy.
10136-8{_}6908{_}In Spain and the south of France it is now cultivated;     and although it grows in England, its fruit does not ripen in     the open air.
10136-8{_}6909{_}Both in Greece and Portugal the fruit is eaten in     its ripe state; but its taste is not agreeable to many palates.
10136-8{_}6910{_}To the Italian shepherd, bread and olives, with a little wine,     form a nourishing diet; but in England, olives are usually only     introduced by way of dessert, to destroy the taste of the viands     which have been previously eaten, that the flavour of the wine     may be the better enjoyed.
10136-8{_}6911{_}There are three kinds of olives     imported to London,--the French, Spanish, and Italian: the first     are from Provence, and are generally accounted excellent; the     second are larger, but more bitter; and the last are from Lucca,     and are esteemed the best.
10136-8{_}6912{_}The oil extracted from olives, called     olive oil, or salad oil, is, with the continentals, in continual     request, more dishes being prepared with than without it, we     should imagine.
10136-8{_}6913{_}With us, it is principally used in mixing a     salad, and when thus employed, it tends to prevent fermentation,     and is an antidote against flatulency.

10136-8{_}6915{_}507.
10136-8{_}6916{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1/4 teaspoonful of white pepper, half that quantity of cayenne, salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, vinegar.
10136-8{_}6917{_}_Mode_.--Boil the eggs until hard, which will be in about 1/4 hour or 20 minutes; put them into cold water, take off the shells, and pound the yolks in a mortar to a smooth paste.
10136-8{_}6918{_}Then add all the other ingredients, except the vinegar, and stir them well until the whole are thoroughly incorporated one with the other.
10136-8{_}6919{_}Pour in sufficient vinegar to make it of the consistency of cream, taking care to add but little at a time.

10136-8{_}6926{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of salad oil, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream.
10136-8{_}6927{_}_Mode_.--Prepare and mix the ingredients by the preceding recipe, and be very particular that the whole is well stirred.
10136-8{_}6928{_}_Note_.--In making salads, the vegetables, &c., should never be added to the sauce very long before they are wanted for table; the dressing, however, may always be prepared some hours before required.
10136-8{_}6929{_}Where salads are much in request, it is a good plan to bottle off sufficient dressing for a few days' consumption, as, thereby, much time and trouble are saved.

10136-8{_}6931{_}POETIC RECIPE FOR SALAD.--The Rev.
10136-8{_}6932{_}Sydney Smith, the witty canon     of St. Paul's, who thought that an enjoyment of the good things     of this earth was compatible with aspirations for things higher,     wrote the following excellent recipe for salad, which we should     advise our readers not to pass by without a trial, when the hot     weather invites to a dish of cold lamb.
10136-8{_}6933{_}May they find the     flavour equal to the rhyme.--        "Two large potatoes, pass'd through kitchen sieve,       Smoothness and softness to the salad give:       Of mordent mustard add a single spoon,       Distrust the condiment that bites too soon;       But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault.
10136-8{_}6934{_}To add a double quantity of salt:       Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown,       And twice with vinegar procured from 'town;       True flavour needs it, and your poet begs,       The pounded yellow of two well-boil'd eggs.
10136-8{_}6935{_}Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl,       And, scarce suspected, animate the whole;       And, lastly, in the flavour'd compound toss       A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce.

10136-8{_}6963{_}MANUFACTURE OF SAUCES.--In France, during the reign of Louis     XII., at the latter end of the 14th century, there was formed a     company of sauce-manufacturers, who obtained, in those days of     monopolies, the exclusive privilege of making sauces.
10136-8{_}6964{_}The     statutes drawn up by this company inform us that the famous     sauce à la cameline, sold by them, was to be composed or "good     cinnamon, good ginger, good cloves, good grains of paradise,     good bread, and good vinegar."
10136-8{_}6965{_}The sauce Tence, was to be made     of "good sound almonds, good ginger, good wine, and good     verjuice."
10136-8{_}6966{_}May we respectfully express a hope--not that we     desire to doubt it in the least--that the English     sauce-manufacturers of the 19th century are equally considerate     and careful in choosing their ingredients for their various     well-known preparations.

10136-8{_}6980{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Espagnole (No.

10136-8{_}6993{_}[Illustration: THE BAY.]
10136-8{_}6994{_}THE BAY.--We have already described (see No.
10136-8{_}6995{_}180) the difference     between the cherry-laurel (_Prunus Laurus cerasus_) and the     classic laurel (_Laurus nobilis_), the former only being used     for culinary purposes.
10136-8{_}6996{_}The latter beautiful evergreen was     consecrated by the ancients to priests and heroes, and used in     their sacrifices.
10136-8{_}6997{_}"A crown of bay" was the earnestly-desired     reward for great enterprises, and for the display of uncommon     genius in oratory or writing.
10136-8{_}6998{_}It was more particularly sacred to     Apollo, because, according to the fable, the nymph Daphne was     changed into a laurel-tree.
10136-8{_}6999{_}The ancients believed, too, that the     laurel had the power of communicating the gift of prophecy, as     well as poetic genius; and, when they wished to procure pleasant     dreams, would place a sprig under the pillow of their bed.
10136-8{_}7000{_}It     was the symbol, too, of victory, and it was thought that the     laurel could never be struck by lightning.
10136-8{_}7001{_}From this word comes     that of "laureate;" Alfred Tennyson being the present poet     laureate, crowned with laurel as the first of living bards.

10136-8{_}7051{_}THE GROWTH OF THE PEPPER-PLANT.--Our readers will see at Nos.
10136-8{_}7052{_}369 and 399, a description, with engravings, of the qualities of     black and long pepper, and an account of where these spices are     found.
10136-8{_}7053{_}We will here say something of the manner of the growth of     the pepper-plant.
10136-8{_}7054{_}Like the vine, it requires support, and it is     usual to plant a thorny tree by its side, to which it may cling.
10136-8{_}7055{_}In Malabar, the chief pepper district of India, the jacca-tree     (_Artocarpus integrifolia_) is made thus to yield its     assistance, the same soil being adapted to the growth of both     plants.
10136-8{_}7056{_}The stem of the pepper-plant entwines round its support     to a considerable height; the flexile branches then droop     downwards, bearing at their extremities, as well as at other     parts, spikes of green flowers, which are followed by the     pungent berries.
10136-8{_}7057{_}These hang in large bunches, resembling in     shape those of grapes; but the fruit grows distinct, each on a     little stalk, like currants.
10136-8{_}7058{_}Each berry contains a single seed,     of a globular form and brownish colour, but which changes to a     nearly black when dried; and this is the pepper of commerce.
10136-8{_}7059{_}The     leaves are not unlike those of the ivy, but are larger and of     rather lighter colour; they partake strongly of the peculiar     smell and pungent taste of the berry.

10136-8{_}7101{_}of knuckle of veal, poultry trimmings (if for game pies, any game trimmings), 2 onions stuck with cloves, 2 carrots, 4 shalots, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 bay-leaves; when liked, 2 blades of mace and a little spice; 2 slices of lean ham, rather more than 2 quarts of water.
10136-8{_}7102{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the meat and put it into a stewpan with all the ingredients except the water; set it over a slow fire to draw down, and, when the gravy ceases to flow from the meat, pour in the water.
10136-8{_}7103{_}Let it boil up, then carefully take away all scum from the top.
10136-8{_}7104{_}Cover the stewpan closely, and let the stock simmer very gently for 4 hours: if rapidly boiled, the jelly will not be clear.
10136-8{_}7105{_}When done, strain it through a fine sieve or flannel bag; and when cold, the jelly should be quite transparent.
10136-8{_}7106{_}If this is not the case, clarify it with the whites of eggs, as described in recipe No.
10136-8{_}7107{_}109.
10136-8{_}7108{_}_Time_.--4 hours.
10136-8{_}7109{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 5s.
10136-8{_}7110{_}SHRIMP SAUCE, for Various Kinds of Fish.
10136-8{_}7111{_}522.
10136-8{_}7112{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/3 pint of melted butter (No.
10136-8{_}7113{_}376), 1/4 pint of picked shrimps, cayenne to taste.
10136-8{_}7114{_}_Mode_.--Make the melted butter very smoothly by recipe No.
10136-8{_}7115{_}376, shell the shrimps (sufficient to make 1/4 pint when picked), and put them into the butter; season with cayenne, and let the sauce just simmer, but do not allow it to boil.
10136-8{_}7116{_}When liked, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce may be added.
10136-8{_}7117{_}_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.
10136-8{_}7118{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}7119{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}7120{_}SPINACH GREEN FOR COLOURING VARIOUS DISHES.
10136-8{_}7121{_}523.
10136-8{_}7122{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 handfuls of spinach.
10136-8{_}7123{_}_Mode_.--Pick and wash the spinach free from dirt, and pound the leaves in a mortar to extract the juice; then press it through a hair sieve, and put the juice into a small stewpan or jar.
10136-8{_}7124{_}Place this in a bain marie, or saucepan of boiling water, and let it set.
10136-8{_}7125{_}Watch it closely, as it should not boil; and, as soon as it is done, lay it in a sieve, so that all the water may drain from it, and the green will then be ready for colouring.
10136-8{_}7126{_}If made according to this recipe, the spinach-green will be found far superior to that boiled in the ordinary way.
10136-8{_}7127{_}HOT SPICE, a Delicious Adjunct to Chops, Steaks, Gravies, &c.  524.
10136-8{_}7128{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 drachms each of ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon, 7 cloves, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}7129{_}mace, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}7130{_}of cayenne, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}7131{_}grated nutmeg, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}7132{_}white pepper.
10136-8{_}7133{_}_Mode_.--Pound the ingredients, and mix them thoroughly together, taking care that everything is well blended.
10136-8{_}7134{_}Put the spice in a very dry glass bottle for use.
10136-8{_}7135{_}The quantity of cayenne may be increased, should the above not be enough to suit the palate.
10136-8{_}7136{_}[Illustration: CINNAMON.]
10136-8{_}7137{_}CINNAMON.--The cinnamon-tree (_Laurus Cinnamomum_) is a valuable     and beautiful species of the laurel family, and grows to the     height of 20 or 30 feet.
10136-8{_}7138{_}The trunk is short and straight, with     wide-spreading branches, and it has a smooth ash-like bark.
10136-8{_}7139{_}The     leaves are upon short stalks, and are of an oval shape, and 3 to     5 inches long.
10136-8{_}7140{_}The flowers are in panicles, with six small     petals, and the fruit is about the size of an olive, soft,     insipid, and of a deep blue.
10136-8{_}7141{_}This incloses a nut, the kernel of     which germinates soon after it falls.
10136-8{_}7142{_}The wood of the tree is     white and not very solid, and its root is thick and branching,     exuding a great quantity of camphor.
10136-8{_}7143{_}The inner bark of the tree     forms the cinnamon of commerce.
10136-8{_}7144{_}Ceylon was thought to be its     native island; but it has been found in Malabar, Cochin-China,     Sumatra, and the Eastern Islands; also in the Brazils, the     Mauritius, Jamaica, and other tropical localities.
10136-8{_}7145{_}BROWN ROUX, a French Thickening for Gravies and Sauces.
10136-8{_}7146{_}525.
10136-8{_}7147{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 oz.
10136-8{_}7148{_}of butter, 9 oz.
10136-8{_}7149{_}of flour.
10136-8{_}7150{_}_Mode_.--Melt the butter in a stewpan over a slow fire, and dredge in, very gradually, the flour; stir it till of a light-brown colour--to obtain this do it very slowly, otherwise the flour will burn and impart a bitter taste to the sauce it is mixed with.
10136-8{_}7151{_}Pour it in a jar, and keep it for use: it will remain good some time.
10136-8{_}7152{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7153{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}7154{_}WHITE ROUX, for thickening White Sauces.
10136-8{_}7155{_}526.
10136-8{_}7156{_}Allow the same proportions of butter and flour as in the preceding recipe, and proceed in the same manner as for brown roux, but do not keep it on the fire too long, and take care not to let it colour.
10136-8{_}7157{_}This is used for thickening white sauce.
10136-8{_}7158{_}Pour it into a jar to use when wanted.
10136-8{_}7159{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}7160{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}7161{_}_Sufficient_,--A dessertspoonful will thicken a pint of gravy.
10136-8{_}7162{_}_Note_.--Besides the above, sauces may be thickened with potato flour, ground rice, baked flour, arrowroot, &c.: the latter will be found far preferable to the ordinary flour for white sauces.
10136-8{_}7163{_}A slice of bread, toasted and added to gravies, answers the two purposes of thickening and colouring them.
10136-8{_}7164{_}SPANISH ONIONS--PICKLED.
10136-8{_}7165{_}527.
10136-8{_}7166{_}INGREDIENTS.--Onions, vinegar; salt and cayenne to taste.
10136-8{_}7167{_}_Mode_.--Cut the onions in thin slices; put a layer of them in the bottom of a jar; sprinkle with salt and cayenne; then add another layer of onions, and season as before.
10136-8{_}7168{_}Proceeding in this manner till the jar is full, pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and the pickle will be fit for use in a month.
10136-8{_}7169{_}_Seasonable_.--May be had in England from September to February.
10136-8{_}7170{_}STORE SAUCE, or CHEROKEE.
10136-8{_}7171{_}528.
10136-8{_}7172{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}7173{_}of cayenne pepper, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy, 1 tablespoonful of walnut ketchup, 1 pint of vinegar.
10136-8{_}7174{_}_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients _gently_ for about 1/2 hour; strain the liquor, and bottle off for use.
10136-8{_}7175{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7176{_}_Seasonable_.--This sauce can be made at any time.
10136-8{_}7177{_}TOMATO SAUCE--HOT, to serve with Cutlets, Roast Meats, &c.  529.
10136-8{_}7178{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 tomatoes, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 1 blade of mace, salt and cayenne to taste, 1/4 pint of gravy, No.

10136-8{_}7180{_}104.
10136-8{_}7181{_}_Mode_.--Cut the tomatoes in two, and squeeze the juice and seeds out; put them in a stewpan with all the ingredients, and let them simmer _gently_ until the tomatoes are tender enough to pulp; rub the whole through a sieve, boil it for a few minutes, and serve.
10136-8{_}7182{_}The shalots and spices may be omitted when their flavour is objected to.
10136-8{_}7183{_}_Time_.--1 hour, or rather more, to simmer the tomatoes.
10136-8{_}7184{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.
10136-8{_}7185{_}_In full season_ in September and October.
10136-8{_}7186{_}[Illustration: THE TOMATO.]
10136-8{_}7187{_}TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--The plant which bears this fruit is a     native of South America, and takes its name from a Portuguese     word.
10136-8{_}7188{_}The tomato fruit is about the size of a small potato, and     is chiefly used in soups, sauces, and gravies.
10136-8{_}7189{_}It is sometimes     served to table roasted or boiled, and when green, makes a good     ketchup or pickle.
10136-8{_}7190{_}In its unripe state, it is esteemed as     excellent sauce for roast goose or pork, and when quite ripe, a     good store sauce may be prepared from it.
10136-8{_}7191{_}TOMATO SAUCE FOR KEEPING (Excellent).
10136-8{_}7192{_}I.
10136-8{_}7193{_}530.
10136-8{_}7194{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of cayenne vinegar (No.
10136-8{_}7195{_}386), 3/4 oz.
10136-8{_}7196{_}of shalots, 3/4 oz.
10136-8{_}7197{_}of garlic, peeled and cut in slices; salt to taste.
10136-8{_}7198{_}To every six quarts of liquor, 1 pint of soy, 1 pint of anchovy sauce.
10136-8{_}7199{_}_Mode_.--Gather the tomatoes quite ripe; bake them in a slow oven till tender; rub them through a sieve, and to every quart of pulp add cayenne vinegar, shalots, garlic, and salt, in the above proportion; boil the whole together till the garlic and shalots are quite soft; then rub it through a sieve, put it again into a saucepan, and, to every six quarts of the liquor, add 1 pint of soy and the same quantity of anchovy sauce, and boil altogether for about 20 minutes; bottle off for use, and carefully seal or rosin the corks.
10136-8{_}7200{_}This will keep good for 2 or 3 years, but will be fit for use in a week.
10136-8{_}7201{_}A useful and less expensive sauce may be made by omitting the anchovy and soy.
10136-8{_}7202{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.
10136-8{_}7203{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this from the middle of September to the end of October.
10136-8{_}7204{_}II.
10136-8{_}7205{_}531.
10136-8{_}7206{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 dozen tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls of the best powdered ginger, 1 dessertspoonful of salt, 1 head of garlic chopped fine, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar (a small quantity of cayenne may be substituted for this).
10136-8{_}7207{_}_Mode_.--Choose ripe tomatoes, put them into a stone jar, and stand them in a cool oven until quite tender; when cold, take the skins and stalks from them, mix the pulp with the liquor which is in the jar, but do not strain it; add all the other ingredients, mix well together, and put it into well-sealed bottles.
10136-8{_}7208{_}Stored away in a cool dry place, it will keep good for years.
10136-8{_}7209{_}It is ready for use as soon as made, but the flavour is better after a week or two.
10136-8{_}7210{_}Should it not appear to keep, turn it out, and boil it up with a little additional ginger and cayenne.
10136-8{_}7211{_}For immediate use, the skins should be put into a wide-mouthed bottle with a little of the different ingredients, and they will be found very nice for hashes or stews.
10136-8{_}7212{_}_Time_.--4 or 5 hours in a cool oven.
10136-8{_}7213{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of September to the end of October.
10136-8{_}7214{_}III.
10136-8{_}7215{_}532.
10136-8{_}7216{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen tomatoes; to every pound of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of Chili vinegar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}7217{_}of garlic, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}7218{_}of shalot, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}7219{_}of salt, 1 large green capsicum, 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne, 2 pickled gherkins, 6 pickled onions, 1 pint of common vinegar, and the juice of 6 lemons.
10136-8{_}7220{_}_Mode_.--Choose the tomatoes when quite ripe and red; put them in a jar with a cover to it, and bake them till tender.
10136-8{_}7221{_}The better way is to put them in the oven overnight, when it will not be too hot, and examine them in the morning to see if they are tender.
10136-8{_}7222{_}Do not allow them to remain in the oven long enough to break them; but they should be sufficiently soft to skin nicely and rub through the sieve.
10136-8{_}7223{_}Measure the pulp, and to each pound of pulp, add the above proportion of vinegar and other ingredients, taking care to chop very fine the garlic, shalot, capsicum, onion, and gherkins.
10136-8{_}7224{_}Boil the whole together till everything is tender; then again rub it through a sieve, and add the lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}7225{_}Now boil the whole again till it becomes as thick as cream, and keep continually stirring; bottle it when quite cold, cork well, and seal the corks.
10136-8{_}7226{_}If the flavour of garlic and shalot is very much disliked, diminish the quantities.
10136-8{_}7227{_}_Time_.--Bake the tomatoes in a cool oven all night.
10136-8{_}7228{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of September to the end of October.
10136-8{_}7229{_}_Note_.--A quantity of liquor will flow from the tomatoes, which must be put through the sieve with the rest.
10136-8{_}7230{_}Keep it well stirred while on the fire, and use a wooden spoon.
10136-8{_}7231{_}UNIVERSAL PICKLE.

10136-8{_}7239{_}of turmeric.
10136-8{_}7240{_}_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients together for about 20 minutes; when cold, put them into a jar with whatever vegetables you choose, such as radish-pods, French beans, cauliflowers, gherkins, &c. &c., as these come into season; put them in fresh as you gather them, having previously wiped them perfectly free from moisture and grit.
10136-8{_}7241{_}This pickle will be fit for use in about 8 or 9 months.
10136-8{_}7242{_}_Time_.--20 minutes.
10136-8{_}7243{_}_Seasonable_.--Make the pickle in May or June, to be ready for the various vegetables.
10136-8{_}7244{_}_Note_.--As this pickle takes 2 or 3 months to make,--that is to say, nearly that time will elapse before all the different vegetables are added,--care must be taken to keep the jar which contains the pickle well covered, either with a closely-fitting lid, or a piece of bladder securely tied over, so as perfectly to exclude the air.

10136-8{_}7252{_}_Mode_.--Procure the walnuts while young; be careful they are not woody, and prick them well with a fork; prepare a strong brine of salt and water (4 lbs.
10136-8{_}7253{_}of salt to each gallon of water), into which put the walnuts, letting them remain 9 days, and changing the brine every third day; drain them off, put them on a dish, place it in the sun until they become perfectly black, which will be in 2 or 3 days; have ready dry jars, into which place the walnuts, and do not quite fill the jars.
10136-8{_}7254{_}Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, for 10 minutes, with spices in the above proportion, and pour it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite covered with the pickle; tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place.
10136-8{_}7255{_}They will be fit for use in a month, and will keep good 2 or 3 years.
10136-8{_}7256{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.

10136-8{_}7287{_}[Illustration: THE WALNUT.]
10136-8{_}7288{_}THE WALNUT.--This nut is a native of Persia, and was introduced     into England from France.
10136-8{_}7289{_}As a pickle, it is much used in the     green state; and grated walnuts in Spain are much employed, both     in tarts and other dishes.
10136-8{_}7290{_}On the continent it is occasionally     employed as a substitute for olive oil in cooking; but it is     apt, under such circumstances, to become rancid.
10136-8{_}7291{_}The matter     which remains after the oil is extracted is considered highly     nutritious for poultry.
10136-8{_}7292{_}It is called _mare_, and in Switzerland     is eaten under the name of _pain amer_ by the poor.
10136-8{_}7293{_}The oil is     frequently manufactured into a kind of soap, and the leaves and     green husks yield an extract, which, as a brown dye, is used to     stain hair, wool, and wood.

10136-8{_}7323{_}VARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT.
10136-8{_}7324{_}CHAPTER XI.
10136-8{_}7325{_}GENERAL REMARKS.
10136-8{_}7326{_}540.
10136-8{_}7327{_}In Our "INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY" (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}7328{_}76) we have described the gradual progress of mankind in the art of cookery, the probability being, that the human race, for a long period, lived wholly on fruits.
10136-8{_}7329{_}Man's means of attacking animals, even if he had the desire of slaughtering them, were very limited, until he acquired the use of arms.
10136-8{_}7330{_}He, however, made weapons for himself, and, impelled by a carnivorous instinct, made prey of the animals that surrounded him.
10136-8{_}7331{_}It is natural that man should seek to feed on flesh; he has too small a stomach to be supported alone by fruit, which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him.
10136-8{_}7332{_}It is possible he might subsist on vegetables; but their preparation needs the knowledge of art, only to be obtained after the lapse of many centuries.
10136-8{_}7333{_}Man's first weapons were the branches of trees, which were succeeded by bows and arrows, and it is worthy of remark, that these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all climates and latitudes.
10136-8{_}7334{_}It is singular how this idea presented itself to individuals so differently placed.
10136-8{_}7335{_}541.
10136-8{_}7336{_}BRILLAT SAVARIN says, that raw flesh has but one inconvenience,--from its viscousness it attaches itself to the teeth.
10136-8{_}7337{_}He goes on to say, that it is not, however, disagreeable; but, when seasoned with salt, that it is easily digested.
10136-8{_}7338{_}He tells a story of a Croat captain, whom he invited to dinner in 1815, during the occupation of Paris by the allied troops.
10136-8{_}7339{_}This officer was amazed at his host's preparations, and said, "When we are campaigning, and get hungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with salt, which we always have in the sabretasche, put it under the saddle, gallop over it for half a mile, and then dine like princes."
10136-8{_}7340{_}Again, of the huntsmen of Dauphiny it is said, that when they are out shooting in September, they take with them both pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7341{_}If they kill a very fat bird, they pluck and season it, and, after carrying it some time in their caps, eat it.
10136-8{_}7342{_}This, they declare, is the best way of serving it up.
10136-8{_}7343{_}542.
10136-8{_}7344{_}SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE CROAT MODE, which, doubtless, was in fashion in the earlier ages of the world, fire was discovered.
10136-8{_}7345{_}This was an accident; for fire is not, although we are accustomed to call it so, an element, or spontaneous.
10136-8{_}7346{_}Many savage nations have been found utterly ignorant of it, and many races had no other way of dressing their food than by exposing it to the rays of the sun.
10136-8{_}7347{_}543.
10136-8{_}7348{_}THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARIAN ISLANDS, which were discovered in 1521, had no idea of fire.
10136-8{_}7349{_}Never was astonishment greater than theirs when they first saw it, on the descent of Magellan, the navigator, on one of their isles.
10136-8{_}7350{_}At first they thought it a kind of animal, that fixed itself to and fed upon wood.
10136-8{_}7351{_}Some of them, who approached too near, being burnt, the rest were terrified, and durst only look upon it at a distance.
10136-8{_}7352{_}They were afraid, they said, of being bit, or lest that dreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful breath; for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and flame.
10136-8{_}7353{_}Such, too, probably, were the notions the Greeks originally formed of them.
10136-8{_}7354{_}544.
10136-8{_}7355{_}FIRE HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED, mankind endeavoured to make use of it for drying, and afterwards for cooking their meat; but they were a considerable time before they hit upon proper and commodious methods of employing it in the preparation of their food.
10136-8{_}7356{_}545.
10136-8{_}7357{_}MEAT, THEN, PLACED ON BURNING FUEL was found better than when raw: it had more firmness, was eaten with less difficulty, and the ozmazome being condensed by the carbonization, gave it a pleasing perfume and flavour.
10136-8{_}7358{_}Still, however, the meat cooked on the coal would become somewhat befouled, certain portions of the fuel adhering to it.
10136-8{_}7359{_}This disadvantage was remedied by passing spits through it, and placing it at a suitable height above the burning fuel.
10136-8{_}7360{_}Thus grilling was invented; and it is well known that, simple as is this mode of cookery, yet all meat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly flavoured.
10136-8{_}7361{_}In Homer's time, the, art of cookery had not advanced much beyond this; for we read in the "Iliad," how the great Achilles and his friend Patroclus regaled the three Grecian leaders on bread, wine, and broiled meat.
10136-8{_}7362{_}It is noticeable, too, that Homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere in his poems.
10136-8{_}7363{_}Later, however, the Jews, coming out of their captivity in Egypt, had made much greater progress.
10136-8{_}7364{_}They undoubtedly possessed kettles; and in one of these, Esau's mess of pottage, for which he sold his birthright, must have been prepared.
10136-8{_}7365{_}546.
10136-8{_}7366{_}HAVING THUS BRIEFLY TRACED A HISTORY OF GASTRONOMICAL PROGRESSES, we will now proceed to describe the various methods of cooking meat, and make a few observations on the chemical changes which occur in each of the operations.
10136-8{_}7367{_}547.
10136-8{_}7368{_}IN THIS COUNTRY, plain boiling, roasting, and baking are the usual methods of cooking animal food.
10136-8{_}7369{_}To explain the philosophy of these simple culinary operations, we must advert to the effects that are produced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh.
10136-8{_}7370{_}When finely-chopped mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small quantity of clean water, and then subjected to slight pressure, the juice of the meat is extracted, and there is left a white tasteless residue, consisting chiefly of muscular fibres.
10136-8{_}7371{_}When this residue is heated to between 158° and 177° Fahrenheit, the fibres shrink together, and become hard and horny.
10136-8{_}7372{_}The influence of an elevated temperature on the soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable.
10136-8{_}7373{_}When the watery infusion, which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat, is gradually heated, it soon becomes turbid; and, when the temperature reaches 133°, flakes of whitish matter separate.
10136-8{_}7374{_}These flakes are _albumen_, a substance precisely similar, in all its properties, to the white of egg (see No.
10136-8{_}7375{_}101).
10136-8{_}7376{_}When the temperature of the watery extract is raised to 158°, the colouring matter of the blood coagulates, and the liquid, which was originally tinged red by this substance, is left perfectly clear, and almost colourless.
10136-8{_}7377{_}When evaporated, even at a gentle heat, this residual liquid gradually becomes brown, and acquires the flavour of roast meat.
10136-8{_}7378{_}548.
10136-8{_}7379{_}THESE INTERESTING FACTS, discovered in the laboratory, throw a flood of light upon the mysteries of the kitchen.
10136-8{_}7380{_}The fibres of meat are surrounded by a liquid which contains albumen in its soluble state, just as it exists in the unboiled egg.
10136-8{_}7381{_}During the operation of boiling or roasting, this substance coagulates, and thereby prevents the contraction and hardening of the fibres.
10136-8{_}7382{_}The tenderness of well-cooked meat is consequently proportioned to the amount of albumen deposited in its substance.
10136-8{_}7383{_}Meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout only to the temperature of coagulating albumen: it is thoroughly done when it has been heated through its whole mass to the temperature at which the colouring matter of the blood coagulates: it is overdone when the heat has been continued long enough to harden the fibres.
10136-8{_}7384{_}549.
10136-8{_}7385{_}THE JUICE OF FLESH IS WATER, holding in solution many substances besides albumen, which are of the highest possible value as articles of food.
10136-8{_}7386{_}In preparing meat for the table, great care should be taken to prevent the escape of this precious juice, as the succulence and sapidity of the meat depend on its retention.
10136-8{_}7387{_}The meat to be cooked should be exposed at first to a quick heat, which immediately coagulates the albumen on and near the surface.
10136-8{_}7388{_}A kind of shell is thus formed, which effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat.
10136-8{_}7389{_}550.
10136-8{_}7390{_}DURING THE OPERATIONS OF BOILING, BOASTING, AND BAKING, fresh beef and mutton, when moderately fat, lose, according to Johnston, on an average about--                        In boiling.
10136-8{_}7391{_}In baking.

10136-8{_}7405{_}BAKING.
10136-8{_}7406{_}[Illustration: BAKING DISH.]
10136-8{_}7407{_}551.
10136-8{_}7408{_}THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROASTING MEAT AND BAKING IT, may be generally described as consisting in the fact, that, in baking it, the fumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the same way as occurs in roasting.
10136-8{_}7409{_}Much, however, of this disadvantage is obviated by the improved construction of modern ovens, and of especially those in connection with the Leamington kitchener, of which we give an engraving here, and a full description of which will be seen at paragraph No.
10136-8{_}7410{_}65, with the prices at which they can be purchased of Messrs. R. and J.
10136-8{_}7411{_}Slack, of the Strand.
10136-8{_}7412{_}With meat baked in the generality of ovens, however, which do not possess ventilators on the principle of this kitchener, there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste, which does not at all equal the flavour developed by roasting meat.
10136-8{_}7413{_}The chemistry of baking may be said to be the same as that described in roasting.
10136-8{_}7414{_}552.
10136-8{_}7415{_}SHOULD THE OVEN BE VERY BRISK, it will be found necessary to cover the joint with a piece of white paper, to prevent the meat from being scorched and blackened outside, before the heat can penetrate into the inside.
10136-8{_}7416{_}This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of serving dinner, so that the joint may take a good colour.
10136-8{_}7417{_}553.
10136-8{_}7418{_}BY MEANS OF A JAR, many dishes, which will be enumerated under their special heads, may be economically prepared in the oven.
10136-8{_}7419{_}The principal of these are soup, gravies, jugged hare, beef tea; and this mode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham, which has previously been covered with a common crust of flour and water.
10136-8{_}7420{_}554.
10136-8{_}7421{_}ALL DISHES PREPARED FOR BAKING should be more highly seasoned than when intended to be roasted.
10136-8{_}7422{_}There are some dishes which, it may be said, are at least equally well cooked in the oven as by the roaster; thus, a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes, a fillet or breast of veal, a sucking pig, a hare, well basted, will be received by connoisseurs as well, when baked, as if they had been roasted.
10136-8{_}7423{_}Indeed, the baker's oven, or the family oven, may often, as has been said, be substituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and convenience.
10136-8{_}7424{_}555.
10136-8{_}7425{_}A BAKING-DISH, of which we give an engraving, should not be less than 6 or 7 inches deep; so that the meat, which of course cannot be basted, can stew in its own juices.
10136-8{_}7426{_}In the recipe for each dish, full explanations concerning any special points in relation to it will be given.
10136-8{_}7427{_}BOILING.
10136-8{_}7428{_}556.
10136-8{_}7429{_}BOILING, or the preparation of meat by hot water, though one of the easiest processes in cookery, requires skilful management.
10136-8{_}7430{_}Boiled meat should be tender, savoury, and full of its own juice, or natural gravy; but, through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks, it is too often sent to table hard, tasteless, and innutritious.
10136-8{_}7431{_}To insure a successful result in boiling flesh, the heat of the fire must be judiciously regulated, the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the pot, and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed.
10136-8{_}7432{_}557.
10136-8{_}7433{_}MANY WRITERS ON COOKERY assert that the meat to be boiled should be put into cold water, and that the pot should be heated gradually; but Liebig, the highest authority on all matters connected with the chemistry of food, has shown that meat so treated loses some of its most nutritious constituents.
10136-8{_}7434{_}"If the flesh," says the great chemist, "be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes, and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that the temperature of the water is kept at 158° to 165°, we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit it for being eaten."
10136-8{_}7435{_}When a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water, the albumen which is near the surface immediately coagulates, forming an envelope, which prevents the escape of the internal juice, and most effectually excludes the water, which, by mixing with this juice, would render the meat insipid.
10136-8{_}7436{_}Meat treated thus is juicy and well-flavoured, when cooked, as it retains most of its savoury constituents.
10136-8{_}7437{_}On the other hand, if the piece of meat be set on the fire with cold water, and this slowly heated to boiling, the flesh undergoes a loss of soluble and nutritious substances, while, as a matter of course, the soup becomes richer in these matters.
10136-8{_}7438{_}The albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to the centre; the fibre loses, more or less, its quality of shortness or tenderness, and becomes hard and tough: the thinner the piece of meat is, the greater is its loss of savoury constituents.
10136-8{_}7439{_}In order to obtain well-flavoured and eatable meat, we must relinquish the idea of making good soup from it, as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup gives the driest, toughest, and most vapid meat.
10136-8{_}7440{_}Slow boiling whitens the meat; and, we suspect, that it is on this account that it is in such favour with the cooks.
10136-8{_}7441{_}The wholesomeness of food is, however, a matter of much greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table.
10136-8{_}7442{_}It should be borne in mind, that the whiteness of meat that has been boiled slowly, is produced by the loss of some important alimentary properties.
10136-8{_}7443{_}558.
10136-8{_}7444{_}THE OBJECTIONS WE HAVE RAISED to the practice of putting meat on the fire in cold water, apply with equal force to the practice of soaking meat before cooking it, which is so strongly recommended by some cooks.
10136-8{_}7445{_}Fresh meat ought never to be soaked, as all its most nutritive constituents are soluble in water.
10136-8{_}7446{_}Soaking, however, is an operation that cannot be entirely dispensed with in the preparation of animal food.
10136-8{_}7447{_}Salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time in water before they are cooked.
10136-8{_}7448{_}559.
10136-8{_}7449{_}FOR BOILING MEAT, the softer the water is, the better.
10136-8{_}7450{_}When spring water is boiled, the chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness, is precipitated.
10136-8{_}7451{_}This chalk stains the meat, and communicates to it an unpleasant earthy taste.
10136-8{_}7452{_}When nothing but hard water can be procured, it should be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used for culinary purposes.
10136-8{_}7453{_}560.
10136-8{_}7454{_}THE FIRE MUST BE WATCHED with great attention during the operation of boiling, so that its heat may be properly regulated.
10136-8{_}7455{_}As a rule, the pot should be kept in a simmering state; a result which cannot be attained without vigilance.
10136-8{_}7456{_}561.
10136-8{_}7457{_}THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH WATER BOILS, under usual circumstances, is 212° Fahr.
10136-8{_}7458{_}Water does not become hotter after it has begun to boil, however long or with whatever violence the boiling is continued.
10136-8{_}7459{_}This fact is of great importance in cookery, and attention to it will save much fuel.
10136-8{_}7460{_}Water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a moderate heat is just as hot as when it is made to boil on a strong fire with the greatest possible violence.
10136-8{_}7461{_}When once water has been brought to the boiling point, the fire may be considerably reduced, as a very gentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature.
10136-8{_}7462{_}562.
10136-8{_}7463{_}THE SCUM WHICH RISES to the surface of the pot during the operation of boiling must be carefully removed, otherwise it will attach itself to the meat, and thereby spoil its appearance.
10136-8{_}7464{_}The cook must not neglect to skim during the whole process, though by far the greater part of the scum rises at first.
10136-8{_}7465{_}The practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be dispensed with if the skimming be skillfully managed.
10136-8{_}7466{_}If the scum be removed as fast as it rises, the meat will be cooked clean and pure, and come out of the vessel in which it was boiled, much more delicate and firm than when cooked in a cloth.
10136-8{_}7467{_}563.
10136-8{_}7468{_}WHEN TAKEN FROM THE POT, the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth, or, what will be found more convenient, a sponge previously dipped in water and wrung dry.
10136-8{_}7469{_}The meat should not be allowed to stand a moment longer than necessary, as boiled meat, as well as roasted, cannot be eaten too hot.
10136-8{_}7470{_}564.
10136-8{_}7471{_}THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THE OPERATION OF BOILING must be regulated according to the size and quality of the meat.
10136-8{_}7472{_}As a general rule, twenty minutes, reckoning from the moment when the boiling commences, may be allowed for every pound of meat.
10136-8{_}7473{_}All the best authorities, however, agree in this, that the longer the boiling the more perfect the operation.
10136-8{_}7474{_}565.
10136-8{_}7475{_}A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF SALTED MEAT may be properly introduced in this place.
10136-8{_}7476{_}Every housewife knows that dry salt in contact with fresh meat gradually becomes fluid brine.
10136-8{_}7477{_}The application of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract, and the juice to flow out from its pores: as much as one-third of the juice of the meat is often forced out in this manner.
10136-8{_}7478{_}Now, as this juice is pure extract of meat, containing albumen, osmazome, and other valuable principles, it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action of salt can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat.
10136-8{_}7479{_}566.
10136-8{_}7480{_}THE VESSELS USED FOR BOILING should be made of cast-iron, well tinned within, and provided with closely-fitting lids.
10136-8{_}7481{_}They must be kept scrupulously clean, otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them unsightly and unwholesome.
10136-8{_}7482{_}Copper pans, if used at all, should be reserved for operations that are performed with rapidity; as, by long contact with copper, food may become dangerously contaminated.
10136-8{_}7483{_}The kettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room for a good supply of water; if the meat be cramped and be surrounded with but little water, it will be stewed, not boiled.
10136-8{_}7484{_}567.
10136-8{_}7485{_}IN STEWING, IT IS NOT REQUISITE to have so great a heat as in boiling.
10136-8{_}7486{_}A gentle simmering in a small quantity of water, so that the meat is stewed almost in its own juices, is all that is necessary.
10136-8{_}7487{_}It is a method much used on the continent, and is wholesome and economical.
10136-8{_}7488{_}[Illustration: BOILING-POT.]
10136-8{_}7489{_}[Illustration: STEWPAN.]
10136-8{_}7490{_}Two useful culinary vessels are represented above.
10136-8{_}7491{_}One is a     boiling-pot, in which large joints may be boiled; the other is a     stewpan, with a closely-fitting lid, to which is attached a long     handle; so that the cover can be removed without scalding the     fingers.
10136-8{_}7492{_}[Illustration: HOT-PLATE.]
10136-8{_}7493{_}568.
10136-8{_}7494{_}THE HOT-PLATE is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges, being used for boiling and stewing.
10136-8{_}7495{_}It is a plate of cast iron, having a closed fire burning beneath it, by which it is thoroughly well heated.
10136-8{_}7496{_}On this plate are set the various saucepans, stewpans, &c.; and, by this convenient and economical method, a number of dishes may be prepared at one time.
10136-8{_}7497{_}The culinary processes of braising and stewing are, in this manner, rendered more gradual, and consequently the substance acted on becomes more tender, and the gravy is not so much reduced.
10136-8{_}7498{_}BROILING.
10136-8{_}7499{_}[Illustration: REVOLVING GRIDIRON.]
10136-8{_}7500{_}569.
10136-8{_}7501{_}GENERALLY SPEAKING, small dishes only are prepared by this mode of cooking; amongst these, the beef-steak and mutton chop of the solitary English diner may be mentioned as celebrated all the world over.
10136-8{_}7502{_}Our beef-steak, indeed, has long crossed the Channel; and, with a view of pleasing the Britons, there is in every _carte_ at every French restaurant, by the side of _à la Marengo_, and _à la Mayonnaise,--bifteck d'Angleterre_.
10136-8{_}7503{_}In order to succeed in a broil, the cook must have a bright, clear fire; so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated.
10136-8{_}7504{_}The result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting; namely, that a crust, so to speak, is formed outside, and thus the juices of the meat are retained.
10136-8{_}7505{_}The appetite of an invalid, so difficult to minister to, is often pleased with a broiled dish, as the flavour and sapidity of the meat are so well preserved.
10136-8{_}7506{_}570.
10136-8{_}7507{_}THE UTENSILS USED FOR BROILING need but little description.

10136-8{_}7509{_}68, is the same as it has been for ages past, although some little variety has been introduced into its manufacture, by the addition of grooves to the bars, by means of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough.
10136-8{_}7510{_}One point it is well to bear in mind, viz., that the gridiron should be kept in a direction slanting towards the cook, so that as little fat as possible may fall into the fire.
10136-8{_}7511{_}It has been observed, that broiling is the most difficult manual office the general cook has to perform, and one that requires the most unremitting attention; for she may turn her back upon the stewpan or the spit, but the gridiron can never be left with impunity.
10136-8{_}7512{_}The revolving gridiron, shown in the engraving, possesses some advantages of convenience, which will be at once apparent.
10136-8{_}7513{_}FRYING.
10136-8{_}7514{_}[Illustration: SAUTÉ PAN.]
10136-8{_}7515{_}571.
10136-8{_}7516{_}THIS VERY FAVOURITE MODE OF COOKING may be accurately described as boiling in fat or oil.
10136-8{_}7517{_}Substances dressed in this way are generally well received, for they introduce an agreeable variety, possessing, as they do, a peculiar flavour.
10136-8{_}7518{_}By means of frying, cooks can soon satisfy many requisitions made on them, it being a very expeditious mode of preparing dishes for the table, and one which can be employed when the fire is not sufficiently large for the purposes of roasting and boiling.
10136-8{_}7519{_}The great point to be borne in mind in frying, is that the liquid must be hot enough to act instantaneously, as all the merit of this culinary operation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid, which carbonizes or burns, at the very instant of the immersion of the body placed in it.
10136-8{_}7520{_}It may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree, by cutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the frying-pan for five or six seconds; and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out, put in immediately what you wish to prepare; if it be not, let the fat be heated until of the right temperature.
10136-8{_}7521{_}This having been effected, moderate the fire, so that the action may not be too hurried, and that by a continuous heat the juices of the substance may be preserved, and its flavour enhanced.
10136-8{_}7522{_}572.
10136-8{_}7523{_}THE PHILOSOPHY OF FRYING consists in this, that liquids subjected to the action of fire do not all receive the same quantity of heat.
10136-8{_}7524{_}Being differently constituted in their nature, they possess different "capacities for caloric."
10136-8{_}7525{_}Thus, you may, with impunity, dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine; you would take it very quickly from boiling brandy, yet more rapidly from water; whilst the effects of the most rapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told.
10136-8{_}7526{_}As a consequence of this, heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to them.
10136-8{_}7527{_}Those put in water, dissolve, and are reduced to a soft mass; the result being _bouillon_, stock, &c. (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}7528{_}103).
10136-8{_}7529{_}Those substances, on the contrary, treated with oil, harden, assume a more or less deep colour, and are finally carbonized.
10136-8{_}7530{_}The reason of these different results is, that, in the first instance, water dissolves and extracts the interior juices of the alimentary substances placed in it; whilst, in the second, the juices are preserved; for they are insoluble in oil.
10136-8{_}7531{_}573.
10136-8{_}7532{_}IT IS TO BE ESPECIALLY REMEMBERED, in connection with frying, that all dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of blotting-paper, or sieve reversed, and there left for a few minutes, so that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed.
10136-8{_}7533{_}574.
10136-8{_}7534{_}THE UTENSILS USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF FRYING are confined to frying-pans, although these are of various sizes; and, for small and delicate dishes, such as collops, fritters, pancakes, &c., the _sauté_ pan, of which we give an engraving, is used.
10136-8{_}7535{_}COOKING BY GAS.
10136-8{_}7536{_}[Illustration: GAS STOVE.]
10136-8{_}7537{_}575.
10136-8{_}7538{_}GAS-COOKING can scarcely now be considered a novelty,--many establishments, both small and large, have been fitted with apparatus for cooking by this mode, which undoubtedly exhibits some advantages.
10136-8{_}7539{_}Thus the heat may be more regularly supplied to the substance cooking, and the operation is essentially a clean one, because there can be no cinders or other dirt to be provided for.
10136-8{_}7540{_}Some labour and attention necessary, too, with a coal fire or close stove, may be saved; and, besides this, it may, perhaps, be said that culinary operations are reduced, by this means, to something like a certainty.
10136-8{_}7541{_}576.
10136-8{_}7542{_}THERE ARE, HOWEVER, WE THINK, MANY OBJECTIONS to this mode of cooking, more especially when applied to small domestic establishments.
10136-8{_}7543{_}For instance, the ingenious machinery necessary for carrying it out, requires cooks perfectly conversant with its use; and if the gas, when the cooking operations are finished, be not turned off, there will be a large increase in the cost of cooking, instead of the economy which it has been supposed to bring.
10136-8{_}7544{_}For large establishments, such as some of the immense London warehouses, where a large number of young men have to be catered for daily, it may be well adapted, as it is just possible that a slight increase in the supply of gas necessary for a couple of joints, may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes.
10136-8{_}7545{_}ROASTING.
10136-8{_}7546{_}577.
10136-8{_}7547{_}OF THE VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING MEAT, ROASTING is that which most effectually preserves its nutritive qualities.
10136-8{_}7548{_}Meat is roasted by being exposed to the direct influence of the fire.
10136-8{_}7549{_}This is done by placing the meat before an open grate, and keeping it in motion to prevent the scorching on any particular part.
10136-8{_}7550{_}When meat is properly roasted, the outer layer of its albumen is coagulated, and thus presents a barrier to the exit of the juice.
10136-8{_}7551{_}In roasting meat, the heat must be strongest at first, and it should then be much reduced.
10136-8{_}7552{_}To have a good juicy roast, therefore, the fire must be red and vigorous at the very commencement of the operation.
10136-8{_}7553{_}In the most careful roasting, some of the juice is squeezed out of the meat: this evaporates on the surface of the meat, and gives it a dark brown colour, a rich lustre, and a strong aromatic taste.
10136-8{_}7554{_}Besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled juice, roasting converts the cellular tissue of the meat into gelatine, and melts the fat out of the fat-cells.
10136-8{_}7555{_}578.
10136-8{_}7556{_}IF A SPIT is used to support the meat before the fire, it should be kept quite bright.
10136-8{_}7557{_}Sand and water ought to be used to scour it with, for brickdust and oil may give a disagreeable taste to the meat.
10136-8{_}7558{_}When well scoured, it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth; and, in spitting the meat, the prime parts should be left untouched, so as to avoid any great escape of its juices.
10136-8{_}7559{_}579.
10136-8{_}7560{_}KITCHENS IN LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS are usually fitted with what are termed "smoke-jacks."
10136-8{_}7561{_}By means of these, several spits, if required, may be turned at the same time.
10136-8{_}7562{_}This not being, of course, necessary in smaller establishments, a roasting apparatus, more economical in its consumption of coal, is more frequently in use.
10136-8{_}7563{_}[Illustration: BOTTLE-JACK, WITH WHEEL AND HOOK.]
10136-8{_}7564{_}580.
10136-8{_}7565{_}THE BOTTLE-JACK, of which we here give an illustration, with the wheel and hook, and showing the precise manner of using it, is now commonly used in many kitchens.
10136-8{_}7566{_}This consists of a spring inclosed in a brass cylinder, and requires winding up before it is used, and sometimes, also, during the operation of roasting.
10136-8{_}7567{_}The joint is fixed to an iron hook, which is suspended by a chain connected with a wheel, and which, in its turn, is connected with the bottle-jack.
10136-8{_}7568{_}Beneath it stands the dripping-pan, which we have also engraved, together with the basting-ladle, the use of which latter should not be spared; as there can be no good roast without good basting.
10136-8{_}7569{_}"Spare the rod, and spoil the child," might easily be paraphrased into "Spare the basting, and spoil the meat."
10136-8{_}7570{_}If the joint is small and light, and so turns unsteadily, this may be remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights.
10136-8{_}7571{_}Sometimes this jack is fixed inside a screen; but there is this objection to this apparatus,--that the meat cooked in it resembles the flavour of baked meat.
10136-8{_}7572{_}This is derived from its being so completely surrounded with the tin, that no sufficient current of air gets to it.
10136-8{_}7573{_}It will be found preferable to make use of a common meat-screen, such as is shown in the woodcut.
10136-8{_}7574{_}This contains shelves for warming plates and dishes; and with this, the reflection not being so powerful, and more air being admitted to the joint, the roast may be very excellently cooked.
10136-8{_}7575{_}[Illustration: DRIPPING-PAN AND BASTING-LADLE.]
10136-8{_}7576{_}581.
10136-8{_}7577{_}IN STIRRING THE FIRE, or putting fresh coals on it, the dripping-pan should always be drawn back, so that there may be no danger of the coal, cinders, or ashes falling down into it.
10136-8{_}7578{_}582.
10136-8{_}7579{_}UNDER EACH PARTICULAR RECIPE there is stated the time required for roasting each joint; but, as a general rule, it may be here given, that for every pound of meat, in ordinary-sized joints, a quarter of an hour may be allotted.
10136-8{_}7580{_}[Illustration: HEAT-SCREEN.]
10136-8{_}7581{_}583.
10136-8{_}7582{_}WHITE MEATS, AND THE MEAT OF YOUNG ANIMALS, require to be very well roasted, both to be pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion.
10136-8{_}7583{_}Thus veal, pork, and lamb, should be thoroughly done to the centre.
10136-8{_}7584{_}584.
10136-8{_}7585{_}MUTTON AND BEEF, on the other hand, do not, generally speaking, require to be so thoroughly done, and they should be dressed to the point, that, in carving them, the gravy should just run, but not too freely.
10136-8{_}7586{_}Of course in this, as in most other dishes, the tastes of individuals vary; and there are many who cannot partake, with satisfaction, of any joint unless it is what others would call overdressed.
10136-8{_}7587{_}[Illustration]     [Illustration]  QUADRUPEDS.
10136-8{_}7588{_}CHAPTER XII.
10136-8{_}7589{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON QUADRUPEDS.
10136-8{_}7590{_}585.
10136-8{_}7591{_}BY THE GENERAL ASSENT OF MANKIND, THE EMPIRE OF NATURE has been divided into three kingdoms; the first consisting of minerals, the second of vegetables, and the third of animals.
10136-8{_}7592{_}The Mineral Kingdom comprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion, and the due performance of the functions of life.
10136-8{_}7593{_}They are composed of the accidental aggregation of particles, which, under certain circumstances, take a constant and regular figure, but which are more frequently found without any definite conformation.
10136-8{_}7594{_}They also occupy the interior parts of the earth, as well as compose those huge masses by which we see the land in some parts guarded against the encroachments of the sea.
10136-8{_}7595{_}The Vegetable Kingdom covers and beautifies the earth with an endless variety of form and colour.
10136-8{_}7596{_}It consists of organized bodies, but destitute of the power of locomotion.
10136-8{_}7597{_}They are nourished by means of roots; they breathe by means of leaves; and propagate by means of seed, dispersed within certain limits.
10136-8{_}7598{_}The Animal Kingdom consists of sentient beings, that enliven the external parts of the earth.
10136-8{_}7599{_}They possess the powers of voluntary motion, respire air, and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of thirst, by the instincts of animal passion, or by pain.
10136-8{_}7600{_}Like the vegetable kingdom, they are limited within the boundaries of certain countries by the conditions of climate and soil; and some of the species prey upon each other.
10136-8{_}7601{_}Linnaeus has divided them into six classes;--Mammalia, Birds, Fishes, Amphibious Animals, Insects, and Worms.
10136-8{_}7602{_}The three latter do not come within the limits of our domain; of fishes we have already treated, of birds we shall treat, and of mammalia we will now treat.
10136-8{_}7603{_}586.
10136-8{_}7604{_}THIS CLASS OF ANIMALS embraces all those that nourish their young by means of lacteal glands, or teats, and are so constituted as to have a warm or red blood.
10136-8{_}7605{_}In it the whale is placed,--an order which, from external habits, has usually been classed with the fishes; but, although this animal exclusively inhabits the water, and is supplied with fins, it nevertheless exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds.
10136-8{_}7606{_}It has warm blood, and produces its young alive; it nourishes them with milk, and, for that purpose, is furnished with teats.
10136-8{_}7607{_}It is also supplied with lungs, and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart; all of which bring it still closer into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of the animal kingdom.
10136-8{_}7608{_}587.
10136-8{_}7609{_}THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAMMALIA have been frequently noticed.
10136-8{_}7610{_}The bodies of nearly the whole species are covered with hair, a kind of clothing which is both soft and warm, little liable to injury, and bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the nature of the climate it inhabits.
10136-8{_}7611{_}In all the higher orders of animals, the head is the principal seat of the organs of sense.
10136-8{_}7612{_}It is there that the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth are placed.
10136-8{_}7613{_}Through the last they receive their nourishment.
10136-8{_}7614{_}In it are the _teeth_, which, in most of the mammalia, are used not only for the mastication of food, but as weapons of offence.
10136-8{_}7615{_}They are inserted into two movable bones called jaws, and the front teeth are so placed that their sharp edges may easily be brought in contact with their food, in order that its fibres may readily be separated.
10136-8{_}7616{_}Next to these, on each side, are situated the canine teeth, or tusks, which are longer than the other teeth, and, being pointed, are used to tear the food.
10136-8{_}7617{_}In the back jaws are placed another form of teeth, called grinders.
10136-8{_}7618{_}These are for masticating the food; and in those animals that live on vegetables, they are flattened at the top; but, in carnivora, their upper surfaces are furnished with sharp-pointed protuberances.
10136-8{_}7619{_}From the numbers, form, and disposition of the teeth, the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged.
10136-8{_}7620{_}The _nose_ is a cartilaginous body, pierced with two holes, which are called nostrils.
10136-8{_}7621{_}Through these the animal is affected by the sense of smell; and in some it is prominent, whilst in others it is flat, compressed, turned upwards, or bent downwards.
10136-8{_}7622{_}In beasts of prey, it is frequently longer than the lips; and in some other animals it is elongated into a movable trunk or proboscis, whilst, in the rhinoceros tribe, it is armed with a horn.
10136-8{_}7623{_}The _eyes_ of quadrupeds are generally defended by movable lids, on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair, called eyelashes.
10136-8{_}7624{_}The opening of the pupil is in general circular; but to some species, as in those of the Cat and Hare, it is contracted into a perpendicular line, whilst in the Horse, the Ox, and a few others, it forms a transverse bar.
10136-8{_}7625{_}The _ears_ are openings, generally accompanied with a cartilage which defends and covers them, called the external ears.
10136-8{_}7626{_}In water-animals the latter are wanting; sound, in them, being transmitted merely through orifices in the head, which have the name of auditory-holes.
10136-8{_}7627{_}The most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in the sense of hearing, as are likewise most beasts of prey.
10136-8{_}7628{_}Most of the mammiferous animals _walk_ on four feet, which, at the extremities, are usually divided into toes or fingers.
10136-8{_}7629{_}In some, however, the feet end in a single corneous substance called a hoof.
10136-8{_}7630{_}The toes of a few end in broad, flat nails, and of most others, in pointed claws.
10136-8{_}7631{_}Some, again, have the toes connected by a membrane, which is adapted to those that are destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water.
10136-8{_}7632{_}Others, again, as in the Bat, have the digitations of the anterior feet greatly elongated, the intervening space being filled by a membrane, which extends round the hinder legs and tail, and by means of which they are enabled to rise into the air.
10136-8{_}7633{_}In Man, the hand alone comprises fingers, separate, free, and flexible; but Apes, and some other kinds of animals, have fingers both to the hands and feet.
10136-8{_}7634{_}These, therefore, are the only animals that can hold movable objects in a single hand.
10136-8{_}7635{_}Others, such as Rats and Squirrels, have the fingers sufficiently small and flexible to enable them to pick up objects; but they are compelled to hold them in both hands.
10136-8{_}7636{_}Others, again, have the toes shorter, and must rest on the fore-feet, as is the case with dogs and cats when they wish to hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws.
10136-8{_}7637{_}There are still others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin, or enveloped in corneous hoofs, and are thereby enabled to exercise no prehensile power whatever.
10136-8{_}7638{_}588.
10136-8{_}7639{_}ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN AND END OF NATURE, mammiferous animals are calculated, when arrived at maturity, to subsist on various kinds of food,--some to live wholly upon flesh, others upon grain, herbs, or fruits; but in their infant state, milk is the appropriate food of the whole.
10136-8{_}7640{_}That this food may never fail them, it is universally ordained, that the young should no sooner come into the world, than the milk should flow in abundance into the members with which the mother is supplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid.
10136-8{_}7641{_}By a wonderful instinct of Nature, too, the young animal, almost as soon as it has come into life, searches for the teat, and knows perfectly, at the first, how, by the process of suction, it will be able to extract the fluid necessary to its existence.
10136-8{_}7642{_}589.
10136-8{_}7643{_}IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF NATURE, this class of animals seems destined to preserve a constant equilibrium in the number of animated beings that hold their existence on the surface of the earth.
10136-8{_}7644{_}To man they are immediately useful in various ways.
10136-8{_}7645{_}Some of their bodies afford him food, their skin shoes, and their fleece clothes.
10136-8{_}7646{_}Some of them unite with him in participating the dangers of combat with an enemy, and others assist him in the chase, in exterminating wilder sorts, or banishing them from the haunts of civilization.
10136-8{_}7647{_}Many, indeed, are injurious to him; but most of them, in some shape or other, he turns to his service.
10136-8{_}7648{_}Of these there is none he has made more subservient to his purposes than the common ox, of which there is scarcely a part that he has not been able to convert into some useful purpose.
10136-8{_}7649{_}Of the horns he makes drinking-vessels, knife-handles, combs, and boxes; and when they are softened by means of boiling water, he fashions them into transparent plates for lanterns.
10136-8{_}7650{_}This invention is ascribed to King Alfred, who is said to have been the first to use them to preserve his candle time-measures from the wind.
10136-8{_}7651{_}Glue is made of the cartilages, gristles, and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides.
10136-8{_}7652{_}Their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory.
10136-8{_}7653{_}The thinnest of the calf-skins are manufactured into vellum.
10136-8{_}7654{_}Their blood is made the basis of Prussian blue, and saddlers use a fine sort of thread prepared from their sinews.
10136-8{_}7655{_}The hair is used in various valuable manufactures; the suet, fat, and tallow, are moulded into candles; and the milk and cream of the cow yield butter and cheese.
10136-8{_}7656{_}Thus is every part of this animal valuable to man, who has spared no pains to bring it to the highest state of perfection.
10136-8{_}7657{_}[Illustration: SHORT-HORN COW.]
10136-8{_}7658{_}[Illustration: SHORT-HORN BULL.]
10136-8{_}7659{_}590.
10136-8{_}7660{_}AMONG THE VARIOUS BREEDS OF THE OX, upon which man has bestowed his highest powers of culture, there is now none takes a higher place than that known by the name of Short-Horns.
10136-8{_}7661{_}From the earliest ages, Great Britain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native breeds of cattle, and there are none in England that have obtained greater celebrity than those which have this name, and which originated, about seventy years ago, on the banks of the Tees.
10136-8{_}7662{_}Thence they have spread into the valleys of the Tweed; thence to the Lothians, in Scotland; and southward, into the fine pastures of England.
10136-8{_}7663{_}They are now esteemed the most profitable breed of cattle, as there is no animal which attains sooner to maturity, and none that supplies meat of a superior quality.
10136-8{_}7664{_}The value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous.
10136-8{_}7665{_}At the sale of Mr. Charles Colling, a breeder in Yorkshire, in 1810, his bull "Comet" sold for 1,000 guineas.
10136-8{_}7666{_}At the sale of Earl Spencer's herd in 1846, 104 cows, heifers, and calves, with nineteen bulls, fetched £8,468.
10136-8{_}7667{_}5s.
10136-8{_}7668{_}; being an average of £68.
10136-8{_}7669{_}17s.
10136-8{_}7670{_}apiece.
10136-8{_}7671{_}The value of such animals is scarcely to be estimated by those who are unacquainted with the care with which they are tended, and with the anxious attention which is paid to the purity of their breed.
10136-8{_}7672{_}A modern writer, well acquainted with this subject, says, "There are now, at least, five hundred herds, large and small, in this kingdom, and from six to seven thousand head registered every alternate year in the herd-book."
10136-8{_}7673{_}The necessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than might, at first sight, be imagined, as it tends directly to preserve the character of the cattle, while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the animal thus entered.
10136-8{_}7674{_}Besides, many of the Americans, and large purchasers for the foreign market, will not look at an animal without the breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference.
10136-8{_}7675{_}Of short-horned stock, there is annually sold from £40,000 to £50,000 worth by public auction, independent of the vast numbers disposed of by private contract.
10136-8{_}7676{_}The brood is highly prized in Belgium, Prussia, France, Italy, and Russia; it is imported into most of the British colonies, and is greatly esteemed both for its meat and its dairy produce, wherever it is known.
10136-8{_}7677{_}The quickness with which it takes on flesh, and the weight which it frequently makes, are well known; but we may mention that it is not uncommon to tee steers of from four to five years old realize a weight of from 800 to 1,000 lbs.
10136-8{_}7678{_}Such animals command from the butcher from £30 to £40 per head, according to the quality; whilst others, of two or three years old, and, of course, of less Weight, bring as much as £20 apiece.
10136-8{_}7679{_}[Illustration: LONG-HORN BULL.]
10136-8{_}7680{_}[Illustration: LONG-HORN COW.]
10136-8{_}7681{_}591.
10136-8{_}7682{_}LONG-HORNS.--This is the prevailing breed in our midland counties and in Ireland; but they are greatly inferior to the short-horns, and are fast being supplanted by them.
10136-8{_}7683{_}Even where they have been cultivated with the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection, they are inferior to the others, and must ultimately be driven from the farm.

10136-8{_}7685{_}[Illustration: ALDERNEY BULL.]

10136-8{_}7687{_}THE ALDERNEY.--Among the dairy breeds of England, the Alderney takes a prominent place, not on account of the quantity of milk which it yields, but on account of the excellent quality of the cream and butter which are produced from it.
10136-8{_}7688{_}Its docility is marvellous, and in appearance it greatly resembles the Ayrshire breed of Scotland, the excellence of which is supposed to be, in some degree, derived from a mixture of the Alderney blood with that breed.
10136-8{_}7689{_}The distinction between them, however, lies both in the quantity and quality of the milk which they severally produce; that of the Alderney being rich in quality, and that of the Ayrshire abundant in quantity.
10136-8{_}7690{_}The merit of the former, however, ends with its milk, for as a grazer it is worthless.

10136-8{_}7693{_}593.
10136-8{_}7694{_}SCOTTISH BREEDS.--Of these the Kyloe, which belongs to the Highlands of Scotland; the Galloway, which has been called the Kyloe without horns; and the Ayrshire, are the breeds most celebrated.
10136-8{_}7695{_}The first has kept his place, and on account of the compactness of his form, and the excellent quality of his flesh, he is a great favourite with butchers who have a select family trade.
10136-8{_}7696{_}It is alike unsuitable for the dairy and the arable farm; but in its native Highlands it attains to great perfection, thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it gathers on the sides of the mountains.
10136-8{_}7697{_}The Galloway has a larger frame, and when fattened makes excellent beef.
10136-8{_}7698{_}But it has given place to the short-horns in its native district, where turnip-husbandry is pursued with advantage.
10136-8{_}7699{_}The Ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy, and for the abundance of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native district.
10136-8{_}7700{_}In this it stands unrivalled, and there is no other breed capable of converting the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter and cheese.
10136-8{_}7701{_}It is difficult to fatten, however, and its beef is of a coarse quality.
10136-8{_}7702{_}We have chosen these as among the principal representative breeds of the ox species; but there are other breeds which, at all events, have a local if not a general celebrity.
10136-8{_}7703{_}[Illustration: SIDE OF BEEF, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]
10136-8{_}7704{_}594.
10136-8{_}7705{_}The general Mode of Slaughtering Oxen in this country is by striking them a smart blow with a hammer or poleaxe on the head, a little above the eyes.
10136-8{_}7706{_}By this means, when the blow is skilfully given, the beast is brought down at one blow, and, to prevent recovery, a cane is generally inserted, by which the spinal cord is perforated, which instantly deprives the ox of all sensation of pain.
10136-8{_}7707{_}In Spain, and some other countries on the continent, it is also usual to deprive oxen of life by the operation of pithing or dividing the spinal cord in the neck, close to the back part of the head.
10136-8{_}7708{_}This is, in effect, the same mode as is practised in the celebrated Spanish bull-fights by the matador, and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation, if the operator be skilful.
10136-8{_}7709{_}We hope and believe that those men whose disagreeable duty it is to slaughter the "beasts of the field" to provide meat for mankind, inflict as little punishment and cause as little suffering as possible.
10136-8{_}7710{_}595.
10136-8{_}7711{_}THE MANNER IN WHICH A SIDE OF BEEF is cut up in London, is shown in the engraving on this page.
10136-8{_}7712{_}In the metropolis, on account of the large number of its population possessing the means to indulge in the "best of everything," the demand for the most delicate joints of meat is great, the price, at the same time, being much higher for these than for the other parts.
10136-8{_}7713{_}The consequence is, that in London the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most esteemed joints.
10136-8{_}7714{_}In many places, however, where, from a greater equality in the social condition and habits of the inhabitants, the demand and prices for the different parts of the carcasses are more equalized, there is not the same reason for the butcher to cut the best joints so large.
10136-8{_}7715{_}596.
10136-8{_}7716{_}THE MEAT ON THOSE PARTS OF THE ANIMAL in which the muscles are least called into action, is most tender and succulent; as, for instance, along the back, from the rump to the hinder part of the shoulder; whilst the limbs, shoulder, and neck, are the toughest, driest, and least-esteemed.
10136-8{_}7717{_}597.
10136-8{_}7718{_}THE NAMES OF THE SEVERAL JOINTS in the hind and fore quarters of a side of beef, and the purposes for which they are used, are as follows:--  HIND QUARTER.
10136-8{_}7719{_}1.
10136-8{_}7720{_}Sirloin.--The two sirloins, cut together in one joint, form a baron; this, when roasted, is the famous national dish of Englishmen, at entertainments, on occasion of rejoicing.

10136-8{_}7758{_}BAKED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}7759{_}I.
10136-8{_}7760{_}598.
10136-8{_}7761{_}INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}7762{_}of cold roast beef, 2 small onions, 1 large carrot or two small ones, 1 turnip, a small bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 3 tablespoonfuls of ale, crust or mashed potatoes.
10136-8{_}7763{_}_Mode_.--Cut the beef in slices, allowing a small amount of fat to each slice; place a layer of this in the bottom of a pie-dish, with a portion of the onions, carrots, and turnips, which must be sliced; mince the herbs, strew them over the meat, and season with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7764{_}Then put another layer of meat, vegetables, and seasoning; and proceed in this manner until all the ingredients are used.
10136-8{_}7765{_}Pour in the gravy and ale (water may be substituted for the former, but it is not so nice), cover with a crust or mashed potatoes, and bake for 1/2 hour, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}7766{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7767{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.
10136-8{_}7768{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}7769{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}7770{_}_Note_.--It is as well to parboil the carrots and turnips before adding them to the meat, and to use some of the liquor in which they were boiled as a substitute for gravy; that is to say, when there is no gravy at hand.
10136-8{_}7771{_}Be particular to cut the onions in very _thin_ slices.
10136-8{_}7772{_}II.
10136-8{_}7773{_}599.
10136-8{_}7774{_}INGREDIENTS.--Slices of cold roast beef, salt and pepper to taste, 1 sliced onion, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, 5 or 6 tablespoonfuls of gravy or sauce of any kind, mashed potatoes.
10136-8{_}7775{_}_Mode_.--Butter the sides of a deep dish, and spread mashed potatoes over the bottom of it; on this place layers of beef in thin slices (this may be minced if there is not sufficient beef to cut into slices), well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a very little onion end herbs, which should be previously fried of a nice brown; then put another layer of mashed potatoes, and beef, and other ingredients, as before; pour in the gravy or sauce, cover the whole with another layer of potatoes, and bake for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7776{_}This may be served in the dish, or turned out.
10136-8{_}7777{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7778{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold beef, 6d.
10136-8{_}7779{_}_Sufficient_.--A large pie-dish full for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}7780{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}7781{_}BEEF.--The quality of beef depends on various circumstances;     such as the age, the sex, the breed of the animal, and also on     the food upon which it has been raised.
10136-8{_}7782{_}Bull beef is, in     general, dry and tough, and by no means possessed of an     agreeable flavour; whilst the flesh of the ox is not only highly     nourishing and digestible, but, if not too old, extremely     agreeable.
10136-8{_}7783{_}The flesh of the cow is, also, nourishing, but it is     not so agreeable as that of the ox, although that of a heifer is     held in high estimation.
10136-8{_}7784{_}The flesh of the smaller breeds is much     sweeter than that of the larger, which is best when the animal     is about seven years old.
10136-8{_}7785{_}That of the smaller breeds is best at     about five years, and that of the cow can hardly be eaten too     young.
10136-8{_}7786{_}BAKED BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.
10136-8{_}7787{_}600.
10136-8{_}7788{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 oz.
10136-8{_}7789{_}of flour, 2 eggs, not quite 1 pint of milk, salt to taste, 1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}7790{_}of rump-steaks, 1 kidney, pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7791{_}_Mode_.--Cut the steaks into nice square pieces, with a small quantity of fat, and the kidney divide into small pieces.
10136-8{_}7792{_}Make a batter of flour, eggs, and milk in the above proportion; lay a little of it at the bottom of a pie-dish; then put in the steaks and kidney, which should be well seasoned with pepper and salt, and pour over the remainder of the batter, and bake for 1-1/2 hour in a brisk but not fierce oven.
10136-8{_}7793{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7794{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}7795{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}7796{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}7798{_}(_Economical_.)
10136-8{_}7799{_}601.
10136-8{_}7800{_}INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}7801{_}of clod or sticking of beef, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}7802{_}of clarified dripping, 1 large onion, flour, 2 quarts of water, 12 berries of allspice, 2 bay-leaves, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, salt to taste.
10136-8{_}7803{_}_Mode_.--Cut the beef into small pieces, and roll them in flour; put the dripping into a stewpan with the onion, which should be sliced thin.
10136-8{_}7804{_}Let it get quite hot; lay in the pieces of beef, and stir them well about.
10136-8{_}7805{_}When nicely browned all over, add _by degrees_ boiling water in the above proportion, and, as the water is added, keep the whole well stirred.
10136-8{_}7806{_}Put in the spice, bay-leaves, and seasoning, cover the stewpan closely, and set it by the side of the fire to stew very _gently_, till the meat becomes quite tender, which will be in about 3 hours, when it will be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}7807{_}Remove the bay-leaves before it is sent to table.
10136-8{_}7808{_}_Time_.--3 hours.
10136-8{_}7809{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}7810{_}3d.
10136-8{_}7811{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}7812{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}7813{_}BEEF A LA MODE.
10136-8{_}7814{_}602.
10136-8{_}7815{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 or 7 lbs.
10136-8{_}7816{_}of the thick flank of beef, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 teacupful of vinegar, black pepper, allspice, 2 cloves well mixed and finely pounded, making altogether 1 heaped teaspoonful; salt to taste, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, all finely minced and well mixed; 3 onions, 2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of celery, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1 glass of port wine.
10136-8{_}7817{_}_Mode_.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown, and cut up the other vegetables in small pieces, and prepare the beef for stewing in the following manner:--Choose a fine piece of beef, cut the bacon into long slices, about an inch in thickness, dip them into vinegar, and then into a little of the above seasoning of spice, &c., mixed with the same quantity of minced herbs.
10136-8{_}7818{_}With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to let in the bacon; then rub the beef over with the remainder of the seasoning and herbs, and bind it up in a nice shape with tape.
10136-8{_}7819{_}Have ready a well-tinned stewpan (it should not be much larger than the piece of meat you are cooking), into which put the beef, with the vegetables, vinegar, and water.
10136-8{_}7820{_}Let it simmer _very gently_ for 5 hours, or rather longer, should the meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or twice.
10136-8{_}7821{_}When ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put it on a hot dish.
10136-8{_}7822{_}Skim off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the port wine, just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and it is ready to serve.
10136-8{_}7823{_}Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast, or the meat will be tough and tasteless; it should only just bubble.
10136-8{_}7824{_}When convenient, all kinds of stews, &c., should be cooked on a hot-plate, as the process is so much more gradual than on an open fire.
10136-8{_}7825{_}_Time_.--5 hours, or rather more.
10136-8{_}7826{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}7827{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7828{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}7829{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable for a winter dish.
10136-8{_}7830{_}GOOD MEAT.--The lyer of meat when freshly killed, and the     animal, when slaughtered, being in a state of perfect health,     adheres firmly to the bones.
10136-8{_}7831{_}Beef of the best quality is of a     deep-red colour; and when the animal has approached maturity,     and been well fed, the lean is intermixed with fat, giving it     the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed.
10136-8{_}7832{_}It is also     full of juice, which resembles in colour claret wine.
10136-8{_}7833{_}The fat of     the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency, of a colour     resembling that of the finest grass butter; bright in     appearance, neither greasy nor friable to the touch, but     moderately unctuous, in a medium degree between the     last-mentioned properties.
10136-8{_}7834{_}BEEF-STEAKS AND OYSTER SAUCE.
10136-8{_}7835{_}603.
10136-8{_}7836{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, ingredients for oyster sauce (see No.
10136-8{_}7837{_}492), 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}7838{_}of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7839{_}_Mode_.--Make the oyster sauce by recipe No.
10136-8{_}7840{_}492, and when that is ready, put it by the side of the fire, but do not let it keep boiling.
10136-8{_}7841{_}Have the steaks cut of an equal thickness, broil them over a very clear fire, turning them often, that the gravy may not escape.
10136-8{_}7842{_}In about 8 minutes they will be done, then put them on a very hot dish; smother with the oyster sauce, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}7843{_}Serve quickly.
10136-8{_}7844{_}_Time_.--About 8 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the steak.
10136-8{_}7845{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}7846{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7847{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}7848{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}7849{_}BEEF-STEAK PIE.
10136-8{_}7850{_}604.
10136-8{_}7851{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs.
10136-8{_}7852{_}of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, and black pepper, crust, water, the yolk of an egg.
10136-8{_}7853{_}_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a few days, that they may be tender, and be particular that every portion is perfectly sweet.
10136-8{_}7854{_}Cut the steaks into pieces about 3 inches long and 2 wide, allowing a _small_ piece of fat to each piece of lean, and arrange the meat in layers in a pie-dish.
10136-8{_}7855{_}Between each layer sprinkle a seasoning of salt, pepper, and, when liked, a few grains of cayenne.
10136-8{_}7856{_}Fill the dish sufficiently with meat to support the crust, and to give it a nice raised appearance when baked, and not to look flat and hollow.
10136-8{_}7857{_}Pour in sufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with paste (see Pastry); brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover; slightly press down the edges with the thumb, and trim off close to the dish.
10136-8{_}7858{_}Ornament the pie with leaves, or pieces of paste cut in any shape that fancy may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg; make a hole in the top of the crust, and bake in a hot oven for about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7859{_}_Time_.--In a hot oven, 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}7860{_}_Average cost_, for this size, 3s 6d.
10136-8{_}7861{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}7862{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}7863{_}Note.--Beef-steak pies may be flavoured in various ways, with oysters and their liquor, mushrooms, minced onions, &c. For family pies, suet may be used instead of butter or lard for the crust, and clarified beef-dripping answers very well where economy is an object.
10136-8{_}7864{_}Pieces of underdone roast or boiled meat may in pies be used very advantageously; but always remove the bone from pie-meat, unless it be chicken or game.
10136-8{_}7865{_}We have directed that the meat shall be cut smaller than is usually the case; for on trial we have found it much more tender, more easily helped, and with more gravy, than when put into the dish in one or two large steaks.
10136-8{_}7866{_}[Illustration: SHERRY PUDDING DISH.]
10136-8{_}7867{_}BEEF-STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING.
10136-8{_}7868{_}605.
10136-8{_}7869{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}7870{_}of rump-steak, 2 kidneys, seasoning to taste of salt and black pepper, suet crust made with milk (see Pastry), in the proportion of 6 oz.
10136-8{_}7871{_}of suet to each 1 lb.
10136-8{_}7872{_}of flour.
10136-8{_}7873{_}_Mode_.--Procure some tender rump steak (that which has been hung a little time), and divide it into pieces about an inch square, and cut each kidney into 8 pieces.
10136-8{_}7874{_}Line the dish (of which we have given an engraving) with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion, leaving a small piece of crust to overlap the edge.
10136-8{_}7875{_}Then cover the bottom with a portion of the steak and a few pieces of kidney; season with salt and pepper (some add a little flour to thicken the gravy, but it is not necessary), and then add another layer of steak, kidney, and seasoning.
10136-8{_}7876{_}Proceed in this manner till the dish is full, when pour in sufficient water to come within 2 inches of the top of the basin.
10136-8{_}7877{_}Moisten the edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two crusts together, that the gravy may not escape, and turn up the overhanging paste.
10136-8{_}7878{_}Wring out a cloth in hot water, flour it, and tie up the pudding; put it into boiling water, and let it boil for at least 4 hours.
10136-8{_}7879{_}If the water diminishes, always replenish with some, hot in a jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and not allowed to stop boiling.
10136-8{_}7880{_}When the cloth is removed, cut out a round piece in the top of the crust, to prevent the pudding bursting, and send it to table in the basin, either in an ornamental dish, or with a napkin pinned round it.
10136-8{_}7881{_}Serve quickly.
10136-8{_}7882{_}_Time_.--For a pudding with 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}7883{_}of steak and 2 kidneys allow 4 hours.
10136-8{_}7884{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}7885{_}8d.
10136-8{_}7886{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}7887{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable in winter.
10136-8{_}7888{_}Note.--Beef-steak pudding may be very much enriched by adding a few oysters or mushrooms.
10136-8{_}7889{_}The above recipe was contributed to this work by a Sussex lady, in which county the inhabitants are noted for their savoury puddings.
10136-8{_}7890{_}It differs from the general way of making them, as the meat is cut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped: on trial, this pudding will be found far nicer, and more full of gravy, than when laid in large pieces in the dish.
10136-8{_}7891{_}BAD MEAT.
10136-8{_}7892{_}In the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering     acute inflammation or fever, the hollow fibres, or capillaries,     as they are called, which form the substance of the lyer, are     filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid, which,     from its impurity, gives the lyer a dark colour, and produces a     tendency to rapid putrefaction.
10136-8{_}7893{_}In a more advanced stage of such     disease, serous, and sometimes purulent matter, is formed in the     cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh; and when such     is the case, nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable     carrion.
10136-8{_}7894{_}In the flesh of animals killed whilst under the     influence of any disease of an emaciating effect, the lyer     adheres but slightly to the bones, with its fibres contracted     and dry; and the little fat that there may be is friable, and     shrunk within its integuments.
10136-8{_}7895{_}The flesh of animals slaughtered     whilst under considerable depression of vital energy (as from     previous bleeding) has a diminished tendency to stiffen after     death, the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to     the degree of depression.
10136-8{_}7896{_}It presents, also, an unnatural blue     or pallid appearance, has a faint and slightly sour smell, and     soon becomes putrid.
10136-8{_}7897{_}When an animal has died otherwise than by     slaughtering, its flesh is flaccid and clammy, emits a peculiar     faint and disagreeable smell, and, it need scarcely be added,     spontaneous decomposition proceeds very rapidly.
10136-8{_}7898{_}BEEF-STEAKS WITH FRIED POTATOES, or BIFTEK AUX POMMES-DE-TERRE (a la mode Francaise).
10136-8{_}7899{_}606.
10136-8{_}7900{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}7901{_}of steak, 8 potatoes, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}7902{_}of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced herbs.
10136-8{_}7903{_}_Mode_.--Put the butter into a frying or _sauté_ pan, set it over the fire, and let it get very hot; peel, and cut the potatoes into long thin slices; put them into the hot butter, and fry them till of a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}7904{_}Now broil the steaks over a bright clear fire, turning them frequently, that every part may be equally done: as they should not be thick, 5 minutes will broil them.
10136-8{_}7905{_}Put the herbs and seasoning in the butter the potatoes were fried in, pour it under the steak, and place the fried potatoes round, as a garnish.
10136-8{_}7906{_}To have this dish in perfection, a portion of the fillet of the sirloin should be used, as the meat is generally so much more tender than that of the rump, and the steaks should be cut about 1/3 of an inch in thickness.
10136-8{_}7907{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to broil the steaks, and about the same time to fry the potatoes.
10136-8{_}7908{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}7909{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7910{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}7911{_}_Seasonable_ all the year; but not so good in warm weather, as the meat cannot hang to get tender.
10136-8{_}7912{_}[Illustration: AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.]
10136-8{_}7913{_}BOILED AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}7914{_}607.
10136-8{_}7915{_}INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.
10136-8{_}7916{_}_Mode_.--After this joint has been in salt 5 or 6 days, it will be ready for use, and will not take so long boiling: as a round, for it is not so solid.
10136-8{_}7917{_}Wash the meat, and, if too salt, soak it for a few hours, changing the water once or twice, till the required freshness is obtained.
10136-8{_}7918{_}Put into a saucepan, or boiling-pot, sufficient water to cover the meat; set it over the fire, and when it boils, plunge in the joint (see No.
10136-8{_}7919{_}557), and let it boil up quickly.
10136-8{_}7920{_}Now draw the pot to the side of the fire, and let the process be very gradual, as the water must only simmer, or the meat will be hard and tough.
10136-8{_}7921{_}Carefully remove the scum from the surface of the water, and continue doing this for a few minutes after it first boils.
10136-8{_}7922{_}Carrots and turnips are served with this dish, and sometimes suet dumplings, which may be boiled with the beef.
10136-8{_}7923{_}Garnish with a few of the carrots and turnips, and serve the remainder in a vegetable-dish.
10136-8{_}7924{_}_Time_.--An aitch-bone of 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours after the water boils; one of 20 lbs., 4 hours.
10136-8{_}7925{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}7926{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7927{_}_Sufficient_.--10 lbs.
10136-8{_}7928{_}for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}7929{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from September to March.
10136-8{_}7930{_}_Note_.--The liquor in which the meat has been boiled may be easily converted into a very excellent pea-soup.
10136-8{_}7931{_}It will require very few vegetables, as it will be impregnated with the flavour of those boiled with the meat.
10136-8{_}7932{_}THE ACTION OF SALT ON MEAT.--The manner in which salt acts in     preserving meat is not difficult to understand.
10136-8{_}7933{_}By its strong     affinity, it, in the first place, extracts the juices from the     substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated     solution with the water contained in the juice, and the meat     then absorbs the saturated brine in place of the juice extracted     by the salt.
10136-8{_}7934{_}In this way, matter incapable of putrefaction takes     the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable.
10136-8{_}7935{_}Such, however, is not the only office of salt as a means of     preserving meat; it acts also by its astringency in contracting     the fibres of the muscles, and so excludes the action of air on     the interior of the substance of the meat.
10136-8{_}7936{_}The last-mentioned     operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution     of the volume of meat to which it is applied.
10136-8{_}7937{_}The astringent     action of _saltpetre_ on meat is much greater than that of salt,     and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard; but,     in small quantities, it considerably assists the antiseptic     action of salt, and also prevents the destruction of the florid     colour of meat, which is caused by the application of salt.
10136-8{_}7938{_}Thus, it will be perceived, from the foregoing statement, that     the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes, in a     considerable degree, the nutritive, and, to some extent, the     wholesome qualities of meat; and, therefore, in their use, the     quantity applied should be as small as possible, consistent with     the perfect preservation of the meat.
10136-8{_}7939{_}BOILED ROUND OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}7940{_}608.
10136-8{_}7941{_}INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.
10136-8{_}7942{_}_Mode_.--As a whole round of beef, generally speaking, is too large for small families, and very seldom required, we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the silver side of the round.
10136-8{_}7943{_}Take from 12 to 16 lbs., after it has been in salt about 10 days; just wash off the salt, skewer it up in a nice round-looking form, and bind it with tape to keep the skewers in their places.
10136-8{_}7944{_}Put it in a saucepan of boiling water, as in the preceding recipe, set it upon a good fire, and when it begins to boil, carefully remove all scum from the surface, as, if this is not attended to, it sinks on to the meat, and when brought to table, presents a very unsightly appearance.
10136-8{_}7945{_}When it is well skimmed, draw the pot to the corner of the fire, and let it simmer very gently until done.
10136-8{_}7946{_}Remove the tape and skewers, which should be replaced by a silver one; pour over a little of the pot-liquor, and garnish with carrots.
10136-8{_}7947{_}(_See_ coloured plate 2.)
10136-8{_}7948{_}Carrots, turnips, parsnips, and sometimes suet dumplings, accompany this dish; and these may all be boiled with the beef.
10136-8{_}7949{_}The pot-liquor should be saved, and converted into pea-soup; and the outside slices, which are generally hard, and of an uninviting appearance, may be out off before being sent to table, and potted.
10136-8{_}7950{_}These make an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon table.
10136-8{_}7951{_}_Time_.--Part of a round of beef weighing 12 lbs., about 3 hours after the water boils.
10136-8{_}7952{_}_Average cost_, 8d.
10136-8{_}7953{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7954{_}_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.
10136-8{_}7955{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable for winter.
10136-8{_}7956{_}609.
10136-8{_}7957{_}SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PRESERVING THE GRAVY IN SALT MEAT, WHEN IT IS TO BE SERVED COLD.--Fill two tubs with cold water, into which throw a few pounds of rough ice; and when the meat is done, put it into one of the tubs of ice-water; let it remain 1 minute, when take out, and put it into the other tub.
10136-8{_}7958{_}Fill the first tub again with water, and continue this process for about 20 minutes; then set it upon a dish, and let it remain until quite cold.
10136-8{_}7959{_}When cut, the fat will be as white as possible, besides having saved the whole, of the gravy.
10136-8{_}7960{_}If there is no ice, spring water will answer the same purpose, but will require to be more frequently changed.
10136-8{_}7961{_}_Note_.--The BRISKET and RUMP may be boiled by the above recipe; of course allowing more or less time, according to the size of the joint.
10136-8{_}7962{_}BEEF CAKE.
10136-8{_}7963{_}610.
10136-8{_}7964{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef; to each pound of cold meat allow 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}7965{_}of bacon or ham; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt, 1 small bunch of minced savoury herbs, 1 or 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}7966{_}_Mode_.--Mince the beef very finely (if underdone it will be better), add to it the bacon, which must also be chopped very small, and mix well together.
10136-8{_}7967{_}Season, stir in the herbs, and bind with an egg, or 2 should 1 not be sufficient.
10136-8{_}7968{_}Make it into small square cakes, about 1/2 inch thick, fry them in hot dripping, and serve in a dish with good gravy poured round them.
10136-8{_}7969{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}7970{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.
10136-8{_}7971{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}7972{_}BROILED BEEF-STEAKS or RUMP-STEAKS.
10136-8{_}7973{_}611.
10136-8{_}7974{_}INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of good mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce.
10136-8{_}7975{_}_Mode_.--As the success of a good broil so much depends on the state of the fire, see that it is bright and clear, and perfectly free from smoke, and do not add any fresh fuel just before you require to use the gridiron.
10136-8{_}7976{_}Sprinkle a little salt over the fire, put on the gridiron for a few minutes, to get thoroughly hot through; rub it with a piece of fresh, suet, to prevent the meat from sticking, and lay on the steaks, which should be cut of an equal thickness, about 3/4 of an inch, or rather thinner, and level them by beating them as _little_ as possible with a rolling-pin.
10136-8{_}7977{_}Turn them frequently with steak-tongs (if these are not at hand, stick a fork in the edge of the fat, that no gravy escapes), and in from 8 to 10 minutes they will be done.
10136-8{_}7978{_}Have ready a very hot dish, into which put the ketchup, and, when liked, a little minced shalot; dish up the steaks, rub them over with butter, and season with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7979{_}The exact time for broiling steaks must be determined by taste, whether they are liked underdone or well done; more than from 8 to 10 minutes for a steak 3/4 inch in thickness, we think, would spoil and dry up the juices of the meat.
10136-8{_}7980{_}Great expedition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table; and, to have them in perfection, they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for dinner has been dished up, as their excellence entirely depends on their being served very hot.
10136-8{_}7981{_}Garnish with scraped horseradish, or slices of cucumber.
10136-8{_}7982{_}Oyster, tomato, onion, and many other sauces, are frequent accompaniments to rump-steak, but true lovers of this English dish generally reject all additions but pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}7983{_}_Time_.--8 to 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}7984{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}7985{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}7986{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}7987{_}to each person; if the party consist entirely of gentlemen, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}7988{_}will not be too much.
10136-8{_}7989{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good in the height of summer, as the meat cannot hang long enough to be tender.
10136-8{_}7990{_}DIFFERENT SEASONS FOR BEEF.--We have already stated (see No.
10136-8{_}7991{_}593) that the Scots breed of oxen, like the South-down in     mutton, stands first in excellence.
10136-8{_}7992{_}It should be borne in mind,     however, that each county has its particular season, and that     the London and other large markets are always supplied by those     counties whose meat, from local circumstances, is in the best     condition at the time.
10136-8{_}7993{_}Thus, the season in Norfolk, from which     the Scots come (these being the principal oxen bred by the     Norfolk and Suffolk graziers), commences about Christmas and     terminates about June, when this breed begins to fall off, their     place being taken by grass-fed oxen.
10136-8{_}7994{_}A large quantity of most     excellent meat is sent to the "dead markets" from Scotland, and     some of the best London butchers are supplied from this source.

10136-8{_}8000{_}_Mode_.--Wipe the mushrooms free from grit with a piece of flannel, and salt; put them in a stewpan with the butter, seasoning, and ketchup; stir over the fire until the mushrooms are quite done, when pour it in the middle of mashed potatoes, browned.
10136-8{_}8001{_}Then place round the potatoes slices of cold roast beef, nicely broiled, over a clear fire.
10136-8{_}8002{_}In making the mushroom sauce, the ketchup may be dispensed with, if there is sufficient gravy.

10136-8{_}8019{_}_Mode_.--Separate the bones, taking care that the meat on them is not too thick in any part; sprinkle them well with the above seasoning, and broil over a very clear fire.
10136-8{_}8020{_}When nicely browned they are done; but do not allow them to blacken.

10136-8{_}8027{_}Fasten it in, by means of a needle and coarse thread; tie the heart up in paper, and set it before a good fire, being very particular to keep it well basted, or it will eat dry, there being very little of its own fat.
10136-8{_}8028{_}Two or three minutes before serving, remove the paper, baste well, and serve with good gravy and red-currant jelly or melted butter.

10136-8{_}8091{_}INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of tolerably lean cold roast or boiled beef, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}8092{_}of butter, 2 onions, 1 wineglassful of beer, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder.
10136-8{_}8093{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the beef into pieces about 1 inch square, put the butter into a stewpan with the onions sliced, and fry them of a lightly-brown colour.
10136-8{_}8094{_}Add all the other ingredients, and stir gently over a brisk fire for about 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}8095{_}Should this be thought too dry, more beer, or a spoonful or two of gravy or water, may be added; but a good curry should not be very thin.
10136-8{_}8096{_}Place it in a deep dish, with an edging of dry boiled rice, in the same manner as for other curries.
10136-8{_}8097{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.

10136-8{_}8099{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}8100{_}TO CLARIFY BEEF DRIPPING.
10136-8{_}8101{_}I.
10136-8{_}8102{_}621.
10136-8{_}8103{_}Good and fresh dripping answers very well for basting everything except game and poultry, and, when well clarified, serves for frying nearly as well as lard; it should be kept in a cool place, and will remain good some time.
10136-8{_}8104{_}To clarify it, put the dripping into a basin, pour over it boiling water, and keep stirring the whole to wash away the impurities.
10136-8{_}8105{_}Let it stand to cool, when the water and dirty sediment will settle at the bottom of the basin.
10136-8{_}8106{_}Remove the dripping, and put it away in jars or basins for use.
10136-8{_}8107{_}ANOTHER WAY.
10136-8{_}8108{_}622.
10136-8{_}8109{_}Put the dripping into a clean saucepan, and let it boil for a few minutes over a slow fire, and be careful to skim it well.
10136-8{_}8110{_}Let it stand to cool a little, then strain it through a piece of muslin into jars for use.
10136-8{_}8111{_}Beef dripping is preferable to any other for cooking purposes, as, with mutton dripping, there is liable to be a tallowy taste and smell.
10136-8{_}8112{_}ROAST FILLET OF BEEF (Larded).
10136-8{_}8113{_}623.

10136-8{_}8129{_}105, or water, 1 glass of sherry, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 2 shalots, bacon.
10136-8{_}8130{_}_Mode_.--Cut some bacon into thin strips, and sprinkle over them a seasoning of pepper and salt, mixed with cloves, mace, and allspice, well pounded.
10136-8{_}8131{_}Lard the beef with these, put it into a stewpan with the stock or water, sherry, herbs, shalots, 2 cloves, and more pepper and salt.

10136-8{_}8133{_}Set it on the fire, and boil, till it becomes a glaze.
10136-8{_}8134{_}Glaze the larded side of the beef with this, and serve on sorrel sauce, which is made as follows:--Wash and pick some sorrel, and put it into a stewpan with only the water that hangs about it.
10136-8{_}8135{_}Keep stirring, to prevent its burning, and when done, lay it in a sieve to drain.
10136-8{_}8136{_}Chop it, and stew it with a small piece of butter and 4 or 6 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, for an hour, and rub it through a tammy.
10136-8{_}8137{_}If too acid, add a little sugar; and a little cabbage-lettuce boiled with the sorrel will be found an improvement.
10136-8{_}8138{_}_Time_.--2 hours to gently stew the meat.

10136-8{_}8145{_}of butter, mashed potatoes.
10136-8{_}8146{_}_Mode_.--Cut any part of cold salt beef into thin slices, fry them gently in butter, and season with a little pepper.
10136-8{_}8147{_}Have ready some very hot mashed potatoes, lay the slices of beef on them, and garnish with 3 or 4 pickled gherkins.
10136-8{_}8148{_}Cold salt beef, warmed in a little liquor from mixed pickle, drained, and served as above, will be found good.
10136-8{_}8149{_}_Time_.--About 5 minutes.

10136-8{_}8153{_}626.
10136-8{_}8154{_}INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, butter or clarified dripping.
10136-8{_}8155{_}_Mode_.
10136-8{_}8156{_}Although broiling is a far superior method of cooking steaks to frying them, yet, when the cook is not very expert, the latter mode may be adopted; and, when properly done, the dish may really look very inviting, and the flavour be good.
10136-8{_}8157{_}The steaks should be cut rather thinner than for broiling, and with a small quantity of fat to each.
10136-8{_}8158{_}Put some butter or clarified dripping into a frying-pan; let it get quite hot, then lay in the steaks.
10136-8{_}8159{_}Turn them frequently until done, which will be in about 8 minutes, or rather more, should the steaks be very thick.
10136-8{_}8160{_}Serve on a very hot dish, in which put a small piece of butter and a tablespoonful of ketchup, and season with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}8161{_}They should be sent to table quickly, as, when cold, the steaks are entirely spoiled.
10136-8{_}8162{_}_Time_.--8 minutes for a medium-sized steak, rather longer for a very thick one.
10136-8{_}8163{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}8164{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8165{_}_Seasonable all the year, but not good in summer, as the meat cannot hang to get tender._  _Note_.--Where much gravy is liked, make it in the following manner:--As soon as the steaks are done, dish them, pour a little boiling water into the frying-pan, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, a small piece of butter, and a tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}8166{_}Hold the pan over the fire for a minute or two, just let the gravy simmer, then pour on the steak, and serve.
10136-8{_}8167{_}A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8168{_}The following is translated from     a celebrated modern French work, the production of one who in     Paris enjoys a great reputation as cook and chemist:--The flesh     of the ox, to be in the best condition, should be taken from an     animal of from four to six years old, and neither too fat nor     too lean.
10136-8{_}8169{_}This meat, which possesses in the highest degree the     most nutritive qualities, is generally easily digested; stock is     made from it, and it is eaten boiled, broiled, roasted, stewed,     braised, and in a hundred other different ways.
10136-8{_}8170{_}Beef is the     foundation of stock, gravies, braises, &c.; its nutritious and     succulent gravy gives body and flavour to numberless ragoûts.
10136-8{_}8171{_}It     is an exhaustless mine in the hands of a skilful artist, and is     truly the king of the kitchen.
10136-8{_}8172{_}Without it, no soup, no gravy;     and its absence would produce almost a famine in the civilized     world!
10136-8{_}8173{_}BEEF FRITTERS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}8174{_}627.
10136-8{_}8175{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef, pepper and salt to taste, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}8176{_}of flour, 1/2 pint of water, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}8177{_}of butter, the whites of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}8178{_}_Mode_.--Mix very smoothly, and by degrees, the flour with the above proportion of water; stir in 2 oz.
10136-8{_}8179{_}of butter, which must be melted, but not oiled, and, just before it is to be used, add the whites of two well-whisked eggs.
10136-8{_}8180{_}Should the batter be too thick, more water must be added.
10136-8{_}8181{_}Pare down the cold beef into thin shreds, season with pepper and salt, and mix it with the batter.
10136-8{_}8182{_}Drop a small quantity at a time into a pan of boiling lard, and fry from 7 to 10 minutes, according to the size.
10136-8{_}8183{_}When done on one side, turn and brown them on the other.
10136-8{_}8184{_}Let them dry for a minute or two before the fire, and serve on a folded napkin.
10136-8{_}8185{_}A small quantity of finely-minced onions, mixed with the batter, is an improvement.
10136-8{_}8186{_}_Time_.--From 7 to 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}8187{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.
10136-8{_}8188{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8189{_}HASHED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}8190{_}I.
10136-8{_}8191{_}628.
10136-8{_}8192{_}INGREDIENTS.--Gravy saved from the meat, 1 teaspoonful of tomato sauce, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of good mushroom ketchup, 1/2 glass of port wine or strong ale, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour to thicken, 1 onion finely minced, a few slices of cold roast beef.
10136-8{_}8193{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients but the beef into a stewpan with whatever gravy may have been saved from the meat the day it was roasted; let these simmer gently for 10 minutes, then take the stewpan off the fire; let the gravy cool, and skim off the fat.
10136-8{_}8194{_}Cut the beef into thin slices, dredge them with flour, and lay them in the gravy; let the whole simmer gently for 5 minutes, but not boil, or the meat will be tough and hard.
10136-8{_}8195{_}Serve very hot, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}8196{_}_Time_.--20 minutes.
10136-8{_}8197{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 4d.
10136-8{_}8198{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}8202{_}_Mode_.--Take off all the meat from the bones of ribs or sirloin of beef; remove the outside brown and gristle; place the meat on one side, and well stew the bones and pieces, with the above ingredients, for about 2 hours, till it becomes a strong gravy, and is reduced to rather more than 1/2 pint; strain this, thicken with a teaspoonful of flour, and let the gravy cool; skim off all the fat; lay in the meat, let it get hot through, but do not allow it to boil, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}8203{_}The gravy may be flavoured as in the preceding recipe.
10136-8{_}8204{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.
10136-8{_}8205{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 2d.
10136-8{_}8206{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8207{_}_Note_.--Either of the above recipes may be served in walls of mashed potatoes browned; in which case the sippets should be omitted.
10136-8{_}8208{_}Be careful that hashed meat does not boil, or it will become tough.
10136-8{_}8209{_}TO PREPARE HUNG BEEF.
10136-8{_}8210{_}630.
10136-8{_}8211{_}This is preserved by salting and drying, either with or without smoke.
10136-8{_}8212{_}Hang up the beef 3 or 4 days, till it becomes tender, but take care it does not begin to spoil; then salt it in the usual way, either by dry-salting or by brine, with bay-salt, brown sugar, saltpetre, and a little pepper and allspice; afterwards roll it tight in a cloth, and hang it up in a warm, but not hot place, for a fortnight or more, till it is sufficiently hard.
10136-8{_}8213{_}If required to have a little of the smoky flavour, it may be hung for some time in a chimney-corner, or smoked in any other way: it will keep a long time.
10136-8{_}8214{_}HUNTER'S BEEF.
10136-8{_}8215{_}631.
10136-8{_}8216{_}INGREDIENTS.--For a round of beef weighing 25 lbs.
10136-8{_}8217{_}allow 3 oz.
10136-8{_}8218{_}of saltpetre, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}8219{_}of coarse sugar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}8220{_}of cloves, 1 grated nutmeg, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}8221{_}of allspice, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}8222{_}of salt, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}8223{_}bay-salt.
10136-8{_}8224{_}_Mode_.--Let the beef hang for 2 or 3 days, and remove the bone.
10136-8{_}8225{_}Pound spices, salt, &c. in the above proportion, and let them be reduced to the finest powder.
10136-8{_}8226{_}Put the beef into a pan, rub all the ingredients well into it, and turn and rub it every day for rather more than a fortnight.
10136-8{_}8227{_}When it has been sufficiently long in pickle, wash the meat, bind it up securely with tape, and put it into a pan with 1/2 pint of water at the bottom; mince some suet, cover the top of the meat with it, and over the pan put a common crust of flour and water; bake for 6 hours, and, when cold, remove the paste.
10136-8{_}8228{_}Save the gravy that flows from it, as it adds greatly to the flavour of hashes, stews, &c. The beef may be glazed and garnished with meat jelly.
10136-8{_}8229{_}_Time_.--6 hours.
10136-8{_}8230{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}8231{_}_Note_.--In salting or pickling beef or pork for family consumption, it not being generally required to be kept for a great length of time, a less quantity of salt and a larger quantity of other matters more adapted to retain mellowness in meat, may be employed, which could not be adopted by the curer of the immense quantities of meat required to be preserved for victualling the shipping of this maritime country.
10136-8{_}8232{_}Sugar, which is well known to possess the preserving principle in a very great degree, without the pungency and astringency of salt, may be, and is, very generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption.
10136-8{_}8233{_}Although it acts without corrugating or contracting the fibres of meat, as is the case in the action of salt, and, therefore, does not impair its mellowness, yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative effect, without the addition of other antiseptics, would impart a flavour not agreeable to the taste of many persons.
10136-8{_}8234{_}It may be used, however, together with salt, with the greatest advantage in imparting mildness and mellowness to cured meat, in a proportion of about one part by weight to four of the mixture; and, perhaps, now that sugar is so much lower in price than it was in former years, one of the obstructions to its more frequent use is removed.
10136-8{_}8235{_}TO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY.
10136-8{_}8236{_}I.
10136-8{_}8237{_}632.

10136-8{_}8239{_}_Mode_.--Cut the kidneys into neat slices, put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours, and change the water 2 or 3 times; then put them on a clean cloth to dry the water from them, and lay them in a frying-pan with some clarified butter, and fry them of a nice brown; season each side with pepper and salt, put them round the dish, and the gravy in the middle.
10136-8{_}8240{_}Before pouring the gravy in the dish, add the lemon-juice and sugar.
10136-8{_}8241{_}_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}8242{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}8243{_}each.
10136-8{_}8244{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}8246{_}633.
10136-8{_}8247{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 kidney, 1 dessertspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, salt and pepper to taste, 1/4 pint of gravy, No.
10136-8{_}8248{_}438, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry.
10136-8{_}8249{_}_Mode_.--Take off a little of the kidney fat, mince it very fine, and put it in a frying-pan; slice the kidney, sprinkle over it parsley and shalots in the above proportion, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and fry it of a nice brown.
10136-8{_}8250{_}When it is done enough, dredge over a little flour, and pour in the gravy and sherry.
10136-8{_}8251{_}Let it just simmer, but not boil any more, or the kidney would harden; serve very hot, and garnish with croûtons.
10136-8{_}8252{_}Where the flavour of the shalot is disliked, it may be omitted, and a small quantity of savoury herbs substituted for it.
10136-8{_}8253{_}_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the slices.
10136-8{_}8254{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}8255{_}each.
10136-8{_}8256{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.

10136-8{_}8258{_}III.
10136-8{_}8259{_}_A more Simple Method_.
10136-8{_}8260{_}634.
10136-8{_}8261{_}Cut the kidney into thin slices, flour them, and fry of a nice brown.
10136-8{_}8262{_}When done, make a gravy in the pan by pouring away the fat, putting in a small piece of butter, 1/4 pint of boiling water, pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}8263{_}Let the gravy just boil up, pour over the kidney, and serve.
10136-8{_}8264{_}BOILED MARROW-BONES.
10136-8{_}8265{_}635.
10136-8{_}8266{_}INGREDIENTS.--Bones, a small piece of common paste, a floured cloth.
10136-8{_}8267{_}_Mode_.--Have the bones neatly sawed into convenient sizes, and cover the ends with a small piece of common crust, made with flour and water.
10136-8{_}8268{_}Over this tie a floured cloth, and place them upright in a saucepan of boiling water, taking care there is sufficient to cover the bones.
10136-8{_}8269{_}Boil them for 2 hours, remove the cloth and paste, and serve them upright on a napkin with dry toast.
10136-8{_}8270{_}Many persons clear the marrow from the bones after they are cooked, spread it over a slice of toast and add a seasoning of pepper; when served in this manner, it must be very expeditiously sent to table, as it so soon gets cold.
10136-8{_}8271{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}8272{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8273{_}_Note_.--Marrow-bones may be baked after preparing them as in the preceding recipe; they should be laid in a deep dish, and baked for 2 hours.
10136-8{_}8274{_}[Illustration: MARROW-BONES.]
10136-8{_}8275{_}MARROW-BONES.--Bones are formed of a dense cellular tissue of     membranous matter, made stiff and rigid by insoluble earthy     salts; of which, phosphate of lime is the most abundant.
10136-8{_}8276{_}In a     large bone, the insoluble matter is generally deposited in such     a manner as to leave a cavity, into which a fatty substance,     distinguished by the name of marrow, is thrown.
10136-8{_}8277{_}Hollow     cylindrical bones possess the qualities of strength and     lightness in a remarkable degree.
10136-8{_}8278{_}If bones were entirely solid,     they would be unnecessarily heavy; and if their materials were     brought into smaller compass, they would be weaker, because the     strength of a bone is in proportion to the distance at which its     fibres are from the centre.
10136-8{_}8279{_}Some animals, it must, however, be     observed, have no cavities in the centre of their bones; such as     the whale tribe, skate, and turtles.

10136-8{_}8343{_}THE TAILS OF ANIMALS.--In the class Mammalia, the vertebral     column or backbone presents only slight modifications, and     everywhere shows the same characteristics as in man, who stands     at the head of this division of the animal kingdom.
10136-8{_}8344{_}The length     of this column, however, varies much, and the number of     vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform.
10136-8{_}8345{_}These numerical differences principally depend on the unequal     development of the caudal portion, or tail-end, of the column.
10136-8{_}8346{_}Thus, the tail-forming vertebrae sometimes do not exist at     all,--amongst certain bats for example; in other instances we     reckon forty, fifty, and even upwards of sixty of these bones.
10136-8{_}8347{_}Among the greater number of mammals, the tail is of little use     for locomotion, except that it acts in many cases as does the     rudder of a ship, steadying the animal in his rapid movements,     and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly.
10136-8{_}8348{_}Among some     animals, it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression.
10136-8{_}8349{_}Thus, in the kangaroos and jerboas, the tail forms, with the     hind feet, a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its     spring.
10136-8{_}8350{_}With most of the American monkeys it is prehensile, and     serves the animal as a fifth hand to suspend itself from the     branches of trees; and, lastly, among the whales, it grows to an     enormous size, and becomes the principal instrument for     swimming.
10136-8{_}8351{_}A PICKLE FOR TONGUES OR BEEF (Newmarket Recipe).

10136-8{_}8358{_}Let it get cold, then put in the meat, and allow it to remain in the pickle from 8 to 14 days, according to the size.
10136-8{_}8359{_}It will keep good for 6 months if well boiled once a fortnight.
10136-8{_}8360{_}Tongues will take 1 month or 6 weeks to be properly cured; and, in salting meat, beef and tongues should always be put in separate vessels.
10136-8{_}8361{_}_Time_.--A moderate-sized tongue should remain in the pickle about a month, and be turned every day.

10136-8{_}8379{_}II.
10136-8{_}8380{_}643.
10136-8{_}8381{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}8382{_}of butter, cayenne to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace.
10136-8{_}8383{_}_Mode_.--As we have stated in recipe No.
10136-8{_}8384{_}608, the outside slices of boiled beef may, with a little trouble, be converted into a very nice addition to the breakfast-table.
10136-8{_}8385{_}Cut up the meat into small pieces and pound it well, with a little butter, in a mortar; add a seasoning of cayenne and mace, and be very particular that the latter ingredient is reduced to the finest powder.
10136-8{_}8386{_}When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, put it into glass or earthen potting-pots, and pour on the top a coating of clarified butter.
10136-8{_}8387{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8388{_}_Note_.--If cold roast beef is used, remove all pieces of gristle and dry outside pieces, as these do not pound well.
10136-8{_}8389{_}PRESERVED MEATS.--When an organic substance, like the flesh of     animals, is heated to the boiling-point, it loses the property     of passing into a state of fermentation and decay.
10136-8{_}8390{_}Fresh animal     milk, as is well known, coagulates, after having been kept for     two or three days, into a gelatinous mass; but it may be     preserved for an indefinite period, as a perfectly sweet liquid,     if it be heated daily to the boiling-point.
10136-8{_}8391{_}The knowledge of     this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most     important branch of industry,--namely, the preparation of     preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service.
10136-8{_}8392{_}At     Leith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, at Aberdeen, at     Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and in many parts of Germany,     establishments of enormous magnitude exist, in which soup,     vegetables, and viands of every description are prepared, in     such a manner that they retain their freshness for years.
10136-8{_}8393{_}The     prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron     plate, the covers are soldered air-tight, and the canisters     exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four     hours.
10136-8{_}8394{_}The aliments thus acquire a stability, which one may     almost say is eternal; and when a canister is opened, after the     lapse of several years, its contents are found to be unaltered     in taste, colour, and smell.
10136-8{_}8395{_}We are indebted to the French     philosopher Gay-Lussac for this beautiful practical application     of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation.
10136-8{_}8396{_}An exclusive     salt-meat diet is extremely injurious to the health; and, in     former times, thousands of mariners lost their lives for the     want of fresh aliments during long voyages.
10136-8{_}8397{_}We are sorry to say     that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared, and,     though the statement seems incredible, sometimes adulterated.
10136-8{_}8398{_}Dr. Lankester, who has done so much to expose the frauds of     trade, that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor, says     that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food,     shipped as preserved meats.
10136-8{_}8399{_}Surely, as he observes, there ought     to be some superintendent to examine the so-called articles of     food that are taken on board ship, so that the poor men who have     been fighting our battles abroad may run no risk of being     starved or poisoned on their way home.

10136-8{_}8475{_}FRENCH BEEF.--It has been all but universally admitted, that the     beef of France is greatly inferior in quality to that of     England, owing to inferiority of pasturage.
10136-8{_}8476{_}M. Curmer, however,     one of the latest writers on the culinary art, tells us that     this is a vulgar error, and that French beef is far superior to     that of England.
10136-8{_}8477{_}This is mere vaunting on the part of our     neighbours, who seem to want _la gloire_ in everything; and we     should not deign to notice it, if it had occurred in a work of     small pretensions; but M. Curmer's book professes to be a     complete exposition of the scientific principles of cookery, and     holds a high rank in the didactic literature of France.
10136-8{_}8478{_}We half     suspect that M. Curmer obtained his knowledge of English beef in     the same way as did the poor Frenchman, whom the late Mr.     Mathews, the comedian, so humorously described.
10136-8{_}8479{_}Mr. Lewis, in     his "Physiology of Common Life," has thus revived the story of     the beef-eating son of France:--"A Frenchman was one day blandly     remonstrating against the supercilious scorn expressed by     Englishmen for the beef of France, which he, for his part, did     not find so inferior to that of England.
10136-8{_}8480{_}'I have been two times     in England,' he remarked, but I nevère find the bif so supérieur     to ours.
10136-8{_}8481{_}I find it vary conveenient that they bring it you on     leetle pieces of stick, for one penny: but I do not find the bif     supérieur.'
10136-8{_}8482{_}On hearing this, the Englishman, red with     astonishment, exclaimed, 'Good heavens, sir!
10136-8{_}8483{_}you have been     eating cat's meat.'"
10136-8{_}8484{_}No, M. Curmer, we are ready to acknowledge     the superiority of your cookery, but we have long since made up     our minds as to the inferiority of your raw material.

10136-8{_}8488{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}8489{_}of rump-steak, 1 egg, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of stock, No.
10136-8{_}8490{_}105, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, 2 tablespoonfuls of any store sauce, a slight thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}8491{_}_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut rather thin, slightly beat them to make them level, cut them into 6 or 7 pieces, brush over with egg, and sprinkle with herbs, which should be very finely minced; season with pepper and salt, and roll up the pieces tightly, and fasten with a small skewer.
10136-8{_}8492{_}Put the stock in a stewpan that will exactly hold them, for by being pressed together, they will keep their shape better; lay in the rolls of meat, cover them with the bacon, cut in thin slices, and over that put a piece of paper.
10136-8{_}8493{_}Stew them very _gently_ for full 2 hours; for the slower they are done the better.
10136-8{_}8494{_}Take them out, remove the skewers, thicken the gravy with butter and flour, and flavour with any store sauce that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}8495{_}Give one boil, pour over the meat, and serve.
10136-8{_}8496{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}8497{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}8498{_}per pound.
10136-8{_}8499{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}8500{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8501{_}II.
10136-8{_}8502{_}(_Economical_.)
10136-8{_}8503{_}651.
10136-8{_}8504{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of underdone cold roast beef, bread crumbs, 1 shalot finely minced, pepper and salt to taste, gravy made from the beef bones, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}8505{_}_Mode_.--Cut some slices of underdone roast beef about half an inch thick; sprinkle over them some bread crumbs, minced shalot, and a little of the fat and seasoning; roll them, and fasten with a small skewer.
10136-8{_}8506{_}Have ready some gravy made from the beef bones; put in the pieces of meat, and stew them till tender, which will be in about 1-1/4 hour, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}8507{_}Arrange the meat in a dish, thicken and flavour the gravy, and pour it over the meat, when it is ready to serve.
10136-8{_}8508{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}8509{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the beef, 2d.
10136-8{_}8510{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8511{_}BROILED OX-TAIL (an Entree).
10136-8{_}8512{_}652.
10136-8{_}8513{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 tails, 1-1/2 pint of stock, No.
10136-8{_}8514{_}105, salt and cayenne to taste, bread crumbs, 1 egg.
10136-8{_}8515{_}_Mode_.--Joint and cut up the tails into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a stewpan, with the stock, cayenne, and salt, and, if liked very savoury, a bunch of sweet herbs.
10136-8{_}8516{_}Let them simmer gently for about 2-1/2 hours; then take them out, drain them, and let them cool.
10136-8{_}8517{_}Beat an egg upon a plate; dip in each piece of tail, and, afterwards, throw them into a dish of bread crumbs; broil them over a clear fire, until of a brownish colour on both sides, and serve with a good gravy, or any sauce that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}8518{_}_Time_.--About 2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}8519{_}_Average cost_, from 9d.
10136-8{_}8520{_}to 1s.
10136-8{_}8521{_}6d., according to the season.
10136-8{_}8522{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}8523{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8524{_}_Note_.--These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in a brisk oven, after they have been dipped in egg and bread-crumb; and, when brown, they are done.
10136-8{_}8525{_}They must be boiled the same time as for broiling.
10136-8{_}8526{_}STRANGE TAILS.--Naturalists cannot explain the uses of some of     the strange tails borne by animals.
10136-8{_}8527{_}In the Egyptian and Syrian     sheep, for instance, the tail grows so large, that it is not     infrequently supported upon a sort of little cart, in order to     prevent inconvenience to the animal.
10136-8{_}8528{_}Thin monstrous appendage     sometimes attains a weight of seventy, eighty, or even a hundred     pounds.
10136-8{_}8529{_}TO DRESS BEEF PALATES (an Entree).
10136-8{_}8530{_}653.
10136-8{_}8531{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 palates, sufficient gravy to cover them (No.
10136-8{_}8532{_}438), cayenne to taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of pickled-onion liquor, thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}8533{_}_Mode_.--Wash the palates, and put them into a stewpan, with sufficient water to cover them, and let them boil until perfectly tender, or until the upper skin may be easily peeled off.
10136-8{_}8534{_}Have ready sufficient gravy (No.
10136-8{_}8535{_}438) to cover them; add a good seasoning of cayenne, and thicken with roux, No.
10136-8{_}8536{_}625, or a little butter kneaded with flour; let it boil up, and skim.
10136-8{_}8537{_}Cut the palates into square pieces, put them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently for 1/2 hour; add ketchup and onion-liquor, give one boil, and serve.
10136-8{_}8538{_}_Time_.--From 3 to 5 hours to boil the palates.
10136-8{_}8539{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}8540{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8541{_}_Note_.--Palates may be dressed in various ways with sauce tournée, good onion sauce, tomato sauce, and also served in a vol-au-vent; but the above will be found a more simple method of dressing them.
10136-8{_}8542{_}BEEF PICKLE, which may also be used for any kind of Meat, Tongues, or Hams.
10136-8{_}8543{_}654.
10136-8{_}8544{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 lbs.
10136-8{_}8545{_}of salt, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}8546{_}of fine sugar, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}8547{_}of powdered saltpetre, 3 gallons of spring water.
10136-8{_}8548{_}_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients gently together, so long as any scum or impurity arises, which carefully remove; when quite cold, pour it over the meat, every part of which must be covered with the brine.
10136-8{_}8549{_}This may be used for pickling any kind of meat, and may be kept for some time, if boiled up occasionally with an addition of the ingredients.
10136-8{_}8550{_}_Time_.--A ham should be kept in the pickle for a fortnight; a piece of beef weighing 14 lbs., 12 or 15 days; a tongue, 10 days or a fortnight.
10136-8{_}8551{_}_Note_.--For salting and pickling meat, it is a good plan to rub in only half the quantity of salt directed, and to let it remain for a day or two to disgorge and effectually to get rid of the blood and slime; then rub in the remainder of the salt and other ingredients, and proceed as above.
10136-8{_}8552{_}This rule may be applied to all the recipes we have given for salting and pickling meat.
10136-8{_}8553{_}TO PICKLE PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF FOR HANGING.
10136-8{_}8554{_}655.
10136-8{_}8555{_}INGREDIENTS.--For 14 lbs.
10136-8{_}8556{_}of a round of beef allow 1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}8557{_}of salt, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}8558{_}of powdered saltpetre; or, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}8559{_}of salt, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}8560{_}of sugar, 4 oz.
10136-8{_}8561{_}of powdered saltpetre.
10136-8{_}8562{_}_Mode_.--Rub in, and sprinkle either of the above mixtures on 14 lbs.
10136-8{_}8563{_}of meat.
10136-8{_}8564{_}Keep it in an earthenware pan, or a deep wooden tray, and turn twice a week during 3 weeks; then bind up the beef tightly with coarse linen tape, and hang it in a kitchen in which a fire is constantly kept, for 3 weeks.
10136-8{_}8565{_}Pork, hams, and bacon may be cured in a similar way, but will require double the quantity of the salting mixture; and, if not smoke-dried, they should be taken down from hanging after 3 or 4 weeks, and afterwards kept in boxes or tubs, amongst dry oat-husks.
10136-8{_}8566{_}_Time_.--2 or 3 weeks to remain in the brine; to be hung 3 weeks.
10136-8{_}8567{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8568{_}_Note_.--The meat may be boiled fresh from this pickle, instead of smoking it.
10136-8{_}8569{_}BEEP RAGOUT (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}8570{_}656.
10136-8{_}8571{_}INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}8572{_}of cold roast beef, 6 onions, pepper, salt, and mixed spices to taste; 1/2 pint of boiling water, 3 tablespoonfuls of gravy.
10136-8{_}8573{_}_Mode_.--Cut the beef into rather large pieces, and put them into a stewpan with the onions, which must be sliced.
10136-8{_}8574{_}Season well with pepper, salt, and mixed spices, and pour over about 1/2 pint of boiling water, and gravy in the above proportion (gravy saved from the meat answers the purpose); let the whole stew very gently for about 2 hours, and serve with pickled walnuts, gherkins, or capers, just warmed in the gravy.
10136-8{_}8575{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}8576{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.
10136-8{_}8577{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8578{_}ROAST RIBS OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8579{_}657.
10136-8{_}8580{_}INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.
10136-8{_}8581{_}_Mode_.---The fore-rib is considered the primest roasting piece, but the middle-rib is considered the most economical.
10136-8{_}8582{_}Let the meat be well hung (should the weather permit), and cut off the thin ends of the bones, which should be salted for a few days, and then boiled.
10136-8{_}8583{_}Put the meat down to a nice clear fire, put some clean dripping into the pan, dredge the joint with a little flour, and keep continually basting the whole time.
10136-8{_}8584{_}Sprinkle some fine salt over it (this must never be done until the joint is dished, as it draws the juices from the meat); pour the dripping from the pan, put in a little boiling: water slightly salted, and _strain_ the gravy over the meat.
10136-8{_}8585{_}Garnish with tufts of scraped horseradish, and send horseradish sauce to table with it (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}8586{_}447).
10136-8{_}8587{_}A Yorkshire pudding (_see_ Puddings) sometimes accompanies this dish, and, if lightly made and well cooked, will be found a very agreeable addition.
10136-8{_}8588{_}_Time_.--10 lbs.
10136-8{_}8589{_}of beef, 2-1/2 hours; 14 to 16 lbs., from 3-1/2 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}8590{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}8591{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8592{_}_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs.
10136-8{_}8593{_}sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.
10136-8{_}8594{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8595{_}MEMORANDA IN ROASTING.--The management of the fire is a point of     primary importance in roasting.
10136-8{_}8596{_}A radiant fire throughout the     operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result.
10136-8{_}8597{_}When     the article to be dressed is thin and delicate, the fire may be     small; but when the joint is large, the fire must fill the     grate.
10136-8{_}8598{_}Meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted     fire, which may soon want recruiting; on the other hand, if the     heat of the fire becomes too fierce, the meat must be removed to     a considerable distance till it is somewhat abated.
10136-8{_}8599{_}Some cooks     always fail in their roasts, though they succeed in nearly     everything else.
10136-8{_}8600{_}A French writer on the culinary art says that     anybody can learn how to cook, but one must be born a roaster.
10136-8{_}8601{_}According to Liebig, beef or mutton cannot be said to be     sufficiently roasted until it has acquired, throughout the whole     mass, a temperature of 158°; but poultry may be well cooked when     the inner parts have attained a temperature of from 130° to     140°.
10136-8{_}8602{_}This depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and     mutton contain, the colouring matter of blood not being     coagulable under 158°.
10136-8{_}8603{_}ROAST RIBS OF BEEF, Boned and Rolled (a very Convenient Joint for a Small Family).
10136-8{_}8604{_}658.
10136-8{_}8605{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 ribs of beef.
10136-8{_}8606{_}_Mode_.--Choose a fine rib of beef, and have it cut according to the weight you require, either wide or narrow.
10136-8{_}8607{_}Bone and roll the meat round, secure it with wooden skewers, and, if necessary, bind it round with a piece of tape.
10136-8{_}8608{_}Spit the beef firmly, or, if a bottle-jack is used, put the joint on the hook, and place it _near_ a nice clear fire.
10136-8{_}8609{_}Let it remain so till the outside of the meat is set, when draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat is done, which can be ascertained by the steam from it drawing towards the fire.
10136-8{_}8610{_}As this joint is solid, rather more than 1/4 hour must be allowed for each lb.
10136-8{_}8611{_}Remove the skewers, put in a plated or silver one, and send the joint to table with gravy in the dish, and garnish with tufts of horseradish.
10136-8{_}8612{_}Horseradish sauce, No.
10136-8{_}8613{_}447, is a great improvement to roast beef.
10136-8{_}8614{_}_Time_.--For 10 lbs.
10136-8{_}8615{_}of the rolled ribs, 3 hours (as the joint is very solid, we have allowed an extra 1/2 hour); for 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}8616{_}Average cost, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}8617{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8618{_}_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs.
10136-8{_}8619{_}for 6 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}8620{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}8621{_}_Note_.--When the weight exceeds 10 lbs., we would not advise the above method of boning and rolling; only in the case of 1 or 2 ribs, when the joint cannot stand upright in the dish, and would look awkward.
10136-8{_}8622{_}The bones should be put in with a few vegetables and herbs, and made into stock.
10136-8{_}8623{_}ROAST BEEF has long been a national dish in England.
10136-8{_}8624{_}In most of     our patriotic songs it is contrasted with the fricasseed frogs,     popularly supposed to be the exclusive diet of Frenchmen.
10136-8{_}8625{_}"O the roast beef of old England,       And O the old English roast beef."
10136-8{_}8626{_}This national chorus is appealed to whenever a song-writer     wishes to account for the valour displayed by Englishmen at sea     or on land.
10136-8{_}8627{_}ROAST SIRLOIN OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8628{_}659.
10136-8{_}8629{_}INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.
10136-8{_}8630{_}_Mode_.--As a joint cannot be well roasted without a good fire, see that it is well made up about 3/4 hour before it is required, so that when the joint is put down, it is clear and bright.
10136-8{_}8631{_}Choose a nice sirloin, the weight of which should not exceed 16 lbs., as the outside would be too much done, whilst the inside would not be done enough.
10136-8{_}8632{_}Spit it or hook it on to the jack firmly, dredge it slightly with flour, and place it near the fire at first, as directed in the preceding recipe.
10136-8{_}8633{_}Then draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat is done.
10136-8{_}8634{_}Sprinkle a small quantity of salt over it, empty the dripping-pan of all the dripping, pour in some boiling water slightly salted, stir it about, and _strain_ over the meat.
10136-8{_}8635{_}Garnish with tufts of horseradish, and send horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding to table with it.
10136-8{_}8636{_}For carving, _see_ p. 317.
10136-8{_}8637{_}_Time_.--A sirloin of 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours; 14 to 16 lbs., about 4 or 4-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}8638{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}8639{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8640{_}_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs.
10136-8{_}8641{_}for 8 or 9 persons.
10136-8{_}8642{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8643{_}The rump, round, and other pieces of beef are roasted in the same manner, allowing for solid joints; 1/4 hour to every lb.
10136-8{_}8644{_}_Note_.---The above is the usual method of roasting moat; but to have it in perfection and the juices kept in, the meat should at first be laid close to the fire, and when the outside is set and firm, drawn away to a good distance, and then left to roast very slowly; where economy is studied, this plan would not answer, as the meat requires to be at the fire double the time of the ordinary way of cooking; consequently, double the quantity of fuel would be consumed.
10136-8{_}8645{_}ORIGIN OF THE WORD "SIRLOIN."
10136-8{_}8646{_}--The loin of beef is said to have     been knighted by King Charles II., at Friday Hall, Chingford.
10136-8{_}8647{_}The "Merry Monarch" returned to this hospitable mansion for     Epping Forest literally "as hungry as a hunter," and beheld,     with delight, a huge loin of beef steaming upon the table.
10136-8{_}8648{_}"A     noble joint!"
10136-8{_}8649{_}exclaimed the king.
10136-8{_}8650{_}"By St. George, it shall have     a title!"
10136-8{_}8651{_}Then drawing his sword, he raised it above the meat,     and cried, with mock dignity, "Loin, we dub thee knight;     henceforward be Sir Loin!"
10136-8{_}8652{_}This anecdote is doubtless     apocryphal, although the oak table upon which the joint was     supposed to have received its knighthood, might have been seen     by any one who visited Friday-Hill House, a few years ago.
10136-8{_}8653{_}It     is, perhaps, a pity to spoil so noble a story; but the interests     of truth demand that we declare that _sirloin_ is probably a     corruption of _surloin_, which signifies the upper part of a     loin, the prefix _sur_ being equivalent to _over_ or _above_.
10136-8{_}8654{_}In     French we find this joint called _surlonge_, which so closely     resembles our _sirloin_, that we may safely refer the two words     to a common origin.

10136-8{_}8664{_}The next day, rub it well with the above ingredients on every side, and let it remain in the pickle for about a fortnight, turning it every day.
10136-8{_}8665{_}It may be boiled fresh from the pickle, or smoked.

10136-8{_}8670{_}_Note_.--The aitch-bone, flank, or brisket may be salted and pickled by any of the recipes we have given for salting beef, allowing less time for small joints to remain in the pickle; for instance, a joint of 8 or 9 lbs.
10136-8{_}8671{_}will be sufficiently salt in about a week.

10136-8{_}8732{_}BAKING MEAT.--Baking exerts some unexplained influence on meat,     rendering it less savoury and less agreeable than meat which has     been roasted.
10136-8{_}8733{_}"Those who have travelled in Germany and France,"     writes Mr. Lewis, one of our most popular scientific authors,     "must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in     the flavour, or want of flavour, of the various 'roasts' served     up at the _table-d'hôte_."
10136-8{_}8734{_}The general explanation is, that the     German and French meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of     England and Holland, owing to the inferiority of pasturage; and     doubtless this is one cause, but it is not the chief cause.
10136-8{_}8735{_}The     meat is inferior, but the cooking is mainly at fault.
10136-8{_}8736{_}The meat     is scarcely ever _roasted_, because there is no coal, and     firewood is expensive.
10136-8{_}8737{_}The meat is therefore _baked;_ and the     consequence of this baking is, that no meat is eatable or eaten,     with its own gravy, but is always accompanied by some sauce more     or less piquant.
10136-8{_}8738{_}The Germans generally believe that in England     we eat our beef and mutton almost raw; they shudder at our     gravy, as if it were so much blood.
10136-8{_}8739{_}STEWED BEEF or RUMP STEAK (an Entree).
10136-8{_}8740{_}666.
10136-8{_}8741{_}INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs.

10136-8{_}8743{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 do.
10136-8{_}8744{_}of pepper, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of flour.
10136-8{_}8745{_}_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut tolerably thick and rather lean; divide them into convenient-sized pieces, and fry them in the butter a nice brown on both sides.
10136-8{_}8746{_}Cleanse and pare the vegetables, cut the onions and carrots into thin slices, and the turnips into dice, and fry these in the same fat that the steaks were done in.
10136-8{_}8747{_}Put all into a saucepan, add 1/2 pint of water, or rather more should it be necessary, and simmer very gently for 2-1/2 or 3 hours; when nearly done, skim well, add salt, pepper, and ketchup in the above proportions, and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour mixed with 2 of cold water.
10136-8{_}8748{_}Let it boil up for a minute or two after the thickening is added, and serve.
10136-8{_}8749{_}When a vegetable-scoop is at hand, use it to cut the vegetables in fanciful shapes, and tomato, Harvey's sauce, or walnut-liquor may be used to flavour the gravy.
10136-8{_}8750{_}It is less rich if stewed the previous day, so that the fat may be taken off when cold; when wanted for table, it will merely require warming through.
10136-8{_}8751{_}_Time_.--3 hours.
10136-8{_}8752{_}Average cost, 1s.
10136-8{_}8753{_}per lb.

10136-8{_}8778{_}of a brisket of beef, vinegar and salt, 6 carrots, 6 turnips, 6 small onions, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 whole allspice pounded, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup; stock, or water.
10136-8{_}8779{_}_Mode_.--About an hour before dressing it, rub the meat over with vinegar and salt; put it into a stewpan, with sufficient stock to cover it (when this is not at hand, water may be substituted for it), and be particular that the stewpan is not much larger than the meat.
10136-8{_}8780{_}Skim well, and when it has simmered very gently for 1 hour, put in the vegetables, and continue simmering till the meat is perfectly tender.
10136-8{_}8781{_}Draw out the bones, dish the meat, and garnish either with tufts of cauliflower or braised cabbage cut in quarters.
10136-8{_}8782{_}Thicken as much gravy as required, with a little butter and flour; add spices and ketchup in the above proportion, give one boil, pour some of it over the meat, and the remainder send in a tureen.

10136-8{_}8789{_}STEWED RUMP OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8790{_}670.
10136-8{_}8791{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 rump of beef, sufficient stock to cover it (No.
10136-8{_}8792{_}105), 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1 large bunch of savoury herbs, 2 onions, 12 cloves, pepper and salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine.
10136-8{_}8793{_}_Mode_.--Cut out the bone, sprinkle the meat with a little cayenne (this must be sparingly used), and bind and tie it firmly up with tape; put it into a stewpan with sufficient stock to cover it, and add vinegar, ketchup, herbs, onions, cloves, and seasoning in the above proportion, and simmer very gently for 4 or 5 hours, or until the meat is perfectly tender, which may be ascertained by piercing it with a thin skewer.
10136-8{_}8794{_}When done, remove the tape, lay it into a deep dish, which keep hot; strain and skim the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add a glass of port wine and any flavouring to make the gravy rich and palatable; let it boil up, pour over the meat, and serve.
10136-8{_}8795{_}This dish may be very much enriched by garnishing with forcemeat balls, or filling up the space whence the bone is taken with a good forcemeat; sliced carrots, turnips, and onions boiled with the meat, are also a great improvement, and, where expense is not objected to, it may be glazed.
10136-8{_}8796{_}This, however, is not necessary where a good gravy is poured round and over the meat.
10136-8{_}8797{_}_Time_.--1/2 rump stewed gently from 4 to 5 hours.
10136-8{_}8798{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}8799{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8800{_}_Sufficient_ for 8 or 10 persons.
10136-8{_}8801{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8802{_}_Note_.--A stock or gravy in which to boil the meat, may be made of the bone and trimmings, by boiling them with water, and adding carrots, onions, turnips, and a bunch of sweet herbs.
10136-8{_}8803{_}To make this dish richer and more savoury, half-roast the rump, and afterwards stew it in strong stock and a little Madeira.
10136-8{_}8804{_}This is an expensive method, and is not, after all, much better than a plainer-dressed joint.
10136-8{_}8805{_}THE BARON OF BEEF.--This noble joint, which consisted of two     sirloins not cut asunder, was a favourite dish of our ancestors.
10136-8{_}8806{_}It is rarely seen nowadays; indeed, it seems out of place on a     modern table, as it requires the grim boar's head and Christmas     pie as supporters.
10136-8{_}8807{_}Sir Walter Scott has described a feast at     which the baron of beef would have appeared to great advantage.
10136-8{_}8808{_}We will quote a few lines to remind us of those days when     "England was merry England," and when hospitality was thought to     be the highest virtue.
10136-8{_}8809{_}"The fire, with well-dried logs supplied,       Went roaring up the chimney wide;       The huge hall-table's oaken face,       Scrubb'd till it shone, the day to grace,       Bore then, upon its massive board,       No mark to part the squire and lord.
10136-8{_}8810{_}Then was brought in the lusty brawn,       By old blue-coated serving-man;       Then the grim boar's head frown'd on high,       Crested with bays and rosemary.
10136-8{_}8811{_}Well can the green-garb'd ranger tell       How, when, and where the monster fell;       What dogs before his death he tore,       And all the baiting of the boar;       While round the merry wassel bowl,       Garnish'd with ribbons, blithe did trowl.
10136-8{_}8812{_}There the huge sirloin reek'd; hard by       Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pie;       Nor fail'd old Scotland to produce,       At such high tide, her savoury goose."
10136-8{_}8813{_}When a lord's son came of age, in the olden time, the baron of     beef was too small a joint, by many degrees, to satisfy the     retainers who would flock to the hall; a whole ox was therefore     generally roasted over a fire built up of huge logs.
10136-8{_}8814{_}We may here     mention, that an ox was roasted entire on the frozen Thames, in     the early part of the present century.
10136-8{_}8815{_}STEWED SHIN OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8816{_}671.
10136-8{_}8817{_}INGREDIENTS.--A shin of beef, 1 head of celery, 1 onion, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, 4 carrots, 12 button onions, 2 turnips, thickening of butter and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine; pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}8818{_}_Mode_.--Have the bone sawn into 4 or 5 pieces, cover with hot water, bring it to a boil, and remove any scum that may rise to the surface.
10136-8{_}8819{_}Put in the celery, onion, herbs, spice, and seasoning, and simmer very gently until the meat is tender.
10136-8{_}8820{_}Peel the vegetables, cut them into any shape fancy may dictate, and boil them with the onions until tender; lift out the beef, put it on a dish, which keep hot, and thicken with butter and flour as much of the liquor as will be wanted for gravy; keep stirring till it boils, then strain and skim.
10136-8{_}8821{_}Put the gravy back in the stewpan, add the seasoning, port wine, and ketchup, give one boil, and pour it over the beef; garnish with the boiled carrots, turnips, and onions.
10136-8{_}8822{_}_Time_.--The meat to be stewed about 4 hours.
10136-8{_}8823{_}_Average cost_, 4d.

10136-8{_}8832{_}For the batter, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}8833{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the steak and kidney into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a pie-dish, with a good seasoning of salt and pepper; mix the flour with a small quantity of milk at first, to prevent its being lumpy; add the remainder, and the 3 eggs, which should be well beaten; put in the salt, stir the batter for about 5 minutes, and pour it over the steak.
10136-8{_}8834{_}Place it in a tolerably brisk oven immediately, and bake for 1-1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}8843{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 tongue, a bunch of savoury herbs, water.
10136-8{_}8844{_}_Mode_.--In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried or pickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which denotes its being young and tender.
10136-8{_}8845{_}If a dried one, and rather hard, soak it at least for 12 hours previous to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the pickle, 2 or 3 hours will be sufficient for it to remain in sock.
10136-8{_}8846{_}Put the tongue in a stewpan with plenty of cold water and a bunch of savoury herbs; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well and simmer very gently until tender.
10136-8{_}8847{_}Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts, and serve.
10136-8{_}8848{_}Boiled tongue is frequently sent to table with boiled poultry, instead of ham, and is, by many persons, preferred.
10136-8{_}8849{_}If to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down to a piece of board by sticking a fork through the root, and another through the top, to straighten it.
10136-8{_}8850{_}When cold, glaze it, and put a paper ruche round the root, and garnish with tufts of parsley.
10136-8{_}8851{_}_Time_.--A large smoked tongue, 4 to 4-1/2 hours; a small one, 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

10136-8{_}8883{_}[Illustration: BEEF TONGUE.]
10136-8{_}8884{_}THE TONGUES OF ANIMALS.--The tongue, whether in the ox or in     man, is the seat of the sense of taste.
10136-8{_}8885{_}This sense warns the     animal against swallowing deleterious substances.
10136-8{_}8886{_}Dr. Carpenter     says, that, among the lower animals, the instinctive perceptions     connected with this sense, are much more remarkable than our     own; thus, an omnivorous monkey will seldom touch fruits of a     poisonous character, although their taste may be agreeable.
10136-8{_}8887{_}However this may be, man's instinct has decided that ox-tongue     is better than horse-tongue; nevertheless, the latter is     frequently substituted by dishonest dealers for the former.
10136-8{_}8888{_}The     horse's tongue may be readily distinguished by a spoon-like     expansion at its end.
10136-8{_}8889{_}TO PICKLE AND DRESS A TONGUE TO EAT COLD.
10136-8{_}8890{_}676.

10136-8{_}8895{_}of coarse sugar; cloves, mace, and allspice to taste; butter, common crust of flour and water.
10136-8{_}8896{_}_Mode_.--Lay the tongue for a fortnight in the above pickle, turn it every day, and be particular that the spices are well pounded; put it into a small pan just large enough to hold it, place some pieces of butter on it, and cover with a common crust.
10136-8{_}8897{_}Bake in a slow oven until so tender that a straw would penetrate it; take off the skin, fasten it down to a piece of board by running a fork through the root and another through the tip, at the same time straightening it and putting it into shape.
10136-8{_}8898{_}When cold, glaze it, put a paper ruche round the root, which is generally very unsightly, and garnish with tufts of parsley.
10136-8{_}8899{_}_Time_.--From 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven, according to size.
10136-8{_}8900{_}_Average cost_, for a medium-sized uncured tongue, 2s.

10136-8{_}8902{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8903{_}TO DRESS TRIPE.
10136-8{_}8904{_}677.
10136-8{_}8905{_}INGREDIENTS.--Tripe, onion sauce, No.
10136-8{_}8906{_}484, milk and water.
10136-8{_}8907{_}_Mode_.--Ascertain that the tripe is quite fresh, and have it cleaned and dressed.
10136-8{_}8908{_}Cut away the coarsest fat, and boil it in equal proportions of milk and water for 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}8909{_}Should the tripe be entirely undressed, more than double that time should be allowed for it.
10136-8{_}8910{_}Have ready some onion sauce made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}8911{_}4S4, dish the tripe, smother it with the sauce, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}8912{_}_Time_.--1 hour: for undressed tripe, from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.
10136-8{_}8913{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}8914{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}8915{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}8916{_}_Note_.--Tripe may be dressed in a variety of ways: it may be cut in pieces and fried in batter, stewed in gravy with mushrooms, or cut into collops, sprinkled with minced onion and savoury herbs, and fried a nice brown in clarified butter.
10136-8{_}8917{_}BEEF CARVING.
10136-8{_}8918{_}AITCHBONE OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8919{_}A boiled aitch-bone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve, as will be seen on reference to the accompanying engraving.
10136-8{_}8920{_}By following with the knife the direction of the line from 1 to 2, nice slices will be easily cut.
10136-8{_}8921{_}It may be necessary, as in a round of beef, to cut a thick slice off the outside before commencing to serve.
10136-8{_}8922{_}[Illustration]  BRISKET OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8923{_}There is but little description necessary to add, to show the carving of a boiled brisket of beef, beyond the engraving here inserted.
10136-8{_}8924{_}The only point to be observed is, that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones, so that, on its reappearance at table, it should not have a jagged and untidy look.
10136-8{_}8925{_}[Illustration]  RIBS OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8926{_}This dish resembles the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or undercut.
10136-8{_}8927{_}As explained in the recipes, the end piece is often cut off, salted and boiled.
10136-8{_}8928{_}The mode of carving is similar to that of the sirloin, viz., in the direction of the dotted line from 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}8929{_}This joint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carving the sirloin; namely, the inserting of the knife immediately between the bone and the moat, before commencing to cut it into slices.
10136-8{_}8930{_}All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices.
10136-8{_}8931{_}Horseradish, finely scraped, may be served as a garnish; but horseradish sauce is preferable for eating with the beef.
10136-8{_}8932{_}[Illustration]  SIRLOIN OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8933{_}This dish is served differently at various tables, some preferring it to come to table with the fillet, or, as it is usually called, the undercut, uppermost.
10136-8{_}8934{_}The reverse way, as shown in the cut, is that most usually adopted.
10136-8{_}8935{_}Still the undercut is best eaten when hot; consequently, the carver himself may raise the joint, and cut some slices from the under side, in the direction of from 1 to 2, as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters.
10136-8{_}8936{_}The upper part of the sirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and care should be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices.
10136-8{_}8937{_}It will be found a great assistance, in carving this joint well, if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along between the bone and meat, and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the side of the joint.
10136-8{_}8938{_}The slices will then come away more readily.
10136-8{_}8939{_}[Illustration]  Some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across, as shown by the line from 3 to 4; but this is a wasteful plan, and one not to be recommended.
10136-8{_}8940{_}With the sirloin, very finely-scraped horseradish is usually served, and a little given, when liked, to each guest.
10136-8{_}8941{_}Horseradish sauce is preferable, however, for serving on the plate, although the scraped horseradish may still be used as a garnish.
10136-8{_}8942{_}[Illustration]  A ROUND OF BEEF.
10136-8{_}8943{_}A round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef, and to manage it properly, a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is necessary.
10136-8{_}8944{_}Off the outside of the joint, at its top, a thick slice should first be cut, so as to leave the surface smooth; then thin and even slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line 1 to 2; and with each slice of the lean a delicate morsel of the fat should be served.
10136-8{_}8945{_}[Illustration]  BEEF TONGUE.
10136-8{_}8946{_}Passing the knife down in the direction of from 1 to 2, a not too thin slice should be helped; and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper side are served.
10136-8{_}8947{_}The fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the tongue, and cutting in the direction of from 3 to 4.

10136-8{_}8949{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHEEP AND LAMB.
10136-8{_}8950{_}678.
10136-8{_}8951{_}OF ALL WILD or DOMESTICATED ANIMALS, the sheep is, without exception, the most useful to man as a food, and the most necessary to his health and comfort; for it not only supplies him with the lightest and most nutritious of meats, but, in the absence of the cow, its udder yields him milk, cream, and a sound though inferior cheese; while from its fat he obtains light, and from its fleece broadcloth, kerseymere, blankets, gloves, and hose.
10136-8{_}8952{_}Its bones when burnt make an animal charcoal--ivory black--to polish his boots, and when powdered, a manure for the cultivation of his wheat; the skin, either split or whole, is made into a mat for his carriage, a housing for his horse, or a lining for his hat, and many other useful purposes besides, being extensively employed in the manufacture of parchment; and finally, when oppressed by care and sorrow, the harmonious strains that carry such soothing contentment to the heart, are elicited from the musical strings, prepared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep.
10136-8{_}8953{_}679.
10136-8{_}8954{_}THIS VALUABLE ANIMAL, of which England is estimated to maintain an average stock of 32,000,000, belongs to the class already indicated under the ox,--the _Mammalia_; to the order of _Rumenantia_, or cud-chewing animal; to the tribe of _Capridae_, or horned quadrupeds; and the genus _Ovis_, or the "sheep."
10136-8{_}8955{_}The sheep may be either with or without horns; when present, however, they have always this peculiarity, that they spring from a triangular base, are spiral in form, and lateral, at the side of the head, in situation.
10136-8{_}8956{_}The fleece of the sheep is of two sorts, either short and harsh, or soft and woolly; the wool always preponderating in an exact ratio to the care, attention, and amount of domestication bestowed on the animal.
10136-8{_}8957{_}The generic peculiarities of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the horns, always larger in the male when present, but absent in the most cultivated species; having sinuses at the base of all the toes of the four feet, with two rudimentary hoofs on the fore legs, two inguinal teats to the udder, with a short tail in the wild breed, but of varying length in the domesticated; have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw, but in their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum, on which the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds; in the lower jaw there are eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of both jaws, making in all 32 teeth.
10136-8{_}8958{_}The fleece consists of two coats, one to keep the animal warm, the other to carry off the water without wetting the skin.
10136-8{_}8959{_}The first is of wool, the weight and fineness of which depend on the quality of the pasture and the care bestowed on the flock; the other of hair, that pierces the wool and overlaps it, and is in excess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention with which the animal is treated.
10136-8{_}8960{_}680.
10136-8{_}8961{_}THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE GRAZIER is to procure an animal that will yield the greatest pecuniary return in the shortest time; or, in other words, soonest convert grass and turnips into good mutton and fine fleece.
10136-8{_}8962{_}All sheep will not do this alike; some, like men, are so restless and irritable, that no system of feeding, however good, will develop their frames or make them fat.
10136-8{_}8963{_}The system adopted by the breeder to obtain a valuable animal for the butcher, is to enlarge the capacity and functions of the digestive organs, and reduce those of the head and chest, or the mental and respiratory organs.
10136-8{_}8964{_}In the first place, the mind should be tranquillized, and those spaces that can never produce animal fibre curtailed, and greater room afforded, as in the abdomen, for those that can.
10136-8{_}8965{_}And as nothing militates against the fattening process so much as restlessness, the chief wish of the grazier is to find a dull, indolent sheep, one who, instead of frisking himself, leaping his wattles, or even condescending to notice the butting gambols of his silly companions, silently fills his paunch with pasture, and then seeking a shady nook, indolently and luxuriously chows his cud with closed eyes and blissful satisfaction, only rising when his delicious repast is ended, to proceed silently and without emotion to repeat the pleasing process of laying in more provender, and then returning to his dreamy siesta to renew the delightful task of rumination.
10136-8{_}8966{_}Such animals are said to have a _lymphatic_ temperament, and are of so kindly a nature, that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily.
10136-8{_}8967{_}The Leicestershire breed is the best example of this lymphatic and contented animal, and the active Orkney, who is half goat in his habits, of the restless and unprofitable.
10136-8{_}8968{_}The rich pasture of our midland counties would take years in making the wiry Orkney fat and profitable, while one day's fatigue in climbing rocks after a coarse and scanty herbage would probably cause the actual death of the pampered and short-winded Leicester.
10136-8{_}8969{_}681.
10136-8{_}8970{_}THE MORE REMOVED FROM THE NATURE of the animal is the food on which it lives, the more difficult is the process of assimilation, and the more complex the chain of digestive organs; for it must be evident to all, that the same apparatus that converts _flesh_ into _flesh_, is hardly calculated to transmute _grass_ into flesh.
10136-8{_}8971{_}As the process of digestion in carnivorous animals is extremely simple, these organs are found to be remarkably short, seldom exceeding the length of the animal's body; while, where digestion is more difficult, from the unassimilating nature of the aliment, as in the ruminant order, the alimentary canal, as is the case with the sheep, is _twenty-seven times the length of the body._ The digestive organ in all ruminant animals consists of _four stomachs_, or, rather, a capacious pouch, divided by doorways and valves into four compartments, called, in their order of position, the Paunch, the Reticulum, the Omasum, and the Abomasum.
10136-8{_}8972{_}When the sheep nibbles the grass, and is ignorantly supposed to be eating, he is, in fact, only preparing the raw material of his meal, in reality only mowing the pasture, which, as he collects, is swallowed instantly, passing into the first receptacle, the _paunch_, where it is surrounded by a quantity of warm saliva, in which the herbage undergoes a process of maceration or softening, till the animal having filled this compartment, the contents pass through a valve into the second or smaller bag,--the _reticulum_, where, having again filled the paunch with a reserve, the sheep lies down and commences that singular process of chewing the cud, or, in other words, masticating the food he has collected.
10136-8{_}8973{_}By the operation of a certain set of muscles, a small quantity of this softened food from the _reticulum_, or second bag, is passed into the mouth, which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to grind under his molar teeth into a soft smooth pulp, the operation being further assisted by a flow of saliva, answering the double purpose of increasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the mass.
10136-8{_}8974{_}Having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful, it is swallowed a second time; but instead of returning to the paunch or reticulum, it passes through another valve into a side cavity,--the _omasum_, where, after a maceration in more saliva for some hours, it glides by the same contrivance into the fourth pouch,--the _abomasum_, an apartment in all respects analogous to the ordinary stomach of animals, and where the process of digestion, begun and carried on in the previous three, is here consummated, and the nutrient principle, by means of the bile, eliminated from the digested aliment.
10136-8{_}8975{_}Such is the process of digestion in sheep and oxen.
10136-8{_}8976{_}682.
10136-8{_}8977{_}NO OTHER ANIMAL, even of the same order, possesses in so remarkable a degree the power of converting pasture into flesh as the Leicestershire sheep; the South Down and Cheviot, the two next breeds in quality, are, in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animal's nature, not equal to it in that respect, though in both the brain and chest are kept subservient to the greater capacity of the organs of digestion.
10136-8{_}8978{_}Besides the advantage of increased bulk and finer fleeces, the breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those parts of the carcase most esteemed as food, or, what are called in the trade "prime joints;" and so far has this been effected, that the comparative weight of the hind quarters over the fore has become a test of quality in the breed, the butchers in some markets charging twopence a pound more for that portion of the sheep.
10136-8{_}8979{_}Indeed, so superior are the hind quarters of mutton now regarded, that very many of the West-end butchers never deal in any other part of the sheep.
10136-8{_}8980{_}683.
10136-8{_}8981{_}THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH in various breeds is a well-established fact, not alone in flavour, but also in tenderness; and that the nature of the pasture on which the sheep is fed influences the flavour of the meat, is equally certain, and shown in the estimation in which those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of Bamstead in Sussex.
10136-8{_}8982{_}It is also a well-established truth, that the _larger_ the frame of the animal, the _coarser_ is the meat, and that _small bones_ are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the delicacy of the flesh.
10136-8{_}8983{_}The sex too has much to do in determining the quality of the meat; in the males, the lean is closer in fibre, deeper in colour, harder in texture, less juicy, and freer from fat, than in the female, and is consequently tougher and more difficult of digestion; but probably age, and the character of the pasturage on which they are reared, has, more than any other cause, an influence on the quality and tenderness of the meat.
10136-8{_}8984{_}684.
10136-8{_}8985{_}THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES of sheep inhabiting the different regions of the earth have been reduced by Cuvier to three, or at most four, species: the _Ovis Amman_, or the Argali, the presumed parent stock of all the rest; the _Ovis Tragelaphus_, the bearded sheep of Africa; the _Ovis Musmon_, the Musmon of Southern Europe; and the _Ovis Montana_, the Mouflon of America; though it is believed by many naturalists that this last is so nearly identical with the Indian Argali as to be undeserving a separate place.
10136-8{_}8986{_}It is still a controversy to which of these three we are indebted for the many breeds of modern domestication; the Argali, however, by general belief, has been considered as the most _probable_ progenitor of the present varieties.
10136-8{_}8987{_}685.
10136-8{_}8988{_}THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY CHANGE OF CLIMATE, accident, and other causes, must have been great to accomplish so complete a physical alteration as the primitive Argali must have undergone before the Musmon, or Mouflon of Corsica, the _immediate_ progenitor of all our European breeds, assumed his present appearance.
10136-8{_}8989{_}The Argali is about a fifth larger in size than the ordinary English sheep, and being a native of a tropical clime, his fleece is of hair instead of wool, and of a warm reddish brown, approaching to yellow; a thick mane of darker hair, about seven inches long, commences from two long tufts at the angle of the jaws, and, running _under_ the throat and neck, descends down the chest, dividing, at the fore fork, into two parts, one running down the front of each leg, as low as the shank.
10136-8{_}8990{_}The horns, unlike the character of the order generally, have a quadrangular base, and, sweeping inwards, terminate in a sharp point.
10136-8{_}8991{_}The tail, about seven inches long, ends in a tuft of stiff hairs.
10136-8{_}8992{_}From this remarkable muffler-looking beard, the French have given the species the name of _Mouflon à manchettes_.
10136-8{_}8993{_}From the primitive stock _eleven_ varieties have been reared in this country, of the domesticated sheep, each supposed by their advocates to possess some one or more special qualities.
10136-8{_}8994{_}These eleven, embracing the Shetland or Orkney; the Dun-woolled; Black-faced, or heath-bred; the Moorland, or Devonshire; the Cheviot; the Horned, of Norfolk the Ryeland; South-Down; the Merino; the Old Leicester, and the Teeswater, or New Leicester, have of late years been epitomized; and, for all useful and practical purposes, reduced to the following four orders:--  686.
10136-8{_}8995{_}THE SOUTH-DOWN, the LEICESTER, the BLACK-FACED, and the CHEVIOT.
10136-8{_}8996{_}[Illustration: SOUTH-DOWN RAM.]
10136-8{_}8997{_}[Illustration: SOUTH-DOWN EWE.]
10136-8{_}8998{_}687.
10136-8{_}8999{_}SOUTH-DOWNS.--It appears, as far as our investigation can trace the fact, that from the very earliest epoch of agricultural history in England, the breezy range of light chalky hills running through the south-west and south of Sussex and Hampshire, and known as the South-Downs, has been famous for a superior race of sheep; and we find the Romans early established mills and a cloth-factory at Winchester, where they may be said to terminate, which rose to such estimation, from the fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth, that the produce was kept as only worthy to clothe emperors.
10136-8{_}9000{_}From this, it may be inferred that sheep have always been indigenous to this hilly tract.
10136-8{_}9001{_}Though boasting so remote a reputation, it is comparatively within late years that the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has been effected, the South-Down new ranking, for symmetry of shape, constitution, and early maturity, with any stock in the kingdom.
10136-8{_}9002{_}The South-Down has no horns, is covered with a fine wool from two to three inches long, has a small head, and legs and face of a grey colour.
10136-8{_}9003{_}It is, however, considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest.
10136-8{_}9004{_}A marked peculiarity of this breed is that its hind quarters stand higher than the fore, the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen pounds.
10136-8{_}9005{_}[Illustration: LEICESTER RAM.]
10136-8{_}9006{_}[Illustration: LEICESTER EWE.]
10136-8{_}9007{_}688.
10136-8{_}9008{_}THE LEICESTER.--It was not till the year 1755 that Mr. Robert Bakewell directed his attention to the improvement of his stock of sheep, and ultimately effected that change in the character of his flock which has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place.
10136-8{_}9009{_}The Leicester is regarded as the largest example of the improved breeds, very productive, and yielding a good fleece.
10136-8{_}9010{_}He has a small head, covered with short white hairs, a clean muzzle, an open countenance, full eye, long thin ear, tapering neck, well-arched ribs, and straight back.
10136-8{_}9011{_}The meat is indifferent, its flavour not being so good as that of the South-Down, and there is a very large proportion of fat.
10136-8{_}9012{_}Average weight of carcase from 90 to 100 lbs.
10136-8{_}9013{_}[Illustration: HEATH RAM.]
10136-8{_}9014{_}[Illustration: HEATH EWE.]
10136-8{_}9015{_}689.
10136-8{_}9016{_}BLACK-FACED, on HEATH-BRED SHEEP.--This is the most hardy of all our native breeds, and originally came from Ettrick Forest.
10136-8{_}9017{_}The face and legs are black, or sometimes mottled, the horns spiral, and on the top of the forehead it has a small round tuft of lighter-coloured wool than on the face; has the muzzle and lips of the same light hue, and what shepherds call a mealy mouth; the eye is full of vivacity and fire, and well open; the body long, round, and firm, and the limbs robust.
10136-8{_}9018{_}The wool is thin, coarse, and light.
10136-8{_}9019{_}Weight of the quarter, from 10 to 16 lbs.
10136-8{_}9020{_}690.
10136-8{_}9021{_}THE CHEVIOT.--From the earliest traditions, these hills in the North, like the chalk-ridges in the South, have possessed a race of large-carcased sheep, producing a valuable fleece.
10136-8{_}9022{_}To these physical advantages, they added a sound constitution, remarkable vigour, and capability to endure great privation.
10136-8{_}9023{_}Both sexes are destitute of horns, face white, legs long and clean, carries the head erect, has the throat and neck well covered, the cars long and open, and the face animated.
10136-8{_}9024{_}The Cheviot is a small-boned sheep, and well covered with wool to the hough; the only defect in this breed, is in a want of depth in the chest.
10136-8{_}9025{_}Weight of the quarter, from 12 to 18 lbs.
10136-8{_}9026{_}[Illustration: ROMNEY-MARSH RAM.]
10136-8{_}9027{_}[Illustration: ROMNEY-MARSH EWE.]
10136-8{_}9028{_}691.
10136-8{_}9029{_}THOUGH THE ROMNEY MARSHES, that wide tract of morass and lowland moor extending from the Weald (or ancient forest) of Kent into Sussex, has rather been regarded as a general feeding-ground for any kind of sheep to be pastured on, it has yet, from the earliest date, been famous for a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality, and especially for size, length, thickness, and quantity of wool, and what is called thickness of stocking; and on this account for ages held pre-eminence over every other breed in the kingdom.
10136-8{_}9030{_}So satisfied were the Kentish men with the superiority of their sheep, that they long resisted any crossing in the breed.
10136-8{_}9031{_}At length, however, this was effected, and from the Old Romney and New Leicester a stock was produced that proved, in an eminent degree, the advantage of the cross; and though the breed was actually smaller than the original, it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food, the stocking was increased, they were ready for the market a _year_ sooner; that the fat formed more on the exterior of the carcase, where it was of most advantage to the grazier, rather than as formerly in the interior, where it went to the butcher as offal; and though the wool was shorter and lighter, it was of a better colour, finer, and possessed of superior felting properties.
10136-8{_}9032{_}692.
10136-8{_}9033{_}THE ROMNEY MARSH BREED is a large animal, deep, close, and compact, with white face and legs, and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality.
10136-8{_}9034{_}The general structure is, however, considered defective, the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse; nevertheless its tendency to fatten, and its early maturity, are universally admitted.
10136-8{_}9035{_}The Romney Marsh, therefore, though not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed, is a highly useful, profitable, and generally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep.
10136-8{_}9036{_}693.
10136-8{_}9037{_}DIFFERENT NAMES HAVE BEEN GIVEN to sheep by their breeders, according to their age and sex.
10136-8{_}9038{_}The male is called a ram, or tup; after weaning, he is said to be a hog, or hogget, or a lamb-hog, tup-hog, or teg; later he is a wether, or wether-hog; after the first shearing, a shearing, or dinmont; and after each succeeding shearing, a two, three, or four-shear ram, tup, or wether, according to circumstances.
10136-8{_}9039{_}The female is called a ewe, or gimmer-lamb, till weaned, when she becomes, according to the shepherd's nomenclature, a gimmer-ewe, hog, or teg; after shearing, a gimmer or shearing-ewe, or theave; and in future a two, three, or four-shear ewe, or theave.
10136-8{_}9040{_}694.
10136-8{_}9041{_}THE MODE OF SLAUGHTERING SHEEP is perhaps as humane and expeditious a process as could be adopted to attain the objects sought: the animal being laid on its side in a sort of concave stool, the butcher, while pressing the body with his knee, transfixes the throat near the angle of the jaw, passing his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck; thus dividing the jugulars, carotids, and large vessels, the death being very rapid from such a hemorrhage.

10136-8{_}9044{_}ALMOST EVERY LARGE CITY has a particular manner of cutting up, or, as it is called, dressing the carcase.
10136-8{_}9045{_}In London this process is very simple, and as our butchers have found that much skewering back, doubling one part over another, or scoring the inner cuticle or fell, tends to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep, they avoid all such treatment entirely.
10136-8{_}9046{_}The carcase when flayed (which operation is performed while yet warm), the sheep when hung up and the head removed, presents the profile shown in our cut; the small numerals indicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut.
10136-8{_}9047{_}After separating the hind from the fore quarters, with eleven ribs to the latter, the quarters are usually subdivided in the manner shown in the sketch, in which the several joins are defined by the intervening lines and figures.
10136-8{_}9048{_}_Hind quarter_: No.
10136-8{_}9049{_}1, the leg; 2, the loin--the two, when cut in one piece, being called the saddle.
10136-8{_}9050{_}_Fore quarter_: No.
10136-8{_}9051{_}3, the shoulder; 4 and 5 the neck; No.
10136-8{_}9052{_}5 being called, for distinction, the scrag, which is generally afterwards separated from 4, the lower and better joint; No.
10136-8{_}9053{_}6, the breast.
10136-8{_}9054{_}The haunch of mutton, so often served at public dinners and special entertainments, comprises all the leg and so much of the loin, short of the ribs or lap, as is indicated on the upper part of the carcase by a dotted line.
10136-8{_}9055{_}696.
10136-8{_}9056{_}THE GENTLE AND TIMID DISPOSITION of the sheep, and its defenceless condition, must very early have attached it to man for motives less selfish than either its fleece or its flesh; for it has been proved beyond a doubt that, obtuse as we generally regard it, it is susceptible of a high degree of domesticity, obedience, and affection.
10136-8{_}9057{_}In many parts of Europe, where the flocks are guided by the shepherd's voice alone, it is no unusual thing for a sheep to quit the herd when called by its name, and follow the keeper like a dog.
10136-8{_}9058{_}In the mountains of Scotland, when a flock is invaded by a savage dog, the rams have been known to form the herd into a circle, and placing themselves on the outside line, keep the enemy at bay, or charging on him in a troop, have despatched him with their horns.
10136-8{_}9059{_}697.
10136-8{_}9060{_}THE VALUE OF THE SHEEP seems to have been early understood by Adam in his fallen state; his skin not only affording him protection for his body, but a covering for his tent; and accordingly, we find Abel intrusted with this portion of his father's stock; for the Bible tells us that "Abel was a keeper of sheep."
10136-8{_}9061{_}What other animals were domesticated at that time we can only conjecture, or at what exact period the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man, is equally, if not uncertain, open to controversy.
10136-8{_}9062{_}For though some authorities maintain the contrary, it is but natural to suppose that when Abel brought firstlings of his flock, "and the fat thereof," as a sacrifice, the less dainty portions, not being oblations, were hardly likely to have been flung away as refuse.
10136-8{_}9063{_}Indeed, without supposing Adam and his descendants to have eaten animal food, we cannot reconcile the fact of Jubal Cain, Cain's son, and his family, living in tents, as they are reported to have done, knowing that both their own garments and the coverings of the tents, were made from the hides and skins of the animals they bred; for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations only, would not have supplied sufficient material for two such necessary purposes.
10136-8{_}9064{_}The opposite opinion is, that animal food was not eaten till after the Flood, when the Lord renewed his covenant with Noah.
10136-8{_}9065{_}From Scriptural authority we learn many interesting facts as regards the sheep: the first, that mutton fat was considered the most delicious portion of any meat, and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite morsel in the whole body; consequently, such were regarded as especially fit for the offer of sacrifice.
10136-8{_}9066{_}From this fact we may reasonably infer that the animal still so often met with in Palestine and Syria, and known as the Fat-tailed sheep, was in use in the days of the patriarchs, though probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to; a supposition that gains greater strength, when it is remembered that the ram Abraham found in the bush, when he went to offer up Isaac, was a horned animal, being entangled in the brake by his curved horns; so far proving that it belonged to the tribe of the Capridae, the fat-tailed sheep appertaining to the same family.
10136-8{_}9067{_}LAMBS.
10136-8{_}9068{_}698.
10136-8{_}9069{_}THOUGH THE LAMBING SEASON IN THIS COUNTRY usually commences in March, under the artificial system, so much pursued now to please the appetite of luxury, lambs can be procured at all seasons.
10136-8{_}9070{_}When, however, the sheep lambs in mid-winter, or the inclemency of the weather would endanger the lives of mother and young, if exposed to its influence, it is customary to rear the lambs within-doors, and under the shelter of stables or barns, where, foddered on soft hay, and part fed on cow's milk, the little creatures thrive rapidly: to such it is customary to give the name of House Lamb, to distinguish it from that reared in the open air, or grass-fed.
10136-8{_}9071{_}The ewe goes five months with her young, about 152 days, or close on 22 weeks.
10136-8{_}9072{_}The weaning season commences on poor lands, about the end of the third month, but on rich pasture not till the close of the fourth--sometimes longer.
10136-8{_}9073{_}699.
10136-8{_}9074{_}FROM THE LARGE PROPORTION OF MOISTURE OR FLUIDS contained in the tissues of all young animals, the flesh of lamb and veal is much more prone, in close, damp weather, to become tainted and spoil than the flesh of the more mature, drier, and closer-textured beef and mutton.
10136-8{_}9075{_}Among epicures, the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the South-Down breed, known by their black feet; and of these, those which have been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent ewe, are considered the finest.
10136-8{_}9076{_}Next to these in estimation are those fed on the milk of several dams, and last of all, though the fattest, the grass-fed lamb; this, however, implies an age much greater than either of the others.
10136-8{_}9077{_}[Illustration: SIDE OF LAMB.]
10136-8{_}9078{_}700.
10136-8{_}9079{_}LAMB, in the early part of the season, however reared, is in London, and indeed generally, sold in quarters, divided with eleven ribs to the forequarter; but, as the season advances, these are subdivided into two, and the hind-quarter in the same manner; the first consisting of the shoulder, and the neck and breast; the latter, of the leg and the loin,--as shown in the cut illustrative of mutton.
10136-8{_}9080{_}As lamb, from the juicy nature of its flesh, is especially liable to spoil in unfavourable weather, it should be frequently wiped, so as to remove any moisture that may form on it.
10136-8{_}9081{_}701.
10136-8{_}9082{_}IN THE PURCHASING OF LAMB FOR THE TABLE, there are certain signs by which the experienced judgment is able to form an accurate opinion whether the animal has been lately slaughtered, and whether the joints possess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat.
10136-8{_}9083{_}The first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and dilated appearance of the eye; the quality of the fore-quarter can always be guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness of the jugular, or vein of the neck; while the rigidity of the knuckle, and the firm, compact feel of the kidney, will answer in an equally positive manner for the integrity of the hind-quarter.

10136-8{_}9094{_}BAKED MINCED MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}9095{_}703.
10136-8{_}9096{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of any joint of cold roast mutton, 1 or 2 onions, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace or nutmeg, 2 tablespoonfuls of gravy, mashed potatoes.
10136-8{_}9097{_}_Mode_.--Mince an onion rather fine, and fry it a light-brown colour; add the herbs and mutton, both of which should be also finely minced and well mixed; season with pepper and salt, and a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and moisten with the above proportion of gravy.
10136-8{_}9098{_}Put a layer of mashed potatoes at the bottom of a dish, then the mutton, and then another layer of potatoes, and bake for about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}9099{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}9100{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.
10136-8{_}9101{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}9102{_}_Note_.--If there should be a large quantity of meat, use 2 onions instead of 1.
10136-8{_}9103{_}BOILED BREAST OF MUTTON AND CAPER SAUCE.
10136-8{_}9104{_}704.
10136-8{_}9105{_}INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs (put a large proportion of parsley), pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}9106{_}_Mode_.--Cut off the superfluous fat; bone it; sprinkle over a layer of bread crumbs, minced herbs, and seasoning; roll, and bind it up firmly.
10136-8{_}9107{_}Boil _gently_ for 2 hours, remove the tape, and serve with caper sauce, No.
10136-8{_}9108{_}382, a little of which should be poured over the meat.
10136-8{_}9109{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}9110{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}9111{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}9112{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}9113{_}_Seasonable_ all the year.
10136-8{_}9114{_}BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9115{_}705.
10136-8{_}9116{_}INGREDIENTS.--Mutton, water, salt.
10136-8{_}9117{_}_Mode_.--A.
10136-8{_}9118{_}leg of mutton for boiling should not hang too long, as it will not look a good colour when dressed.
10136-8{_}9119{_}Cut off the shank-bone, trim the knuckle, and wash and wipe it very clean; plunge it into sufficient boiling water to cover it; let it boil up, then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, where it should remain till the finger can be borne in the water.
10136-8{_}9120{_}Then place it sufficiently near the fire, that the water may gently simmer, and be very careful that it does not boil fast, or the meat will be hard.
10136-8{_}9121{_}Skim well, add a little salt, and in about 2-1/4 hours after the water begins to simmer, a moderate-sized leg of mutton will be done.
10136-8{_}9122{_}Serve with carrots and mashed turnips, which may be boiled with the meat, and send caper sauce (No.
10136-8{_}9123{_}382) to table with it in a tureen.
10136-8{_}9124{_}_Time_.--A moderate-sized leg of mutton of 9 lbs., 2-1/4 hours after the water boils; one of 12 lbs., 3 hours.
10136-8{_}9125{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}9126{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}9127{_}_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized leg of mutton for 6 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}9128{_}_Seasonable_ nearly all the year, but not so good in June, July, and August.
10136-8{_}9129{_}_Note_.--When meat is liked very _thoroughly_ cooked, allow more time than stated above.
10136-8{_}9130{_}The liquor this joint was boiled in should be converted into soup.
10136-8{_}9131{_}THE GOOD SHEPHERD.--The sheep's complete dependence upon the     shepherd for protection from its numerous enemies is frequently     referred to in the Bible; thus the Psalmist likens himself to a     lost sheep, and prays the Almighty to seek his servant; and our     Saviour, when despatching his twelve chosen disciples to preach     the Gospel amongst their unbelieving brethren, compares them to     lambs going amongst wolves.
10136-8{_}9132{_}The shepherd of the East, by kind     treatment, calls forth from his sheep unmistakable signs of     affection.
10136-8{_}9133{_}The sheep obey his voice and recognize the names by     which he calls them, and they follow him in and out of the fold.
10136-8{_}9134{_}The beautiful figure of the "good shepherd," which so often     occurs in the New Testament, expresses the tenderness of the     Saviour for mankind.
10136-8{_}9135{_}"The good shepherd giveth his life for the     sheep."
10136-8{_}9136{_}--_John_, x.
10136-8{_}9137{_}11.
10136-8{_}9138{_}"I am the good shepherd, and know my     sheep, and am known by mine."
10136-8{_}9139{_}--_John_, x.
10136-8{_}9140{_}14.
10136-8{_}9141{_}"And other sheep I     have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and     they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one     shepherd."
10136-8{_}9142{_}--_John_, x.
10136-8{_}9143{_}16.
10136-8{_}9144{_}BONED LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED.
10136-8{_}9145{_}706.
10136-8{_}9146{_}INGREDIENTS.--A small leg of mutton, weighing 6 or 7 lbs., forcemeat, No.
10136-8{_}9147{_}417, 2 shalots finely minced.
10136-8{_}9148{_}_Mode_.--Make a forcemeat by recipe No.
10136-8{_}9149{_}417, to which add 2 finely-minced shalots.
10136-8{_}9150{_}Bone the leg of mutton, without spoiling the skin, and cut off a great deal of the fat.
10136-8{_}9151{_}Fill the hole up whence the bone was taken, with the forcemeat, and sew it up underneath, to prevent its falling out.
10136-8{_}9152{_}Bind and tie it up compactly, and roast it before a nice clear fire for about 2-1/2 hours or rather longer; remove the tape and send it to table with a good gravy.
10136-8{_}9153{_}It may be glazed or not, as preferred.
10136-8{_}9154{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}9155{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}9156{_}8d.
10136-8{_}9157{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}9158{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}9159{_}BRAISED FILLET OF MUTTON, with French Beans.
10136-8{_}9160{_}707.
10136-8{_}9161{_}INGREDIENTS.--The chump end of a loin of mutton, buttered paper, French beans, a little glaze, 1 pint of gravy.
10136-8{_}9162{_}_Mode_.--Roll up the mutton in a piece of buttered paper, roast it for 2 hours, and do not allow it to acquire the least colour.
10136-8{_}9163{_}Have ready some French beans, boiled, and drained on a sieve; remove the paper from the mutton, glaze it; just heat up the beans in the gravy, and lay them on the dish with the meat over them.
10136-8{_}9164{_}The remainder of the gravy may be strained, and sent to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}9165{_}_Time_.--2 hours.
10136-8{_}9166{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}9167{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}9168{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}9169{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}9170{_}VARIOUS QUALITIES OF MUTTON--Mutton is, undoubtedly, the meat     most generally used in families; and, both by connoisseurs and     medical men, it stands first in favour, whether its the favour,     digestible qualifications, or general wholesomeness, be     considered.
10136-8{_}9171{_}Of all mutton, that furnished by South-Down sheep is     the most highly esteemed; it is also the dearest, on account of     its scarcity, and the great demand of it.
10136-8{_}9172{_}Therefore, if the     housekeeper is told by the butcher that he has not any in his     shop, it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser.
10136-8{_}9173{_}The London and other markets are chiefly supplied with sheep     called half-breeds, which are a cross between the Down and     Lincoln or Leicester.
10136-8{_}9174{_}These half-breeds make a greater weight of     mutton than the true South-Downs, and, for this very desirable     qualification, they are preferred by the great sheep-masters.
10136-8{_}9175{_}The legs of this mutton range from 7 to 11 lbs.
10136-8{_}9176{_}in weight; the     shoulders, necks, or loins, about 6 to 9 lbs.
10136-8{_}9177{_}; and if care is     taken not to purchase it; the shoulders, necks, or loins, about     8 to 9 lbs.
10136-8{_}9178{_}; and it cure is taken not to purchase it too fat, it     will be found the most satisfactory and economical mutton that     can be bought.
10136-8{_}9179{_}BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9180{_}708.
10136-8{_}9181{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 small leg of mutton, 4 carrots, 3 onions, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, a bunch of parsley, seasoning to taste of pepper and salt, a few slices of bacon, a few veal trimmings, 1/2 pint of gravy or water.
10136-8{_}9182{_}_Mode_.--Line the bottom of a braising-pan with a few slices of bacon, put in the carrots, onions, herbs, parsley, and seasoning, and over these place the mutton.
10136-8{_}9183{_}Cover the whole with a few more slices of bacon and the veal trimmings, pour in the gravy or water, and stew very gently for 4 hours.
10136-8{_}9184{_}Strain the gravy, reduce it to a glaze over a sharp fire, glaze the mutton with it, and send it to table, placed on a dish of white haricot beans boiled tender, or garnished with glazed onions.
10136-8{_}9185{_}_Time_.--4 hours.
10136-8{_}9186{_}Average cost, 5s.
10136-8{_}9187{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}9188{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}9189{_}THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--This order of knighthood was     founded by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429, on the     day of his marriage with the Princess Isabella of Portugal.
10136-8{_}9190{_}The     number of the members was originally fixed at thirty-one,     including the sovereign, as the head and chief of the     institution.
10136-8{_}9191{_}In 1516, Pope Leo X. consented to increase the     number to fifty-two, including the head.
10136-8{_}9192{_}In 1700 the German     emperor Charles VI.
10136-8{_}9193{_}and King Philip of Spain both laid claim to     the order.
10136-8{_}9194{_}The former, however, on leaving Spain, which he could     not maintain by force of arms, took with him, to Vienna, the     archives of the order, the inauguration of which he solemnized     there in 1713, with great magnificence; but Philip V. of Spain     declared himself Grand Master, and formally protested, at the     congress of Cambrai (1721), against the pretensions of the     emperor.
10136-8{_}9195{_}The dispute, though subsequently settled by the     intercession of France, England, and Holland, was frequently     renewed, until the order was tacitly introduced into both     countries, and it now passes by the respective names of the     Spanish or Austrian "Order of the Golden Fleece," according to     the country where it is issued.
10136-8{_}9196{_}AN EXCELLENT WAY TO COOK A BREAST OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9197{_}709.
10136-8{_}9198{_}INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, flour, a bunch of savoury herbs, green peas.
10136-8{_}9199{_}_Mode_.--Cut the mutton into pieces about 2 inches square, and let it be tolerably lean; put it into a stewpan, with a little fat or butter, and fry it of a nice brown; then dredge in a little flour, slice the onions, and put it with the herbs in the stewpan; pour in sufficient water _just_ to cover the meat, and simmer the whole gently until the mutton is tender.
10136-8{_}9200{_}Take out the meat, strain, and skim off all the fat from the gravy, and put both the meat and gravy back into the stewpan; add about a quart of young green peas, and let them boil gently until done.
10136-8{_}9201{_}2 or 3 slices of bacon added and stewed with the mutton give additional flavour; and, to insure the peas being a beautiful green colour, they may be boiled in water separately, and added to the stew at the moment of serving.
10136-8{_}9202{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}9203{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}9204{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}9205{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}9206{_}_Seasonable_ from June to August.
10136-8{_}9207{_}NAMES OF ANIMALS SAXON, AND OF THEIR FLESH NORMAN.--The names of     all our domestic animals are of Saxon origin; but it is curious     to observe that Norman names have been given to the different     sorts of flesh which these animals yield.
10136-8{_}9208{_}How beautifully this     illustrates the relative position of Saxon and Norman after the     Conquest.
10136-8{_}9209{_}The Saxon hind had the charge of tending and feeding     the domestic animals, but only that they might appear on the     table of his Norman lord.
10136-8{_}9210{_}Thus 'ox,' 'steer,' 'cow,' are Saxon,     but 'beef' is Norman; 'calf' is Saxon, but 'veal' Norman;     'sheep' is Saxon, but 'mutton' Norman; so it is severally with     'deer' and 'venison,' 'swine' and 'pork,' 'fowl' and 'pullet.'
10136-8{_}9211{_}'Bacon,' the only flesh which, perhaps, ever came within his     reach, is the single exception.
10136-8{_}9212{_}BROILED MUTTON AND TOMATO SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}9213{_}710.
10136-8{_}9214{_}INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold mutton, tomato sauce, No.
10136-8{_}9215{_}529.
10136-8{_}9216{_}_Mode_.--Cut some nice slices from a cold leg or shoulder of mutton; season them with pepper and salt, and broil over a clear fire.
10136-8{_}9217{_}Make some tomato sauce by recipe No.
10136-8{_}9218{_}529, pour it over the mutton, and serve.
10136-8{_}9219{_}This makes an excellent dish, and must be served very hot.
10136-8{_}9220{_}_Time_.--About 5 minutes to broil the mutton.
10136-8{_}9221{_}_Seasonable_ in September and October, when tomatoes are plentiful and seasonable.
10136-8{_}9222{_}SHEPHERDS AND THEIR FLOCKS.--The shepherd's crook is older than     either the husbandman's plough or the warrior's sword.
10136-8{_}9223{_}We are     told that Abel was a keeper of sheep.
10136-8{_}9224{_}Many passages in holy writ     enable us to appreciate the pastoral riches of the first eastern     nations; and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks,     when we read that Jacob gave the children of Hamor a hundred     sheep for the price of a field, and that the king of Israel     received a hundred thousand every year from the king of Moab,     his tributary, and a like number of rams covered with their     fleece.
10136-8{_}9225{_}The tendency which most sheep have to ramble, renders it     necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd.
10136-8{_}9226{_}To keep a flock     within bounds, is no easy task; but the watchful shepherd     manages to accomplish it without harassing the sheep.
10136-8{_}9227{_}In the     Highlands of Scotland, where the herbage is scanty, the     sheep-farm requires to be very large, and to be watched over by     many shepherds.
10136-8{_}9228{_}The farms of some of the great Scottish     landowners are of enormous extent.
10136-8{_}9229{_}"How many sheep have you on     your estate?"
10136-8{_}9230{_}asked Prince Esterhazy of the duke of Argyll.
10136-8{_}9231{_}"I     have not the most remote idea," replied the duke; "but I know     the shepherds number several thousands."

10136-8{_}9285{_}THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--The ancient fable of the Golden Fleece may     be thus briefly told:--Phryxus, a son of Athamus, king of     Thebes, to escape the persecutions of his stepmother Ino, paid a     visit to his friend Aeetes, king of Colchis.
10136-8{_}9286{_}A ram, whose fleece     was of pure gold, carried the youth through the air in a most     obliging manner to the court of his friend.
10136-8{_}9287{_}When safe At     Colchis, Phryxus offered the ram on the altars of Mars, and     pocketed the fleece.
10136-8{_}9288{_}The king received him with great kindness,     and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage; but, some time     after, he murdered him in order to obtain possession of the     precious fleece.
10136-8{_}9289{_}The murder of Phryxus was amply revenged by the     Greeks.
10136-8{_}9290{_}It gave rise to the famous Argonautic expedition,     undertaken by Jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of     Greece.
10136-8{_}9291{_}The Argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the     celebrated sorceress Medea, daughter of Aeetes, who fell     desperately in love with the gallant but faithless Jason.
10136-8{_}9292{_}In the     story of the voyage of the Argo, a substratum of truth probably     exists, though overlaid by a mass of fiction.
10136-8{_}9293{_}The ram which     carried Phryxus to Colchis is by some supposed to have been the     name of the ship in which he embarked.
10136-8{_}9294{_}The fleece of gold is     thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from     Thebes.
10136-8{_}9295{_}The alchemists of the fifteenth century were firmly     convinced that the Golden Fleece was a treatise on the     transmutation of metals, written on sheepskin.
10136-8{_}9296{_}HARICOT MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9297{_}I.
10136-8{_}9298{_}716.
10136-8{_}9299{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs.
10136-8{_}9300{_}of the middle or best end of the neck of mutton, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 3 onions, popper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup or Harvey's sauce.
10136-8{_}9301{_}_Mode_.--Trim off some of the fat, cut the mutton into rather thin chops, and put them into a frying-pan with the fat trimmings.
10136-8{_}9302{_}Fry of a pale brown, but do not cook them enough for eating.
10136-8{_}9303{_}Cut the carrots and turnips into dice, and the onions into slices, and slightly fry them in the same fat that the mutton was browned in, but do not allow them to take any colour.
10136-8{_}9304{_}Now lay the mutton at the bottom of a stewpan, then the vegetables, and pour over them just sufficient boiling water to cover the whole.
10136-8{_}9305{_}Give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side of the fire to simmer gently until the meat is tender.
10136-8{_}9306{_}Skim off every particle of fat, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a little ketchup, and serve.
10136-8{_}9307{_}This dish is very much better if made the day before it is wanted for table, as the fat can be so much more easily removed when the gravy is cold.
10136-8{_}9308{_}This should be particularly attended to, as it is apt to be rather rich and greasy if eaten the same day it is made.
10136-8{_}9309{_}It should be served in rather a deep dish.
10136-8{_}9310{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to simmer gently.
10136-8{_}9311{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 3s.

10136-8{_}9318{_}Put all into a stewpan, and moisten with boiling water, adding the onion, stuck with 3 cloves, the mace, and herbs.
10136-8{_}9319{_}Simmer gently till the meat is nearly done, skim off all the fat, and then add the carrots and turnips, which should previously be cut in dice and fried in a little sugar to colour them.
10136-8{_}9320{_}Let the whole simmer again for 10 minutes; take out the onion and bunch of herbs, and serve.
10136-8{_}9321{_}_Time_.--About 3 hours to simmer.

10136-8{_}9331{_}In the mean time boil the vegetables until _nearly_ tender, slice them, and add them to the mutton about 1/4 hour before it is to be served.
10136-8{_}9332{_}Season with pepper and salt, add the ketchup and port wine, give one boil, and serve.
10136-8{_}9333{_}_Time_.--1 hour.

10136-8{_}9338{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast shoulder or leg of mutton, 6 whole peppers, 6 whole allspice, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 head of celery, 1 onion, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}9339{_}of butter, flour.
10136-8{_}9340{_}_Mode_.--Cut the meat in nice even slices from the bones, trimming off all superfluous fat and gristle; chop the bones and fragments of the joint, put them into a stewpan with the pepper, spice, herbs, and celery; cover with water, and simmer for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}9341{_}Slice and fry the onion of a nice pale-brown colour, dredge in a little flour to make it thick, and add this to the bones, &c. Stew for 1/4 hour, strain the gravy, and let it cool; then skim off every particle of fat, and put it, with the meat, into a stewpan.
10136-8{_}9342{_}Flavour with ketchup, Harvey's sauce; tomato sauce, or any flavouring that may be preferred, and let the meat gradually warm through, but not boil, or it will harden.
10136-8{_}9343{_}To hash meat properly, it should be laid in cold gravy, and only left on the fire just long enough to warm through.
10136-8{_}9344{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to simmer the gravy.
10136-8{_}9345{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.
10136-8{_}9346{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}9347{_}HASHED MUTTON.--Many persons express a decided aversion to     hashed mutton; and, doubtless, this dislike has arisen from the     fact that they have unfortunately never been properly served     with this dish.
10136-8{_}9348{_}If properly done, however, the meat tender (it     ought to be as tender as when first roasted), the gravy abundant     and well flavoured, and the sippets nicely toasted, and the     whole served neatly; then, hashed mutton is by no means to be     despised, and is infinitely more wholesome and appetizing than     the cold leg or shoulder, of which fathers and husbands, and     their bachelor friends, stand in such natural awe.

10136-8{_}9386{_}_Note_.--Irish stew may be prepared in the same manner as above, but baked in a jar instead of boiled.
10136-8{_}9387{_}About 2 hours or rather more in a moderate oven will be sufficient time to bake it.
10136-8{_}9388{_}ITALIAN MUTTON CUTLETS.

10136-8{_}9403{_}THE DOWNS.--The well-known substance chalk, which the chemist     regards as a nearly pure carbonate of lime, and the microscopist     as an aggregation of inconceivably minute shells and corals,     forms the sub-soil of the hilly districts of the south-east of     England.
10136-8{_}9404{_}The chalk-hills known as the South Downs start from the     bold promontory of Beachy Head, traverse the county of Sussex     from east to west, and pass through Hampshire into Surrey.
10136-8{_}9405{_}The     North Downs extend from Godalming, by Godstone, into Kent, and     terminate in the line of cliffs which stretches from Dover to     Ramsgate.
10136-8{_}9406{_}The Downs are clothed with short verdant turf; but the     layer of soil which rests upon the chalk is too thin to support     trees and shrubs.
10136-8{_}9407{_}The hills have rounded summits, and their     smooth, undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral     monuments of the early inhabitants of the country.
10136-8{_}9408{_}The coombes     and furrows, which ramify and extend into deep valleys, appear     like dried-up channels of streams and rivulets.
10136-8{_}9409{_}From time     immemorial, immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these     downs.
10136-8{_}9410{_}The herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious; and     whilst the natural healthiness of the climate, consequent on the     dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land, is     eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep, the     arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the Downs affords     the means of a supply of other food, when the natural produce of     the hills fails.
10136-8{_}9411{_}The mutton of the South-Down breed of sheep is     highly valued for its delicate flavour, and the wool for its     fineness; but the best specimens of this breed, when imported     from England into the West Indies, become miserably lean in the     course of a year or two, and their woolly fleece gives place to     a covering of short, crisp, brownish hair.
10136-8{_}9412{_}BROILED KIDNEYS (a Breakfast or Supper Dish).
10136-8{_}9413{_}724.
10136-8{_}9414{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sheep kidneys, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}9415{_}_Mode_.--Ascertain that the kidneys are fresh, and cut them open very evenly, lengthwise, down to the root, for should one half be thicker than the other, one would be underdone whilst the other would be dried, but do not separate them; skin them, and pass a skewer under the white part of each half to keep them flat, and broil over a nice clear fire, placing the inside downwards; turn them when done enough on one side, and cook them on the other.
10136-8{_}9416{_}Remove the skewers, place the kidneys on a very hot dish, season with pepper and salt, and put a tiny piece of butter in the middle of each; serve very hot and quickly, and send very hot plates to table.
10136-8{_}9417{_}_Time_.--6 to 8 minutes.

10136-8{_}9428{_}_Mode_.--Cut the kidneys open without quite dividing them, remove the skin, and put a small piece of butter in the frying-pan.
10136-8{_}9429{_}When the butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the flat side downwards, and fry them for 7 or 8 minutes, turning them when they are half-done.

10136-8{_}9438{_}726.
10136-8{_}9439{_}INGREDIENTS.--Haunch of mutton, a little salt, flour.
10136-8{_}9440{_}_Mode_.--Let this joint hang as long as possible without becoming tainted, and while hanging dust flour over it, which keeps off the flies, and prevents the air from getting to it.
10136-8{_}9441{_}If not well hung, the joint, when it comes to table, will neither do credit to the butcher or the cook, as it will not be tender.
10136-8{_}9442{_}Wash the outside well, lest it should have a bad flavour from keeping; then flour it and put it down to a nice brisk fire, at some distance, so that it may gradually warm through.
10136-8{_}9443{_}Keep continually basting, and about 1/2 hour before it is served, draw it nearer to the fire to get nicely brown.
10136-8{_}9444{_}Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat, pour off the dripping, add a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint.
10136-8{_}9445{_}Place a paper ruche on the bone, and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a tureen to table with it.

10136-8{_}9450{_}_Seasonable_.--In best season from September to March.
10136-8{_}9451{_}HOW TO BUY MEAT ECONOMICALLY.--If the housekeeper is not very     particular as to the precise joints to cook for dinner, there is     oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her     purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it.
10136-8{_}9452{_}It     often occurs, for instance, that the butcher may have a     superfluity of certain joints, and these he would be glad to get     rid of at a reduction of sometimes as much as 1d.
10136-8{_}9453{_}or 1-1/2d.
10136-8{_}9454{_}per     lb., and thus, in a joint of 8 or 9 lbs., will be saved enough     to buy 2 quartern loaves.
10136-8{_}9455{_}It frequently happens with many     butchers, that, in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of     mutton, they have only shoulders left, and these they will be     glad to sell at a reduction.

10136-8{_}9459{_}INGREDIENTS.--Leg of mutton, a little salt.
10136-8{_}9460{_}_Mode_.--As mutton, when freshly killed, is never tender, hang it almost as long as it will keep; flour it, and put it in a cool airy place for a few days, if the weather will permit.
10136-8{_}9461{_}Wash off the flour, wipe it very dry, and cut off the shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear fire, dredge with flour, and keep continually basting the whole time it is cooking.
10136-8{_}9462{_}About 20 minutes before serving, draw it near the fire to get nicely brown; sprinkle over it a little salt, dish the meat, pour off the dripping, add some boiling water slightly salted, strain it over the joint, and serve.
10136-8{_}9463{_}_Time_.--A leg of mutton weighing 10 lbs., about 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 hours; one of 7 lbs., about 2 hours, or rather less.
10136-8{_}9464{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}9465{_}per lb.

10136-8{_}9470{_}INGREDIENTS.--Loin of mutton, a little salt.
10136-8{_}9471{_}_Mode_.--Cut and trim off the superfluous fat, and see that the butcher joints the meat properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to the carver, when it comes to table.
10136-8{_}9472{_}Have ready a nice clear fire (it need not be a very wide large one), put down the meat, dredge with flour, and baste well until it is done.
10136-8{_}9473{_}Make the gravy as for roast leg of mutton, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}9474{_}[Illustration: LOIN OF MUTTON.]

10136-8{_}9484{_}417, 1 glass of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}9485{_}_Mode_.--Hang the mutton till tender, bone it, and sprinkle over it pepper, mace, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg in the above proportion, all of which must be pounded very fine.
10136-8{_}9486{_}Let it remain for a day, then make a forcemeat by recipe No.
10136-8{_}9487{_}417, cover the meat with it, and roll and bind it up firmly.
10136-8{_}9488{_}Half bake it in a slow oven, let it grow cold, take off the fat, and put the gravy into a stewpan; flour the meat, put it in the gravy, and stew it till perfectly tender.
10136-8{_}9489{_}Now take out the meat, unbind it, add to the gravy wine and ketchup as above, give one boil, and pour over the meat.
10136-8{_}9490{_}Serve with red-currant jelly; and, if obtainable, a few mushrooms stewed for a few minutes in the gravy, will be found a great improvement.
10136-8{_}9491{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to bake the meat, 1-1/2 hour to stew gently.
10136-8{_}9492{_}_Average cost_, 4s.

10136-8{_}9496{_}_Note_.--This joint will be found very nice if rolled and stuffed, as here directed, and plainly roasted.
10136-8{_}9497{_}It should be well basted, and served with a good gravy and currant jelly.
10136-8{_}9498{_}BOILED NECK OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9499{_}730.
10136-8{_}9500{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs.
10136-8{_}9501{_}of the middle, or best end of the neck of mutton; a little salt.
10136-8{_}9502{_}_Mode_.--Trim off a portion of the fat, should there be too much, and if it is to look particularly nice, the chine-bone should be sawn down, the ribs stripped halfway down, and the ends of the bones chopped off; this is, however, not necessary.
10136-8{_}9503{_}Put the meat into sufficient _boiling_ water to cover it; when it boils, add a little salt and remove all the scum.
10136-8{_}9504{_}Draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let the water get so cool that the finger may be borne in it; then simmer very _slowly_ and gently until the meat is done, which will be in about 1-1/2 hour, or rather more, reckoning from the time that it begins to simmer.
10136-8{_}9505{_}Serve with turnips and caper sauce, No.
10136-8{_}9506{_}382, and pour a little of it over the meat.
10136-8{_}9507{_}The turnips should be boiled with the mutton; and, when at hand, a few carrots will also be found an improvement.
10136-8{_}9508{_}These, however, if very large and thick, must be cut into long thinnish pieces, or they will not be sufficiently done by the time the mutton is ready.
10136-8{_}9509{_}Garnish the dish with carrots and turnips placed alternately round the mutton.
10136-8{_}9510{_}_Time_.--4 lbs.
10136-8{_}9511{_}of the neck of mutton, about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}9512{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2 d. per lb.

10136-8{_}9515{_}THE POETS ON SHEEP.--The keeping of flocks seems to have been     the first employment of mankind; and the most ancient sort of     poetry was probably pastoral.
10136-8{_}9516{_}The poem known as the Pastoral     gives a picture of the life of the simple shepherds of the     golden age, who are supposed to have beguiled their time in     singing.
10136-8{_}9517{_}In all pastorals, repeated allusions are made to the     "fleecy flocks," the "milk-white lambs," and "the tender ewes;"     indeed, the sheep occupy a position in these poems inferior only     to that of the shepherds who tend them.
10136-8{_}9518{_}The "nibbling sheep" has     ever been a favourite of the poets, and has supplied them with     figures and similes without end.
10136-8{_}9519{_}Shakspere frequently compares     men to sheep.
10136-8{_}9520{_}When Gloster rudely drives the lieutenant from the     side of Henry VI., the poor king thus touchingly speaks of his     helplessness;--        "So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf:        So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,        And next his throat, unto the butcher's knife."
10136-8{_}9521{_}In the "Two Gentlemen of Verona," we meet with the following     humorous comparison:--      "_Proteus_.
10136-8{_}9522{_}The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the     shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for wages     followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee;     therefore, thou art a sheep.
10136-8{_}9523{_}"_Speed_.
10136-8{_}9524{_}Such another proof will make me cry _baa_."
10136-8{_}9525{_}The descriptive poets give us some charming pictures of sheep.
10136-8{_}9526{_}Every one is familiar with the sheep-shearing scene in Thomson's     "Seasons:"--        "Heavy and dripping, to the breezy brow       Slow move the harmless race; where, as they spread       Their dwelling treasures to the sunny ray,       Inly disturb'd, and wond'ring what this wild       Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints       The country fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock,       Incessant bleatings run around the hills."
10136-8{_}9527{_}What an exquisite idea of stillness is conveyed in the     oft-quoted line from Gray's "Elegy:"--        "And drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold."
10136-8{_}9528{_}From Dyer's quaint poem of "The Fleece" we could cull a hundred     passages relating to sheep; but we have already exceeded our     space.
10136-8{_}9529{_}We cannot, however, close this brief notice of the     allusions that have been made to sheep by our poets, without     quoting a couple of verses from Robert Burns's "Elegy on Poor     Mailie," his only "pet _yowe_:"--        "Thro' a' the town she troll'd by him;       A lang half-mile she could descry him;       Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him.
10136-8{_}9530{_}She ran wi' speed;       A friend mair faithfu' ne'er cam' nigh him                   Than Mailie dead.
10136-8{_}9531{_}"I wat she was a sheep o' sense.
10136-8{_}9532{_}An' could behave hersel' wi' mense;       I'll say't, she never brak a fence,                   Thro' thievish greed.
10136-8{_}9533{_}Our bardie, lanely, keeps the spence,                   Sin' Mailie's dead."

10136-8{_}9618{_}WOOLLEN MANUFACTURES.--The distinction between hair and wool is     rather arbitrary than natural, consisting in the greater or less     degrees of fineness, softness and pliability of the fibres.
10136-8{_}9619{_}When the fibres possess these properties so far as to admit of     their being spun and woven into a texture sufficiently pliable     to be used as an article of dress, they are called wool.
10136-8{_}9620{_}The     sheep, llama, Angora goat, and the goat of Thibet, are the     animals from which most of the wool used in manufactures is     obtained.
10136-8{_}9621{_}The finest of all wools is that from the goat of     Thibet, of which the Cashmere shawls are made.
10136-8{_}9622{_}Of European     wools, the finest is that yielded by the Merino sheep, the     Spanish and Saxon breeds taking the precedence.
10136-8{_}9623{_}The Merino     sheep, as now naturalized in Australia, furnishes an excellent     fleece; but all varieties of sheep-wool, reared either in Europe     or Australia are inferior in softness of feel to that grown in     India, and to that of the llama of the Andes.
10136-8{_}9624{_}The best of our     British wools are inferior in fineness to any of the     above-mentioned, being nearly twelve times the thickness of the     finest Spanish merino; but for the ordinary purposes of the     manufacturer, they are unrivalled.
10136-8{_}9625{_}ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9626{_}[Illustration: SADDLE OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9627{_}738.
10136-8{_}9628{_}INGREDIENTS.--Saddle of mutton; a little salt.
10136-8{_}9629{_}_Mode_.--To insure this joint being tender, let it hang for ten days or a fortnight, if the weather permits.
10136-8{_}9630{_}Cut off the tail and flaps and trim away every part that has not indisputable pretensions to be eaten, and have the skin taken off and skewered on again.
10136-8{_}9631{_}Put it down to a bright, clear fire, and, when the joint has been cooking for an hour, remove the skin and dredge it with flour.
10136-8{_}9632{_}It should not be placed too near the fire, as the fat should not be in the slightest degree burnt.
10136-8{_}9633{_}Keep constantly basting, both before and after the skin is removed; sprinkle some salt over the joint.
10136-8{_}9634{_}Make a little gravy in the dripping-pan; pour it over the meat, which send to table with a tureen of made gravy and red-currant jelly.
10136-8{_}9635{_}_Time_.--A saddle of mutton weighing 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours; 14 lbs., 3-1/4 hours.

10136-8{_}9644{_}INGREDIENTS.--Shoulder of mutton; a little salt.
10136-8{_}9645{_}_Mode_.--Put the joint down to a bright, clear fire; flour it well, and keep continually basting.
10136-8{_}9646{_}About 1/4 hour before serving, draw it near the fire, that the outside may acquire a nice brown colour, but not sufficiently near to blacken the fat.
10136-8{_}9647{_}Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat, empty the dripping-pan of its contents, pour in a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint.
10136-8{_}9648{_}Onion sauce, or stewed Spanish onions, are usually sent to table with this dish, and sometimes baked potatoes.

10136-8{_}9655{_}THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.--James Hogg was perhaps the most     remarkable man that ever wore the _maud_ of a shepherd.
10136-8{_}9656{_}Under     the garb, aspect, and bearing of a rude peasant (and rude enough     he was in most of these things, even after no inconsiderable     experience of society), the world soon discovered a true poet.
10136-8{_}9657{_}He taught himself to write, by copying the letters of a printed     book as he lay watching his flock on the hillside, and believed     that he had reached the utmost pitch of his ambition when he     first found that his artless rhymes could touch the heart of the     ewe-milker who partook the shelter of his mantle during the     passing storm.
10136-8{_}9658{_}If "the shepherd" of Professor Wilson's "Noctes     Ambrosianae" may be taken as a true portrait of James Hogg, we     must admit that, for quaintness of humour, the poet of Ettrick     Forest had few rivals.
10136-8{_}9659{_}Sir Walter Scott said that Hogg's     thousand little touches of absurdity afforded him more     entertainment than the best comedy that ever set the pit in a     roar.
10136-8{_}9660{_}Among the written productions of the shepherd-poet, is an     account of his own experiences in sheep-tending, called "The     Shepherd's Calender."
10136-8{_}9661{_}This work contains a vast amount of useful     information upon sheep, their diseases, habits, and management.
10136-8{_}9662{_}The Ettrick Shepherd died in 1835.

10136-8{_}9710{_}SINGED SHEEP'S HEAD.--The village of Dudingston, which stands     "within a mile of Edinburgh town," was formerly celebrated for     this ancient and homely Scottish dish.
10136-8{_}9711{_}In the summer months,     many opulent citizens used to resort to this place to solace     themselves over singed sheep's heads, boiled or baked.
10136-8{_}9712{_}The sheep     fed upon the neighbouring hills were slaughtered at this     village, and the carcases were sent to town; but the heads were     left to be consumed in the place.
10136-8{_}9713{_}We are not aware whether the     custom of eating sheep's heads at Dudingston is still kept up by     the good folks of Edinburgh.

10136-8{_}9738{_}THE LAMB AS A SACRIFICE.--The number of lambs consumed in     sacrifices by the Hebrews must have been very considerable.
10136-8{_}9739{_}Two     lambs "of the first year" were appointed to be sacrificed daily     for the morning and evening sacrifice; and a lamb served as a     substitute for the first-born of unclean animals, such as the     ass, which could not be accepted as an offering to the Lord.
10136-8{_}9740{_}Every year, also, on the anniversary of the deliverance of the     children of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, every family was     ordered to sacrifice a lamb or kid, and to sprinkle some of its     blood upon the door-posts, in commemoration of the judgment of     God upon the Egyptians.
10136-8{_}9741{_}It was to be eaten roasted, with     unleavened bread and bitter herbs, in haste, with the loins     girded, the shoes on the feet, and the staff in the hand; and     whatever remained until the morning was to be burnt.
10136-8{_}9742{_}The sheep     was also used in the numerous special, individual, and national     sacrifices ordered by the Jewish law.
10136-8{_}9743{_}On extraordinary     occasions, vast quantities of sheep were sacrificed at once;     thus Solomon, on the completion of the temple, offered "sheep     and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."

10136-8{_}9750{_}Green peas, or stewed mushrooms, may be strewed over the meat, and will be found a very great improvement.

10136-8{_}9810{_}INGREDIENTS.--Lamb, a little salt.
10136-8{_}9811{_}_Mode_.--To obtain the flavour of lamb in perfection, it should not be long kept; time to cool is all that it requires; and though the meat may be somewhat thready, the juices and flavour will be infinitely superior to that of lamb that has been killed 2 or 3 days.
10136-8{_}9812{_}Make up the fire in good time, that it may be clear and brisk when the joint is put down.
10136-8{_}9813{_}Place it at a sufficient distance to prevent the fat from burning, and baste it constantly till the moment of serving.
10136-8{_}9814{_}Lamb should be very _thoroughly_ done without being dried up, and not the slightest appearance of red gravy should be visible, as in roast mutton: this rule is applicable to all young white meats.
10136-8{_}9815{_}Serve with a little gravy made in the dripping-pan, the same as for other roasts, and send to table with it a tureen of mint sauce, No.

10136-8{_}9817{_}A cut lemon, a small piece of fresh butter, and a little cayenne, should also be placed on the table, so that when the carver separates the shoulder from the ribs, they may be ready for his use; if, however, he should not be very expert, we would recommend that the cook should divide these joints nicely before coming to table.

10136-8{_}9942{_}[Illustration: HAUNCH OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9943{_}759.
10136-8{_}9944{_}A deep cut should, in the first place, be made quite down to the bone, across the knuckle-end of the joint, along the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}9945{_}This will let the gravy escape; and then it should be carved, in not too thick slices, along the whole length of the haunch, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3.
10136-8{_}9946{_}[Illustration: LEG OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9947{_}LEG OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9948{_}760.
10136-8{_}9949{_}This homely, but capital English joint, is almost invariably served at table as shown in the engraving.
10136-8{_}9950{_}The carving of it is not very difficult: the knife should be carried sharply down in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and slices taken from either side, as the guests may desire, some liking the knuckle-end, as well done, and others preferring the more underdone part.
10136-8{_}9951{_}The fat should be sought near the line 3 to 4.
10136-8{_}9952{_}Some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with the under-side uppermost, so as to get at the finely-grained meat lying under that part of the meat, known as the Pope's eye; but this is an extravagant fashion, and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical British housewives and housekeepers.
10136-8{_}9953{_}LOIN OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9954{_}[Illustration: LOIN OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9955{_}761.
10136-8{_}9956{_}There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other; that is, that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked.
10136-8{_}9957{_}This knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools; and no one but the butcher is supposed to have these.
10136-8{_}9958{_}If the bones be not well jointed, the carving of a loin of mutton is not a gracious business; whereas, if that has been attended to, it is an easy and untroublesome task.
10136-8{_}9959{_}The knife should be inserted at fig.
10136-8{_}9960{_}1, and after feeling your way between the bones, it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}9961{_}As there are some people who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it, the question as to their choice of this should be asked.
10136-8{_}9962{_}SADDLE OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9963{_}[Illustration: SADDLE OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9964{_}762.
10136-8{_}9965{_}Although we have heard, at various intervals, growlings expressed at the inevitable "saddle of mutton" at the dinner-parties of our middle classes, yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked, when it has been well hung and artistically cooked.
10136-8{_}9966{_}There is a diversity of opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table; but it has only reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail, or, if so, how many joints of the tail.
10136-8{_}9967{_}We ourselves prefer the mode as shown in our coloured illustration "O;" but others may, upon equally good grounds, like the way shown in the engraving on this page.
10136-8{_}9968{_}Some trim the tail with a paper frill.
10136-8{_}9969{_}The carving is not difficult: it is usually cut in the direction of the line from 2 to 1, quite down to the bones, in evenly-sliced pieces.
10136-8{_}9970{_}A fashion, however, patronized by some, is to carve it obliquely, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3; in which case the joint would be turned round the other way, having the tail end on the right of the carver.
10136-8{_}9971{_}SHOULDER OF MUTTON.
10136-8{_}9972{_}[Illustration: SHOULDER OF MUTTON.]
10136-8{_}9973{_}763.
10136-8{_}9974{_}This is a joint not difficult to carve.
10136-8{_}9975{_}The knife should be drawn from the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, until the bone of the shoulder is reached.
10136-8{_}9976{_}As many slices as can be carved in this manner should be taken, and afterwards the meat lying on either side of the blade-bone should be served, by carving in the direction of 3 to 4 and 3 to 4.
10136-8{_}9977{_}The uppermost side of the shoulder being now finished, the joint should be turned, and slices taken off along its whole length.
10136-8{_}9978{_}There are some who prefer this under-side of the shoulder for its juicy flesh, although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that on the other side.
10136-8{_}9979{_}FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.
10136-8{_}9980{_}[Illustration: FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.]
10136-8{_}9981{_}764.
10136-8{_}9982{_}We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this joint, for there is a little field for his judgment and dexterity which does not always occur.
10136-8{_}9983{_}The separation of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to; this is done by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, into which the fork should be firmly fixed, it will come away with just a little more exercise of the knife.
10136-8{_}9984{_}In dividing the shoulder and breast, the carver should take care not to cut away too much of the meat from the latter, as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed.
10136-8{_}9985{_}The breast and shoulder being separated, it is usual to lay a small piece of butter, and sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt between them; and when this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy, the shoulder may, as more convenient, be removed into another dish.
10136-8{_}9986{_}The, next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket, by cutting through the meat on the line 5 to 6.
10136-8{_}9987{_}The joint is then ready to be served to the guests; the ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from 9 to 10, and the brisket from 7 to 8.
10136-8{_}9988{_}The carver should ask those at the table what parts they prefer-ribs, brisket, or a piece of the shoulder.
10136-8{_}9989{_}LEG OF LAMB, LOIN OF LAMB, SADDLE OF LAMB, SHOULDER OF LAMB,  are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton.

10136-8{_}9992{_}[Illustration]  CHAPTER XVI.
10136-8{_}9993{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMMON HOG.
10136-8{_}9994{_}765.
10136-8{_}9995{_}THE HOG belongs to the order _Mammalia_, the genus _Sus scrofa_, and the species _Pachydermata_, or thick-skinned; and its generic characters are, a small head, with long flexible snout truncated; 42 teeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors, projecting, 2 upper and 2 lower canine, or tusks,--the former short, the latter projecting, formidable, and sharp, and 14 molars in each jaw; cloven feet furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted; while, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting.
10136-8{_}9996{_}766.
10136-8{_}9997{_}FROM THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF THE TEETH, physiologists are enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal; and from those of the _Sus_, or hog, it is evident that he is as much a _grinder_ as a _biter_, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system.
10136-8{_}9998{_}767.
10136-8{_}9999{_}THUS THE PIG TRIBE, though not a ruminating mammal, as might be inferred from the number of its molar teeth, is yet a link between the _herbivorous_ and the _carnivorous_ tribes, and is consequently what is known as an _omnivorous_ quadruped; or, in other words, capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment.
10136-8{_}10000{_}768.
10136-8{_}10001{_}THOUGH THE HOOF IN THE HOG is, as a general rule, cloven, there are several remarkable exceptions, as in the species native to Norway, Illyria, Sardinia, and _formerly_ to the Berkshire variety of the British domesticated pig, in which the hoof is entire and _un_cleft.
10136-8{_}10002{_}769.
10136-8{_}10003{_}WHATEVER DIFFERENCE IN ITS PHYSICAL NATURE, climate and soil may produce in this animal, his functional characteristics are the same in whatever part of the world he may be found; and whether in the trackless forests of South America, the coral isles of Polynesia, the jungles of India, or the spicy brakes of Sumatra, he is everywhere known for his gluttony, laziness, and indifference to the character and quality of his food.
10136-8{_}10004{_}And though he occasionally shows an epicure's relish for a succulent plant or a luscious carrot, which he will discuss with all his salivary organs keenly excited, he will, the next moment, turn with equal gusto to some carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of the unscrupulous cormorant.
10136-8{_}10005{_}It is this coarse and repulsive mode of feeding that has, in every country and language, obtained for him the opprobrium of being "an unclean animal."
10136-8{_}10006{_}770.
10136-8{_}10007{_}IN THE MOSAICAL LAW, the pig is condemned as an unclean beast, and consequently interdicted to the Israelites, as unfit for human food.
10136-8{_}10008{_}"And the swine, though he divideth the hoof and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud.
10136-8{_}10009{_}He is unclean to you."--Lev.
10136-8{_}10010{_}xi.
10136-8{_}10011{_}7.
10136-8{_}10012{_}Strict, however, as the law was respecting the cud-chewing and hoof-divided animals, the Jews, with their usual perversity and violation of the divine commands, seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition; for, unless they ate pork, it is difficult to conceive for what purpose they kept troves of swine, as from the circumstance recorded in Matthew xviii.
10136-8{_}10013{_}32, when Jesus was in Galilee, and the devils, cast out of the two men, were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding on the hills in the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias, it is very evident they did.
10136-8{_}10014{_}There is only one interpretation by which we can account for a prohibition that debarred the Jews from so many foods which we regard as nutritious luxuries, that, being fat and the texture more hard of digestion than other meats, they were likely, in a hot dry climate, where vigorous exercise could seldom be taken, to produce disease, and especially cutaneous affections; indeed, in this light, as a code of sanitary ethics, the book of Leviticus is the most admirable system of moral government ever conceived for man's benefit.
10136-8{_}10015{_}771.
10136-8{_}10016{_}SETTING HIS COARSE FEEDING AND SLOVENLY HABITS OUT OF THE QUESTION, there is no domestic animal so profitable or so useful to man as the much-maligned pig, or any that yields him a more varied or more luxurious repast.
10136-8{_}10017{_}The prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary, even under the restraint of domestication; but when left to run wild in favourable situations, as in the islands of the South Pacific, the result, in a few years, from two animals put on shore and left undisturbed, is truly surprising; for they breed so fast, and have such numerous litters, that unless killed off in vast numbers both for the use of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions for ships' crews, they would degenerate into vermin.
10136-8{_}10018{_}In this country the pig has usually two litters, or farrows, in a year, the breeding seasons being April and October; and the period the female goes with her young is about four months,--16 weeks or 122 days.
10136-8{_}10019{_}The number produced at each litter depends upon the character of the breed; 12 being the average number in the small variety, and 10 in the large; in the mixed breeds, however, the average is between 10 and 15, and in some instances has reached as many as 20.
10136-8{_}10020{_}But however few, or however many, young pigs there may be to the farrow, there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle, a poor, little, shrivelled, half-starved anatomy, with a small melancholy voice, a staggering gait, a woe-begone countenance, and a thread of a tail, whose existence the complacent mother ignores, his plethoric brothers and sisters repudiate, and for whose emaciated jaws there is never a spare or supplemental teat, till one of the favoured gormandizers, overtaken by momentary oblivion, drops the lacteal fountain, and gives the little squeaking straggler the chance of a momentary mouthful.
10136-8{_}10021{_}This miserable little object, which may be seen bringing up the rear of every litter, is called the Tony pig, or the _Anthony_; so named, it is presumed, from being the one always assigned to the Church, when tithe was taken in kind; and as St. Anthony was the patron of husbandry, his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to the starveling that constituted his dues; for whether there are ten or fifteen farrows to the litter, the Anthony is always the last of the family to come into the world.
10136-8{_}10022{_}772.
10136-8{_}10023{_}FROM THE GROSSNESS OF HIS FEEDING, the large amount of aliment he consumes, his gluttonous way of eating it, from his slothful habits, laziness, and indulgence in sleep, the pig is particularly liable to disease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the skin.
10136-8{_}10024{_}773.
10136-8{_}10025{_}TO COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A VIOLATION OF THE PHYSICAL LAWS, a powerful monitor in the brain of the pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine.
10136-8{_}10026{_}To open the pores of his skin, blocked up with mud, and excite perspiration, he resorts to a tree, a stump, or his trough--anything rough and angular, and using it as a curry-comb to his body, obtains the luxury of a scratch and the benefit of cuticular evaporation; he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub up antiscorbutic roots, cooling salads of mallow and dandelion, and, greatest treat of all, he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of delicious cinder, which, he knows by instinct, is the most sovereign remedy in the world for that hot, unpleasant sensation he has had all the morning at his stomach.
10136-8{_}10027{_}774.
10136-8{_}10028{_}IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT that, though every one who keeps a pig knows how prone he is to disease, how that disease injures the quality of the meat, and how eagerly he pounces on a bit of coal or cinder, or any coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which he lives, and by affording soda to his system, correct the vitiated fluids of his body,--yet very few have the judgment to act on what they see, and by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls of cinders in his sty, save the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health.
10136-8{_}10029{_}Instead of this, however, and without supplying the animal with what its instinct craves for, his nostril is bored with a red-hot iron, and a ring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting for what he feels to be absolutely necessary for his health; and ignoring the fact that, in a domestic state at least, the pig lives on the richest of all food,--scraps of cooked animal substances, boiled vegetables, bread, and other items, given in that concentrated essence of aliment for a quadruped called wash, and that he eats to repletion, takes no exercise, and finally sleeps all the twenty-four hours he is not eating, and then, when the animal at last seeks for those medicinal aids which would obviate the evil of such a forcing diet, his keeper, instead of meeting his animal instinct by human reason, and giving him what he seeks, has the inhumanity to torture him by a ring, that, keeping up a perpetual "raw" in the pig's snout, prevents his digging for those corrective drugs which would remove the evils of his artificial existence.
10136-8{_}10030{_}775.
10136-8{_}10031{_}THOUGH SUBJECT TO SO MANY DISEASES, no domestic animal is more easily kept in health, cleanliness, and comfort, and this without the necessity of "ringing," or any excessive desire of the hog to roam, break through his sty, or plough up his _pound_.
10136-8{_}10032{_}Whatever the kind of food may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened, a teaspoonful or more of salt should always be given in his mess of food, and a little heap of well-burnt cinders, with occasional bits of chalk, should always be kept by the side of his trough, as well as a vessel of clean water: his pound, or the front part of his sty, should be totally free from straw, the brick flooring being every day swept out and sprinkled with a layer of sand.
10136-8{_}10033{_}His lair, or sleeping apartment, should be well sheltered by roof and sides from cold, wet, and all changes of weather, and the bed made up of a good supply of clean straw, sufficiently deep to enable the pig to burrow his unprotected body beneath it.
10136-8{_}10034{_}All the refuse of the garden, in the shape of roots, leaves, and stalks, should be placed in a corner of his pound or feeding-chamber, for the delectation of his leisure moments; and once a week, on the family washing-day, a pail of warm soap-suds should be taken into his sty, and, by means of a scrubbing-brush and soap, his back, shoulders, and flanks should be well cleaned, a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at the conclusion, before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry himself.
10136-8{_}10035{_}By this means, the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be corrected, a more perfect digestion insured, and, by opening the pores of the skin, a more vigorous state of health acquired than could have been obtained under any other system.
10136-8{_}10036{_}776.
10136-8{_}10037{_}WE HAVE ALREADY SAID that no other animal yields man so _many_ kinds and varieties of luxurious food as is supplied to him by the flesh of the hog differently prepared; for almost every part of the animal, either fresh, salted, or dried, is used for food; and even those viscera not so employed are of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view.
10136-8{_}10038{_}777.
10136-8{_}10039{_}THOUGH DESTITUTE OF THE HIDE, HORNS, AND HOOFS, constituting the offal of most domestic animals, the pig is not behind the other mammalia in its usefulness to man.
10136-8{_}10040{_}Its skin, especially that of the boar, from its extreme closeness of texture, when tanned, is employed for the seats of saddles, to cover powder, shot, and drinking-flasks; and the hair, according to its colour, flexibility, and stubbornness, is manufactured into tooth, nail, and hairbrushes,--others into hat, clothes, and shoe-brushes; while the longer and finer qualities are made into long and short brooms and painters' brushes; and a still more rigid description, under the name of "bristles," are used by the shoemaker as needles for the passage of his wax-end.
10136-8{_}10041{_}Besides so many benefits and useful services conferred on man by this valuable animal, his fat, in a commercial sense, is quite as important as his flesh, and brings a price equal to the best joints in the carcase.
10136-8{_}10042{_}This fat is rendered, or melted out of the caul, or membrane in which it is contained, by boiling water, and, while liquid, run into prepared bladders, when, under the name of _lard_, it becomes an article of extensive trade and value.
10136-8{_}10043{_}778.
10136-8{_}10044{_}OF THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF THE DOMESTICATED HOG, the following list of breeds may be accepted as the best, presenting severally all those qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic stock, as affecting both the breeder and the consumer.
10136-8{_}10045{_}_Native_--Berkshire, Essex, York, and Cumberland; _Foreign_--the Chinese.
10136-8{_}10046{_}Before, however, proceeding with the consideration of the different orders, in the series we have placed them, it will be necessary to make a few remarks relative to the pig generally.
10136-8{_}10047{_}In the first place, the _Black Pig_ is regarded by breeders as the best and most eligible animal, not only from the fineness and delicacy of the skin, but because it is less affected by the heat in summer, and far less subject to cuticular disease than either the white or brindled hog, but more particularly from its kindlier nature and greater aptitude to fatten.
10136-8{_}10048{_}779.
10136-8{_}10049{_}THE GREAT QUALITY FIRST SOUGHT FOR IN A HOG is a capacious stomach, and next, a healthy power of digestion; for the greater the quantity he can eat, and the more rapidly he can digest what he has eaten, the more quickly will he fatten; and the faster he can be made to increase in flesh, without a material increase of bone, the better is the breed considered, and the more valuable the animal.
10136-8{_}10050{_}In the usual order of nature, the development of flesh and enlargement of bone proceed together; but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by the quicker development of their fleshy covering.
10136-8{_}10051{_}780.
10136-8{_}10052{_}THE CHIEF POINTS SOUGHT FOR IN THE CHOICE OF A HOG are breadth of chest, depth of carcase, width of loin, chine, and ribs, compactness of form, docility, cheerfulness, and general beauty of appearance.
10136-8{_}10053{_}The head in a well-bred hog must not be too long, the forehead narrow and convex, cheeks full, snout fine, mouth small, eyes small and quick, ears short, thin, and sharp, pendulous, and pointing forwards; neck full and broad, particularly on the top, where it should join very broad shoulders; the ribs, loin, and haunch should be in a uniform line, and the tail well set, neither too high nor too low; at the same time the back is to be straight or slightly curved, the chest deep, broad, and prominent, the legs short and thick; the belly, when well fattened, should nearly touch the ground, the hair be long, thin, fine, and having few bristles, and whatever the colour, uniform, either white, black, or blue; but not spotted, speckled, brindled, or sandy.
10136-8{_}10054{_}Such are the features and requisites that, among breeders and judges, constitute the _beau idéal_ of a perfect pig.
10136-8{_}10055{_}[Illustration: BERKSHIRE SOW.]
10136-8{_}10056{_}781.
10136-8{_}10057{_}THE BERKSHIRE PIG IS THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST ESTEEMED of all our English domestic breeds, and so highly is it regarded, that even the varieties of the stock are in as great estimation as the parent breed itself.
10136-8{_}10058{_}The characteristics of the Berkshire hog are that it has a tawny colour, spotted with black, large ears hanging over the eyes, a thick, close, and well-made body, legs short and small in the bone; feeds up to a great weight, fattens quickly, and is good either for pork or bacon.
10136-8{_}10059{_}The New or Improved Berkshire possesses all the above qualities, but is infinitely more prone to fatten, while the objectionable colour has been entirely done away with, being now either all white or completely black.
10136-8{_}10060{_}[Illustration: ESSEX SOW.]
10136-8{_}10061{_}782.
10136-8{_}10062{_}NEXT TO THE FORMER, THE ESSEX takes place in public estimation, always competing, and often successfully, with the Berkshire.
10136-8{_}10063{_}The peculiar characters of the Essex breed are that it is tip-eared, has a long sharp head, is roach-backed, with a long flat body, standing high on the legs; is rather bare of hair, is a quick feeder, has an enormous capacity of stomach and belly, and an appetite to match its receiving capability.
10136-8{_}10064{_}Its colour is white, or else black and white, and it has a restless habit and an unquiet disposition.
10136-8{_}10065{_}The present valuable stock has sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the White Chinese or Black Neapolitan breeds.
10136-8{_}10066{_}[Illustration: YORKSHIRE SOW.]
10136-8{_}10067{_}783.
10136-8{_}10068{_}THE YORKSHIRE, CALLED ALSO THE OLD LINCOLNSHIRE, was at one time the largest stock of the pig family in England, and perhaps, at that time, the worst.
10136-8{_}10069{_}It was long-legged, weak in the loins, with coarse white curly hair, and flabby flesh.
10136-8{_}10070{_}Now, however, it has undergone as great a change as any breed in the kingdom, and by judicious crossing has become the most valuable we possess, being a very well-formed pig throughout, with a good head, a pleasant docile countenance, with moderate-sized drooping ears, a broad back, slightly curved, large chine and loins, with deep sides, full chest, and well covered with long thickly-set white hairs.
10136-8{_}10071{_}Besides these qualities of form, he is a quick grower, feeds fast, and will easily make from 20 to 25 stone before completing his first year.
10136-8{_}10072{_}The quality of the meat is also uncommonly good, the fat and lean being laid on in almost equal proportions.
10136-8{_}10073{_}So capable is this species of development, both in flesh and stature, that examples of the Yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as much as a Scotch ox.
10136-8{_}10074{_}[Illustration: CUMBERLAND SOW.]
10136-8{_}10075{_}784.
10136-8{_}10076{_}THOUGH ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN ENGLAND can boast some local variety or other of this useful animal, obtained from the native stock by crossing with some of the foreign kinds, Cumberland and the north-west parts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white pigs, with a thick, compact, and well-made body, short in the legs, the head and back well formed, ears slouching and a little downwards, and on the whole, a hardy, profitable animal, and one well disposed to fatten.
10136-8{_}10077{_}785.
10136-8{_}10078{_}THERE IS NO VARIETY OF THIS USEFUL ANIMAL that presents such peculiar features as the species known to us as the Chinese pig; and as it is the general belief that to this animal and the Neapolitan hog we are indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place in the breeds of the English pig, it is necessary to be minute in the description of this, in all respects, singular animal.
10136-8{_}10079{_}The Chinese, in the first place, consists of many varieties, and presents as many forms of body as differences of colour; the best kind, however, has a beautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy; the hair too is perfectly white, and thinly set over the body, with here and there a few bristles.
10136-8{_}10080{_}He has a broad snout, short head, eyes bright and fiery, very small fine pink ears, wide cheeks, high chine, with a neck of such immense thickness, that when the animal is fat it looks like an elongated carcase,--a mass of fat, without shape or form, like a feather pillow.
10136-8{_}10081{_}The belly is dependent, and almost trailing on the ground, the legs very short, and the tail so small as to be little more than a rudiment.
10136-8{_}10082{_}It has a ravenous appetite, and will eat anything that the wonderful assimilating powers of its stomach can digest; and to that capability, there seems no limit in the whole range of animal or vegetable nature.
10136-8{_}10083{_}The consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid digestion is an unprecedented proneness to obesity, a process of fattening that, once commenced, goes on with such rapid development, that, in a short time, it loses all form, depositing such an amount of fat, that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal, and, beyond the hair on its back and the callous extremity of the snout, _the whole carcase is eatable_.
10136-8{_}10084{_}[Illustration: CHINESE SOW.]
10136-8{_}10085{_}786.
10136-8{_}10086{_}WHEN JUDICIOUSLY FED ON VEGETABLE DIET, and this obese tendency checked, the flesh of the Chinese pig is extremely delicate and delicious; but when left to gorge almost exclusively on animal food, it becomes oily, coarse, and unpleasant.
10136-8{_}10087{_}Perhaps there is no other instance in nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well shown as in this animal, which thrives on _everything_, and turns to the benefit of its physical economy, food of the most _opposite nature_, and of the most unwholesome and _offensive_ character.
10136-8{_}10088{_}When fully fattened, the thin cuticle, that is one of its characteristics, cracks, from the adipose distension beneath, exposing the fatty mass, which discharges a liquid oil from the adjacent tissues.
10136-8{_}10089{_}The great fault in this breed is the remarkably small quantity of lean laid down, to the immense proportion of fat.
10136-8{_}10090{_}Some idea of the growth of this species may be inferred from the fact of their attaining to 18 stone before two years, and when further advanced, as much as 40 stone.
10136-8{_}10091{_}In its pure state, except for roasters, the Chinese pig is too disproportionate for the English market; but when crossed with some of our lean stock, the breed becomes almost invaluable.
10136-8{_}10092{_}[Illustration: WESTPHALIAN BOAR.]
10136-8{_}10093{_}787.
10136-8{_}10094{_}THE WILD BOAR is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the domesticated hog; he is longer in the snout, has his ears shorter and his tusks considerably longer, very frequently measuring as much as 10 inches.
10136-8{_}10095{_}They are extremely sharp, and are bent in an upward circle.
10136-8{_}10096{_}Unlike his domestic brother, who roots up here and there, or wherever his fancy takes, the wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or furrows.
10136-8{_}10097{_}The boar, when selected as the parent of a stock, should have a small head, be deep and broad in the chest; the chine should be arched, the ribs and barrel well rounded, with the haunches falling full down nearly to the hock; and he should always be more compact and smaller than the female.
10136-8{_}10098{_}The colour of the wild boar is always of a uniform hue, and generally of an iron grey; shading off into a black.
10136-8{_}10099{_}The hair of the boar is of considerable length, especially about the head and mane; he stands, in general, from 20 to 30 inches in height at the shoulders, though instances have occurred where he has reached 42 inches.
10136-8{_}10100{_}The young are of a pale yellowish tint, irregularly brindled with light brown.
10136-8{_}10101{_}The boar of Germany is a large and formidable animal, and the hunting of him, with a small species of mastiff, is still a national sport.
10136-8{_}10102{_}From living almost exclusively on acorns and nuts, his flesh is held in great esteem, and in Westphalia his legs are made into hams by a process which, it is said, enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a remarkable degree.
10136-8{_}10103{_}788.
10136-8{_}10104{_}THERE ARE TWO POINTS to be taken into consideration by all breeders of pigs--to what ultimate use is the flesh to be put; for, if meant to be eaten fresh, or simply salted, the _small_ breed of pigs is host suited for the purpose; if for hams or bacon, the large variety of the animal is necessary.
10136-8{_}10105{_}Pigs are usually weaned between six and eight weeks after birth, after which they are fed on soft food, such as mashed potatoes in skimmed or butter-milk.
10136-8{_}10106{_}The general period at which the small hogs are killed for the market is from 12 to 16 weeks; from 4 to 5 mouths, they are called store pigs, and are turned out to graze till the animal has acquired its full stature.
10136-8{_}10107{_}As soon as this point has been reached, the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly as possible; he should therefore be taken from the fields and farm-yard, and shut up on boiled potatoes, buttermilk, and peas-meal, after a time to be followed by grains, oil-cake, wash, barley, and Indian meal; supplying his sty at the same time with plenty of water, cinders, and a quantity of salt in every mess of food presented to him.
10136-8{_}10108{_}789.
10136-8{_}10109{_}THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PIGS IN GREAT BRITAIN is supposed to exceed 20 millions; and, considering the third of the number as worth £2 apiece, and the remaining two-thirds as of the relative value of _10s_.
10136-8{_}10110{_}each, would give a marketable estimate of over £20,000,000 for this animal alone.
10136-8{_}10111{_}790.
10136-8{_}10112{_}THE BEST AND MOST HUMANE MODE OF KILLING ALL LARGE HOGS is to strike them down like a bullock, with the pointed end of a poleaxe, on the forehead, which has the effect of killing the animal at once; all the butcher has then to do, is to open the aorta and great arteries, and laying the animal's neck over a trough, let out the blood as quickly as possible.
10136-8{_}10113{_}The carcase is then to be scalded, either on a board or by immersion in a tub of very hot water, and all the hair and dirt rapidly scraped off, till the skin is made perfectly white, when it is hung up, opened, and dressed, as it is called, in the usual way.
10136-8{_}10114{_}It is then allowed to cool, a sheet being thrown around the carcase, to prevent the air from discolouring the newly-cleaned skin.
10136-8{_}10115{_}When meant for bacon, the hair is singed instead of being scalded off.
10136-8{_}10116{_}791.
10136-8{_}10117{_}IN THE COUNTRY, where for ordinary consumption the pork killed for sale is usually both larger and fatter than that supplied to the London consumer, it is customary to remove the skin and fat down to the lean, and, salting that, roast what remains of the joint.
10136-8{_}10118{_}Pork goes further, and is consequently a more economical food than other meats, simply because the texture is closer, and there is less waste in the cooking, either in roasting or boiling.
10136-8{_}10119{_}792.
10136-8{_}10120{_}IN FRESH PORK, the leg is the most economical family joint, and the loin the richest.
10136-8{_}10121{_}793.
10136-8{_}10122{_}COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING, very little difference exists between the weight of the live and dead pig, and this, simply because there is neither the head nor the hide to be removed.
10136-8{_}10123{_}It has been proved that pork loses in cooking 13-1/2, per cent.
10136-8{_}10124{_}of its weight.
10136-8{_}10125{_}A salted hand weighing 4 lbs.
10136-8{_}10126{_}5 oz.
10136-8{_}10127{_}lost in the cooking 11 oz.
10136-8{_}10128{_}; after cooking, the meat weighing only 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10129{_}1 oz., and the bone 9 oz.
10136-8{_}10130{_}The original cost was 7-1/2d.
10136-8{_}10131{_}a pound; but by this deduction, the cost rose to 9d.
10136-8{_}10132{_}per pound with the bone, and 10-1/4d.
10136-8{_}10133{_}without it.
10136-8{_}10134{_}794.
10136-8{_}10135{_}PORK, TO BE PRESERVED, is cured in several ways,--either by covering it with salt, or immersing it in ready-made brine, where it is kept till required; or it is only partially salted, and then hung up to dry, when the meat is called white bacon; or, after salting, it is hung in wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated with the aroma from the wood.
10136-8{_}10136{_}The Wiltshire bacon, which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom, is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden troughs, and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered bay-salt, made hot in a frying-pan.
10136-8{_}10137{_}This process is repeated for four days; they are then left for three weeks, merely turning the flitches every other day.
10136-8{_}10138{_}After that time they are hung up to dry.
10136-8{_}10139{_}The hogs usually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from 18 to 20 stone; on the other hand, the hogs killed in the country for farm-house purposes, seldom weigh less than 26 stone.
10136-8{_}10140{_}The legs of boars, hogs, and, in Germany, those of bears, are prepared differently, and called hams.
10136-8{_}10141{_}795.
10136-8{_}10142{_}THE PRACTICE IN VOGUE FORMERLY in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately; then to remove the ribs, which were roasted as "spare-ribs," and, curing the remainder of the side, call it a "gammon of bacon."
10136-8{_}10143{_}Small pork to cut for table in joints, is cut up, in most places throughout the kingdom, as represented in the engraving.
10136-8{_}10144{_}The sale is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter; and the following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters:--                   1.
10136-8{_}10145{_}The leg.

10136-8{_}10157{_}The weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be as follows; viz.
10136-8{_}10158{_}:--    The leg                        8 lbs.
10136-8{_}10159{_}The loin and spring            7 lbs.
10136-8{_}10160{_}The hand                       6 lbs.
10136-8{_}10161{_}The chine                      7 lbs.
10136-8{_}10162{_}The cheek            from 2 to 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10163{_}Of a bacon pig, the legs are reserved for curing, and when cured are called hams: when the meat is separated from the shoulder-blade and bones and cured, it is called bacon.
10136-8{_}10164{_}The bones, with part of the meat left on them, are divided into spare-ribs, griskins, and chines.

10136-8{_}10166{_}PORK CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}10167{_}796.
10136-8{_}10168{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast loin of pork, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}10169{_}of butter, 2 onions, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar and mustard.
10136-8{_}10170{_}_Mode_.--Cut the pork into nice-sized cutlets, trim off most of the fat, and chop the onions.
10136-8{_}10171{_}Put the butter into a stewpan, lay in the cutlets and chopped onions, and fry a light brown; then add the remaining ingredients, simmer gently for 5 or 7 minutes, and serve.
10136-8{_}10172{_}_Time_.--5 to 7 minutes.
10136-8{_}10173{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.

10136-8{_}10175{_}AUSTRIAN METHOD OF HERDING PIGS.--In the Austrian empire there     are great numbers of wild swine, while, among the wandering     tribes peopling the interior of Hungary, and spreading over the     vast steppes of that country, droves of swine form a great     portion of the wealth of the people, who chiefly live on a     coarse bread and wind-dried bacon.
10136-8{_}10176{_}In German Switzerland, the Tyrol, and other mountainous     districts of continental Europe, though the inhabitants, almost     everywhere, as in England, keep one or more pigs, they are at     little or no trouble in feeding them, one or more men being     employed by one or several villages as swine-herds; who, at a     certain hour, every morning, call for the pig or pigs, and     driving them to their feeding-grounds on the mountain-side and     in the wood, take custody of the herd till, on the approach of     night, they are collected into a compact body and driven home     for a night's repose in their several sties.
10136-8{_}10177{_}The amount of intelligence and docility displayed by the pigs in     these mountain regions, is much more considerable than that     usually allowed to this animal, and the manner in which these     immense herds of swine are collected, and again distributed,     without an accident or mistake, is a sight both curious and     interesting; for it is all done without the assistance of a dog,     or the aid even of the human voice, and solely by the crack of     the long-lashed and heavily-loaded whip, which the swine-herd     carries, and cracks much after the fashion of the French     postilion; and which, though he frequently cracks, waking a     hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks, he seldom has to     use correctionally; the animal soon acquiring a thorough     knowledge of the meaning of each crack; and once having felt its     leaded thong, a lasting remembrance of its power.
10136-8{_}10178{_}At early dawn,     the swine-herd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first     village, and begins flourishing through the misty air his     immensely long lash, keeping a sort of rude time with the crack,     crack, crack, crack, crack, crack of his whip.
10136-8{_}10179{_}The nearest pigs,     hearing the well-remembered sound, rouse from their straw, and     rush from their sties into the road, followed by all their     litters.
10136-8{_}10180{_}As soon as a sufficient number are collected, the drove     is set in motion, receiving, right and left, as they advance,     fresh numbers; whole communities, or solitary individuals,     streaming in from all quarters, and taking their place, without     distinction, in the general herd; and, as if conscious where     their breakfast lay, without wasting a moment on idle     investigation, all eagerly push on to the mountains.
10136-8{_}10181{_}In this     manner village after village is collected, till the drove not     unfrequently consists of several thousands.
10136-8{_}10182{_}The feeding-ground     has, of course, often to be changed, and the drove have     sometimes to be driven many miles, and to a considerable height     up the mountain, before the whip gives the signal for the     dispersion of the body and the order to feed, when the herdsman     proceeds to form himself a shelter, and look after his own     comfort for the rest of the day.
10136-8{_}10183{_}As soon as twilight sets in,     the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster; and in     the same order in which they were collected, the swine are     driven back, each group tailing off to its respective sty, as     the herd approaches the villages, till the last grunter, having     found his home, the drover seeks his cottage and repose.

10136-8{_}10242{_}ENGLISH MODE OF HUNTING, AND INDIAN PIG-STICKING.--The hunting     of the wild boar has been in all times, and in all countries, a     pastime of the highest interest and excitement, and from the age     of Nimrod, has only been considered second to the more dangerous     sport of lion-hunting.
10136-8{_}10243{_}The buried treasures of Nineveh, restored     to us by Mr. Layard, show us, on their sculptured annals, the     kings of Assyria in their royal pastime of boar-hunting.
10136-8{_}10244{_}That     the Greeks were passionately attached to this sport, we know     both from history and the romantic fables of the poets.
10136-8{_}10245{_}Marc     Antony, at one of his breakfasts with Cleopatra, had _eight wild     boars_ roasted whole; and though the Romans do not appear to     have been addicted to hunting, wild-boar fights formed part of     their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre.
10136-8{_}10246{_}In France,     Germany, and Britain, from the earliest time, the boar-hunt     formed one of the most exciting of sports; but it was only in     this country that the sport was conducted without dogs,--a real     hand-to-hand contest of man and beast; the hunter, armed only     with a boar-spear, a weapon about four feet long, the ash staff,     guarded by plates of steel, and terminating in a long, narrow,     and very sharp blade: this, with a hunting-knife, or hanger,     completed his offensive arms.
10136-8{_}10247{_}Thus equipped, the hunter would     either encounter his enemy face to face, confront his desperate     charge, as with erect tail, depressed head, and flaming eyes, he     rushed with his foamy tusks full against him, who either sought     to pierce his vitals through his counter, or driving his spear     through his chine, transfix his heart; or failing those more     difficult aims, plunge it into his flank, and, without     withdrawing the weapon, strike his ready hanger into his throat.
10136-8{_}10248{_}But expert as the hunter might be, it was not often the     formidable brute was so quickly dispatched; for he would     sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth, and nip it off     like a reed, or, coming full tilt on his enemy, by his momentum     and weight bear him to the earth, ripping up, with a horrid     gash, his leg or side, and before the writhing hunter could draw     his knife, the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the     wound, and rip, with savage teeth, the bowels of his victim.
10136-8{_}10249{_}At     other times, he would suddenly swerve from his charge, and     doubling on his opponent, attack the hunter in the rear.
10136-8{_}10250{_}From     his speed, great weight, and savage disposition, the wild boar     is always a dangerous antagonist, and requires great courage,     coolness, and agility on the part of the hunter.
10136-8{_}10251{_}The continental     sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade, with music and     dogs,--a kind of small hound or mastiff, and leaving all the     honorary part of the contest to them, when the boar is becoming     weary, and while beset by the dogs, rides up, and drives his     lance home in the beast's back or side.
10136-8{_}10252{_}Boar-hunting has been     for some centuries obsolete in England, the animal no longer     existing in a wild state among us; but in our Indian empire, and     especially in Bengal, the pastime is pursued by our countrymen     with all the daring of the national character; and as the animal     which inhabits the cane-brakes and jungles is a formidable foe,     the sport is attended with great excitement.
10136-8{_}10253{_}The hunters,     mounted on small, active horses, and armed only with long     lances, ride, at early daylight, to the skirts of the jungle,     and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover, wait till     the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes, when     chase is immediately given, till he is come up with, and     transfixed by the first weapon.
10136-8{_}10254{_}Instead of flight, however, he     often turns to bay, and by more than one dead horse and wounded     hunter, shows how formidable he is, and what those polished     tusks, sharp as pitch-forks, can effect, when the enraged animal     defends his life.

10136-8{_}10309{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10310{_}of coarse sugar, 1-1/2 lb.

10136-8{_}10316{_}_Sufficient_.--The above quantity of salt for 1 pig.
10136-8{_}10317{_}HOW PIGS WERE FORMERLY PASTURED AND FED.--Though unquestionably     far greater numbers of swine are now kept in England than     formerly, every peasant having one or more of that useful     animal, in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the     franklings and barons; in those days the swine-herds being a     regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household,     their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the     castle-yard, or outlying farm, to the nearest woods, chase, or     forest, where the frankling or vavasour had, either by right or     grant, what was called _free warren_, or the liberty to feed his     hogs off the acorns, beech, and chestnuts that lay in such     abundance on the earth, and far exceeded the power of the royal     or privileged game to consume.
10136-8{_}10318{_}Indeed, it was the license     granted the nobles of free warren, especially for their swine,     that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date, and     covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts     of wood and brake, to the injury of agriculture and the misery     of the people.
10136-8{_}10319{_}Some idea of the extent to which swine were     grazed in the feudal times, may be formed by observing the     number of pigs still fed in Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean,     and the New Forest, in Hampshire, where, for several months of     the year, the beech-nuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a     diet.
10136-8{_}10320{_}In Germany, where the chestnut is so largely cultivated,     the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous; and     consequently the pig, both wild and domestic, has, for a     considerable portion of the year, an unfailing supply of     admirable nourishment.
10136-8{_}10321{_}Impressed with the value of this fruit     for the food of pigs, the Prince Consort has, with great     judgment, of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in     Windsor Park, and by giving a small reward to old people and     children for every bushel collected, has not only found an     occupation for many of the unemployed poor, but, by providing a     gratuitous food for their pig, encouraged a feeling of     providence and economy.
10136-8{_}10322{_}FOR CURING BACON, AND KEEPING IT FREE FROM RUST (Cobbett's Recipe).
10136-8{_}10323{_}806.
10136-8{_}10324{_}THE TWO SIDES THAT REMAIN, and which are called flitches, are to be cured for bacon.
10136-8{_}10325{_}They are first rubbed with salt on their insides, or flesh sides, then placed one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost, in a salting-trough which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the brine; for, to have sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must not be sopping in brine, which gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and sea pork have.
10136-8{_}10326{_}Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state; therefore change the salt often,--once in 4 or 5 days; let it melt and sink in, but not lie too long; twice change the flitches, put that at bottom which was first on the top: this mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than the sopping mode, but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine, nor keep so well.
10136-8{_}10327{_}As for the time required in making your flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances.
10136-8{_}10328{_}It takes a longer time for a thick than a thin flitch, and longer in dry than in damp weather, or in a dry than in a damp place; but for the flitches of a hog of five score, in weather not very dry or damp, about 6 weeks may do; and as yours is to be fat, which receives little injury from over-salting, give time enough, for you are to have bacon until Christmas comes again.
10136-8{_}10329{_}807.
10136-8{_}10330{_}THE PLACE FOR SALTING SHOULD, like a dairy, always be cool, but well ventilated; confined air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than the midday day sun accompanied by a breeze.
10136-8{_}10331{_}With regard to smoking the bacon, two precautions are necessary: first, to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them; and next, that the smoke must proceed from wood, not peat, turf, or coal.
10136-8{_}10332{_}As to the time required to smoke a flitch, it depends a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath; and whether the fire be large or small: a month will do, if the fire be pretty constant and rich, as a farmhouse fire usually is; but over-smoking, or rather too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rust; great attention should therefore be paid to this matter.
10136-8{_}10333{_}The flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly dry.
10136-8{_}10334{_}Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh side pretty thickly over with bran, or with some fine sawdust, not of deal or fir; rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it: this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a sort of crust to be dried on.
10136-8{_}10335{_}808.
10136-8{_}10336{_}To KEEP THE BACON SWEET AND GOOD, and free from hoppers, sift fine some clean and dry wood ashes.
10136-8{_}10337{_}Put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon; lay in one flitch, and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes.
10136-8{_}10338{_}The place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry, and should the ashes become damp, they should be put in the fireplace to dry, and when cold, put back again.
10136-8{_}10339{_}With these precautions, the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day.

10136-8{_}10342{_}HOG NOT BACON.
10136-8{_}10343{_}ANECDOTE OF LORD BACON.--As Lord Bacon, on one     occasion, was about to pass sentence of death upon a man of the     name of Hogg, who had just been tried for a long career of     crime, the prisoner suddenly claimed to be heard in arrest of     judgment, saying, with an expression of arch confidence as he     addressed the bench, "I claim indulgence, my lord, on the plea     of relationship; for I am convinced your lordship will never be     unnatural enough to hang one of your own family."
10136-8{_}10344{_}"Indeed, replied the judge, with some amazement," I was not     aware that I had the honour of your alliance; perhaps you will     be good enough to name the degree of our mutual affinity."
10136-8{_}10345{_}"I am sorry, my lord," returned the impudent thief, "I cannot     trace the links of consanguinity; but the moral evidence is     sufficiently pertinent.
10136-8{_}10346{_}My name, my lord, is Hogg, your     lordship's is Bacon; and all the world will allow that bacon and     hog are very closely allied."
10136-8{_}10347{_}"I am sorry," replied his lordship, "I cannot admit the truth of     your instance: hog cannot be bacon till it is hanged; and so,     before I can admit your plea, or acknowledge the family compact,     Hogg must be hanged to-morrow morning."
10136-8{_}10348{_}TO BAKE A HAM.
10136-8{_}10349{_}810.
10136-8{_}10350{_}INGREDIENTS.--Ham; a common crust.
10136-8{_}10351{_}Mode.--As a ham for baking should be well soaked, let it remain in water for at least 12 hours.
10136-8{_}10352{_}Wipe it dry, trim away any rusty places underneath, and cover it with a common crust, taking care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in.
10136-8{_}10353{_}Place it in a moderately-heated oven, and bake for nearly 4 hours.
10136-8{_}10354{_}Take off the crust, and skin, and cover with raspings, the same as for boiled ham, and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill.
10136-8{_}10355{_}This method of cooking a ham is, by many persons, considered far superior to boiling it, as it cuts fuller of gravy and has a finer flavour, besides keeping a much longer time good.
10136-8{_}10356{_}_Time_.--A medium-sized ham, 4 hours.
10136-8{_}10357{_}_Average cost_, from 8d.

10136-8{_}10363{_}[Illustration: BOILED HAM.]
10136-8{_}10364{_}811.
10136-8{_}10365{_}INGREDIENTS.--Ham, water, glaze or raspings.
10136-8{_}10366{_}_Mode_.--In choosing a ham, ascertain that it is perfectly sweet, by running a sharp knife into it, close to the bone; and if, when the knife is withdrawn, it has an agreeable smell, the ham is good; if, on the contrary, the blade has a greasy appearance and offensive smell, the ham is bad.
10136-8{_}10367{_}If it has been long hung, and is very dry and salt, let it remain in soak for 24 hours, changing the water frequently.
10136-8{_}10368{_}This length of time is only necessary in the case of its being very hard; from 8 to 12 hours would be sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham.
10136-8{_}10369{_}Wash it thoroughly clean, and trim away from the under-side, all the rusty and smoked parts, which would spoil the appearance.
10136-8{_}10370{_}Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient cold water to cover it; bring it gradually to boil, and as the scum rises, carefully remove it.
10136-8{_}10371{_}Keep it simmering very gently until tender, and be careful that it does not stop boiling, nor boil too quickly.
10136-8{_}10372{_}When done, take it out of the pot, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over it a few fine bread-raspings, put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle, and serve.
10136-8{_}10373{_}If to be eaten cold, let the ham remain in the water until nearly cold: by this method the juices are kept in, and it will be found infinitely superior to one taken out of the water hot; it should, however, be borne in mind that the ham must _not_ remain in the saucepan _all_ night.
10136-8{_}10374{_}When the skin is removed, sprinkle over bread-raspings, or, if wanted particularly nice, glaze it.
10136-8{_}10375{_}Place a paper frill round the knuckle, and garnish with parsley or cut vegetable flowers.
10136-8{_}10376{_}(_See_ Coloured Plate P.)  _Time_.--A ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours to _simmer gently_; 15 lbs., 5 hours; a very large one, about 5 hours.

10136-8{_}10394{_}HOW TO SILENCE A PIG.
10136-8{_}10395{_}ANECDOTE OF CHARLES V.--When the emperor     Charles V. was one day walking in the neighbourhood of Vienna,     full of pious considerations, engendered by the thoughts of the     Dominican cloister he was about to visit, he was much annoyed by     the noise of a pig, which a country youth was carrying a little     way before him.
10136-8{_}10396{_}At length, irritated by the unmitigated noise,     "Have you not learned how to quiet a pig" demanded the imperial     traveller, tartly.
10136-8{_}10397{_}"Noa," replied the ingenuous peasant,     ignorant of the quality of his interrogator;--"noa; and I should     very much like to know how to do it," changing the position of     his burthen, and giving his load a surreptitious pinch of the     ear, which immediately altered the tone and volume of his     complaining.
10136-8{_}10398{_}"Why, take the pig by the tail," said the emperor, "and you will     see how quiet he will become."
10136-8{_}10399{_}Struck by the novelty of the suggestion, the countryman at once     dangled his noisy companion by the tail, and soon discovered     that, under the partial congestion caused by its inverted     position, the pig had indeed become silent; when, looking with     admiration on his august adviser, he exclaimed,--      "Ah, you must have learned the trade much longer than I, for you     understand it a great deal better."
10136-8{_}10400{_}FRIED HAM AND EGGS (a Breakfast Dish).

10136-8{_}10402{_}INGREDIENTS.--Ham; eggs.
10136-8{_}10403{_}_Mode_.--Cut the ham into slices, and take care that they are of the same thickness in every part.
10136-8{_}10404{_}Cut off the rind, and if the ham should be particularly hard and salt, it will be found an improvement to soak it for about 10 minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a cloth.
10136-8{_}10405{_}Put it into a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the slices 3 or 4 times whilst they are cooking.
10136-8{_}10406{_}When done, place them on a dish, which should be kept hot in front of the fire during the time the eggs are being poached.
10136-8{_}10407{_}Poach the eggs, slip them on to the slices of ham, and serve quickly.

10136-8{_}10414{_}_Note_.--Ham may also be toasted or broiled; but, with the latter method, to insure its being well cooked, the fire must be beautifully clear, or it will have a smoky flavour far from agreeable.

10136-8{_}10438{_}IMPORTANCE OF THE BOAR'S HEAD, SCOTTISH FEUDS, &c.--The boar's     head, in ancient times, formed the most important dish on the     table, and was invariably the first placed on the board upon     Christmas-day, being preceded by a body of servitors, a flourish     of trumpets, and other marks of distinction and reverence, and     carried into the hall by the individual of next rank to the lord     of the feast.
10136-8{_}10439{_}At some of our colleges and inns of court, the     serving of the boar's head on a silver platter on Christmas-day     is a custom still followed; and till very lately, a bore's head     was competed for at Christmas time by the young men of a rural     parish in Essex.
10136-8{_}10440{_}Indeed, so highly was the grizzly boar's head     regarded in former times, that it passed into a cognizance of     some of the noblest families in the realm: thus it was not only     the crest of the Nevills and Warwicks, with their collateral     houses, but it was the cognizance of Richard III., that--        "Wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,        That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,        Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough        In your embowell'd bosoms,"--      and whose nature it was supposed to typify; and was universally     used as a _sign_ to taverns.
10136-8{_}10441{_}The Boar's Head in Eastcheap,     which, till within the last twenty-five years still stood in all     its primitive quaintness, though removed to make way for the     London-bridge approaches, will live vividly in the mind of every     reader of Shakspeare, as the resort of the prince of Wales,     Poins, and his companions, and the residence of Falstaff and his     coney-catching knaves, Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym; and whose sign     was a boar's head, carved in stone over the door, and a smaller     one in wood on each side of the doorway.
10136-8{_}10442{_}The traditions and deeds of savage vengeance recorded in     connection with this grim trophy of the chase are numerous in     all parts of Europe.
10136-8{_}10443{_}But the most remarkable connected with the     subject in this country, were two events that occurred in     Scotland, about the 11th and 15th centuries.
10136-8{_}10444{_}A border family having been dispossessed of their castle and     lands by a more powerful chief, were reduced for many years to     great indigence, the expelled owner only living in the hope of     wreaking a terrible vengeance, which, agreeably to the motto of     his house, he was content to "bide his time" for.
10136-8{_}10445{_}The usurper     having invited a large number of his kindred to a grand hunt in     his new domains, and a feast after in the great hall, returned     from the chase, and discovering the feast not spread, vented his     wrath in no measured terms on the heads of the tardy servitors.
10136-8{_}10446{_}At length a menial approached, followed by a line of servants,     and placing the boar's head on the table, the guests rushed     forward to begin the meal; when, to their horror, they     discovered, not a boar's but a bull's head,--a sign of death.
10136-8{_}10447{_}The doors were immediately closed, and the false servants, who     were the adherents of the dispossessed chief, threw off their     disguise, and falling on the usurper and his friends, butchered     them and every soul in the castle belonging to the rival     faction.
10136-8{_}10448{_}A tribe of caterans, or mountain robbers, in the Western     Highlands, having been greatly persecuted by a powerful chief of     the district, waylaid him and his retinue, put them all to the     sword, and cutting off the chief's head, repaired to his castle,     where they ordered the terrified wife to supply them with food     and drink.
10136-8{_}10449{_}To appease their savage humour, the lady gave order     for their entertainment, and on returning to the hall to see her     orders were complied with, discovered, in place of the boar's     head that should have graced the board, her husband's bleeding     head; the savage caterans, in rude derision, as a substitute for     the apple or lemon usually placed between the jaws, having     thrust a slice of bread in the dead man's mouth.

10136-8{_}10468{_}THE PRICE OF A SOW IN AFRICA.--In one of the native states of     Africa, a pig one day stole a piece of food from a child as it     was in the act of conveying the morsel to its mouth; upon which     the robbed child cried so loud that the mother rushed out of her     hovel to ascertain the cause; and seeing the purloining pig make     off munching his booty, the woman in her heat struck the grunter     so smart a blow, that the surly rascal took it into his head to     go home very much indisposed, and after a certain time resolved     to die,--a resolution that he accordingly put into practice;     upon which the owner instituted judicial proceedings before the     Star Chamber court of his tribe, against the husband and family     of the woman whose rash act had led to such results; and as the     pig happened to be a _sow_, in the very flower of her age, the     prospective loss to the owner in unnumbered teems of pigs, with     the expenses attending so high a tribunal, swelled the damages     and costs to such a sum, that it was found impossible to pay     them.
10136-8{_}10469{_}And as, in the barbarous justice existing among these rude     people, every member of a family is equally liable as the     individual who committed the wrong, the father, mother,     children, relatives,--an entire community, to the number of     _thirty-two souls_, were sold as slaves, and a fearful sum of     human misery perpetrated, to pay the value of a thieving old     sow.

10136-8{_}10508{_}NOVEL WAY OF RECOVERING A STOLEN PIG.--It is a well-known fact,     that in Ireland the pig is, in every respect, a domesticated     animal, sharing often both the bed and board of the family, and     making an outer ring to the domestic circle, as, seated round     the pot of potatoes, they partake of the midday meal called     dinner.
10136-8{_}10509{_}An Irishman upon one occasion having lost an interesting     member of his household, in the form of a promising young     porker, consulted his priest on the occasion, and having hinted     at the person he suspected of purloining the "illegant slip of a     pig" he was advised to take no further notice of the matter, but     leave the issue to his spiritual adviser.
10136-8{_}10510{_}Next Sunday his     reverence, after mass, came to the front of the altar-rails, and     looking very hard at the supposed culprit, exclaimed, "Who stole     Pat Doolan's pig?"
10136-8{_}10511{_}To this inquiry there was of course no     answer;--the priest did not expect there would be any.
10136-8{_}10512{_}The     following Sunday the same query was propounded a little     stronger--"Who of you was it, I say, who stole poor Pat Doolan's     pig?"
10136-8{_}10513{_}It now became evident that the culprit was a hardened     sinner; so on the third Sunday, instead of repeating the     unsatisfactory inquiry, the priest, after, as usual, eyeing the     obdurate offender, said, in a tone of pious sorrow, "Mike Regan,     Mike Regan, you treat me with contempt!"
10136-8{_}10514{_}That night, when the     family was all asleep, the latch of the door was noiselessly     lifted, and the "illegant slip of a pig" cautiously slipped into     the cabin.
10136-8{_}10515{_}TO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME.
10136-8{_}10516{_}820.
10136-8{_}10517{_}Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place to put a cross-stick near the bottom, to hang the articles to be smoked on.
10136-8{_}10518{_}Next, in the side, cut a hole near the top, to introduce an iron pan filled with sawdust and small pieces of green wood.
10136-8{_}10519{_}Having turned the tub upside down, hang the articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the opening, and place a piece of red-hot iron in the pan, cover it with sawdust, and all will be complete.
10136-8{_}10520{_}Let a large ham remain 40 hours, and keep up a good smoke.
10136-8{_}10521{_}TO CURE BACON OR HAMS IN THE DEVONSHIRE WAY.
10136-8{_}10522{_}821.
10136-8{_}10523{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 14 lbs.
10136-8{_}10524{_}of meat, allow 2 oz.
10136-8{_}10525{_}of saltpetre, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}10526{_}of salt prunella, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}10527{_}of common salt.
10136-8{_}10528{_}For the pickle, 3 gallons of water, 5 lbs.
10136-8{_}10529{_}of common salt, 7 lbs.
10136-8{_}10530{_}of coarse sugar, 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10531{_}of bay-salt.
10136-8{_}10532{_}_Mode_.--Weigh the sides, hams, and cheeks, and to every 14 lbs.
10136-8{_}10533{_}allow the above proportion of saltpetre, salt prunella, and common salt.
10136-8{_}10534{_}Pound and mix these together, and rub well into the meat; lay it in a stone trough or tub, rubbing it thoroughly, and turning it daily for 2 successive days.
10136-8{_}10535{_}At the end of the second day, pour on it a pickle made as follows:--Put the above ingredients into a saucepan, set it on the fire, and stir frequently; remove all the scum, allow it to boil for 1/4 hour, and pour it hot over the meat.
10136-8{_}10536{_}Let the hams, &c., be well rubbed and turned daily; if the meat is small, a fortnight will be sufficient for the sides and shoulders to remain in the pickle, and the hams 3 weeks; if from 30 lbs.
10136-8{_}10537{_}and upwards, 3 weeks will be required for the sides, &c., and from 4 to 5 weeks for the hams.
10136-8{_}10538{_}On taking the pieces out, let them drain for an hour, cover with dry sawdust, and smoke from a fortnight to 3 weeks.
10136-8{_}10539{_}Boil and carefully skim the pickle after using, and it will keep good, closely corked, for 2 years.
10136-8{_}10540{_}When boiling it for use, add about 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}10541{_}of common salt, and the same of treacle, to allow for waste.
10136-8{_}10542{_}Tongues are excellent put into this pickle cold, having been first rubbed well with saltpetre and salt, and allowed to remain 24 hours, not forgetting to make a deep incision under the thick part of the tongue, so as to allow the pickle to penetrate more readily.
10136-8{_}10543{_}A fortnight or 3 weeks, according to the size of the tongue, will be sufficient.
10136-8{_}10544{_}_Time_--Small meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight, hams 3 weeks; to be smoked from a fortnight to 3 weeks.
10136-8{_}10545{_}The following is from Morton's "Cyclopaedia of Agriculture," and will be found fully worthy of the high character of that publication.
10136-8{_}10546{_}CURING OF HAMS AND BACON.
10136-8{_}10547{_}822.
10136-8{_}10548{_}The carcass of the hog, after hanging over-night to cool, is laid on a strong bench or stool, and the head is separated from the body at the neck, close behind the ears; the feet and also the internal fat are removed.
10136-8{_}10549{_}The carcass is next divided into two sides in the following manner:--The ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side, and the spine, with the ends of the ribs attached, together with the internal flesh between it and the kidneys, and also the flesh above it, throughout the whole length of the sides, are removed.
10136-8{_}10550{_}The portion of the carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedge--the breadth of the interior consisting of the breadth of the spine, and about an inch of the ribs on each side, being diminished to about half an inch at the exterior or skin along the back.
10136-8{_}10551{_}The breast-bone, and also the first anterior rib, are also dissected from the side.
10136-8{_}10552{_}Sometimes the whole of the ribs are removed; but this, for reasons afterwards to be noticed, is a very bad practice.
10136-8{_}10553{_}When the hams are cured separately from the sides, which is generally the case, they are cut out so as to include the hock-bone, in a similar manner to the London mode of cutting a haunch of mutton.
10136-8{_}10554{_}The carcass of the hog thus cut up is ready for being salted, which process, in large caring establishments, is generally as follows.
10136-8{_}10555{_}The skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts by weight of salt, and one part of saltpetre in powder, and the incised parts of the ham or flitch, and the inside of the flitch covered with the same.
10136-8{_}10556{_}The salted bacon, in pairs of flitches with the insides to each other, is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches slightly inclined, and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the brine to receivers in the floor of the salting-house, to be afterwards used for pickling pork for navy purposes.
10136-8{_}10557{_}In this state the bacon remains a fortnight, which is sufficient for flitches cut from nogs of a carcass weight less than 15 stone (14 lbs.
10136-8{_}10558{_}to the stone).
10136-8{_}10559{_}Flitches of a larger size, at the expiration of that time, are wiped dry and reversed in their place in the pile, having, at the same time, about half the first quantity of fresh, dry, common salt sprinkled over the inside and incised parts; after which they remain on the benches for another week.
10136-8{_}10560{_}Hams being thicker than flitches, will require, when less than 20 lbs.
10136-8{_}10561{_}weight, 3 weeks; and when above that weight, 4 weeks to remain under the above-described process.
10136-8{_}10562{_}The next and last process in the preparation of bacon and hams, previous to being sent to market, is drying.
10136-8{_}10563{_}This is effected by hanging the flitches and hams for 2 or 3 weeks in a room heated by stoves, or in a smoke-house, in which they are exposed for the same length of time to the smoke arising from the slow combustion of the sawdust of oak or other hard wood.
10136-8{_}10564{_}The latter mode of completing the curing process has some advantages over the other, as by it the meat is subject to the action of _creosote_, a volatile oil produced by the combustion of the sawdust, which is powerfully antiseptic.
10136-8{_}10565{_}The process also furnishing a thin covering of a resinous varnish, excludes the air not only from the muscle but also from the fat; thus effectually preventing the meat from becoming rusted; and the principal reasons for condemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork are, that by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in the process of salting, and by being more opposed to the action of the air, becomes sooner and more extensively rusted.
10136-8{_}10566{_}Notwithstanding its superior efficacy in completing the process of curing, the flavour which smoke-drying imparts to meat is disliked by many persons, and it is therefore by no means the most general mode of drying adopted by mercantile curers.
10136-8{_}10567{_}A very impure variety of _pyroligneous_ acid, or vinegar made from the destructive distillation of wood, is sometimes used, on account of the highly preservative power of the creosote which it contains, and also to impart the smoke-flavour; in which latter object, however, the coarse flavour of tar is given, rather than that derived from the smoke from combustion of wood.
10136-8{_}10568{_}A considerable portion of the bacon and hams salted in Ireland is exported from that country packed amongst salt, in bales, immediately from the salting process, without having been in any degree dried.
10136-8{_}10569{_}In the process of salting above described, pork loses from eight to ten per cent.
10136-8{_}10570{_}of its weight, according to the size and quality of the meat; and a further diminution of weight, to the extent of five to six per cent., takes place in drying during the first fortnight after being taken out of salt; so that the total loss in weight occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in a proper state for market, is not less on an average than fifteen per cent.
10136-8{_}10571{_}on the weight of the fresh pork.
10136-8{_}10572{_}COLLARED PIG'S FACE (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).
10136-8{_}10573{_}823.
10136-8{_}10574{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pig's face; salt.
10136-8{_}10575{_}For brine, 1 gallon of spring water, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}10576{_}of common salt, 1/2 handful of chopped juniper-berries, 6 bruised cloves, 2 bay-leaves, a few sprigs of thyme, basil, sage, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}10577{_}of saltpetre.
10136-8{_}10578{_}For forcemeat, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10579{_}of ham, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10580{_}bacon, 1 teaspoonful of mixed spices, pepper to taste, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}10581{_}of lard, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 6 young onions.
10136-8{_}10582{_}[Illustration: PIG'S FACE.]
10136-8{_}10583{_}_Mode_.--Singe the head carefully, bone it without breaking the skin, and rub it well with salt.
10136-8{_}10584{_}Make the brine by boiling the above ingredients for 1/4 hour, and letting it stand to cool.
10136-8{_}10585{_}When cold, pour it over the head, and let it steep in this for 10 days, turning and rubbing it often.
10136-8{_}10586{_}Then wipe, drain, and dry it.
10136-8{_}10587{_}For the forcemeat, pound the ham and bacon very finely, and mix with these the remaining ingredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated.
10136-8{_}10588{_}Spread this equally over the head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind it securely with broad tape.
10136-8{_}10589{_}Put it into a saucepan with a few meat trimmings, and cover it with stock; let it simmer gently for 4 hours, and be particular that it does not stop boiling the whole time.
10136-8{_}10590{_}When quite tender, take it up, put it between 2 dishes with a heavy weight on the top, and when cold, remove the cloth and tape.
10136-8{_}10591{_}It should be sent to table on a napkin, or garnished with a piece of deep white paper with a ruche at the top.
10136-8{_}10592{_}_Time_.--4 hours.
10136-8{_}10593{_}_Average cost_, from 2s.
10136-8{_}10594{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}10595{_}6d.
10136-8{_}10596{_}_Seasonable_ from October to March.
10136-8{_}10597{_}THE WILD AND DOMESTIC HOG.--The domestic hog is the descendant     of a race long since banished from this island; and it is     remarkable, that while the tamed animal has been and is kept     under surveillance, the wild type whence this race sprung, has     maintained itself in its ancient freedom, the fierce denizen of     the forest, and one of the renowned beasts of the chase.
10136-8{_}10598{_}Whatever doubt may exist as to the true origin of the dog, the     horse, the ox, and others, or as to whether their original race     is yet extant or not, these doubts do not apply to the domestic     hog.
10136-8{_}10599{_}Its wild source still exists, and is universally     recognized: like the wolf, however, it has been expelled from     our island; but, like that animal, it still roams through the     vast wooded tracts of Europe and Asia.
10136-8{_}10600{_}TO DRESS PIG'S FRY (a Savoury Dish).
10136-8{_}10601{_}824.
10136-8{_}10602{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10603{_}of pig's fry, 2 onions, a few sage-leaves, 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10604{_}of potatoes, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}10605{_}_Mode_.--Put the lean fry at the bottom of a pie-dish, sprinkle over it some minced sage and onion, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; slice the potatoes; put a layer of these on the seasoning, then the fat fry, then more seasoning, and a layer of potatoes at the top.
10136-8{_}10606{_}Fill the dish with boiling water, and bake for 2 hours, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}10607{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.
10136-8{_}10608{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}10609{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10610{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}10611{_}_Seasonable_ from October to March.
10136-8{_}10612{_}TO MELT LARD.
10136-8{_}10613{_}825.
10136-8{_}10614{_}Melt the inner fat of the pig, by putting it in a stone jar, and placing this in a saucepan of boiling water, previously stripping off the skin.
10136-8{_}10615{_}Let it simmer gently over a bright fire, and as it melts, pour it carefully from the sediment.
10136-8{_}10616{_}Put it into small jars or bladders for use, and keep it in a cool place.
10136-8{_}10617{_}The flead or inside fat of the pig, before it is melted, makes exceedingly light crust, and is particularly wholesome.
10136-8{_}10618{_}It may be preserved a length of time by salting it well, and occasionally changing the brine.
10136-8{_}10619{_}When wanted for use, wash and wipe it, and it will answer for making into paste as well as fresh lard.
10136-8{_}10620{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}10621{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10622{_}BOILED LEG OF PORK.
10136-8{_}10623{_}826.
10136-8{_}10624{_}INGREDIENTS.--Leg of pork; salt.
10136-8{_}10625{_}_Mode_.--For boiling, choose a small, compact, well-filled leg, and rub it well with salt; let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days, turning and rubbing it every day.
10136-8{_}10626{_}An hour before dressing it, put it into cold water for an hour, which improves the colour.
10136-8{_}10627{_}If the pork is purchased ready salted, ascertain how long the meat has been in pickle, and soak it accordingly.
10136-8{_}10628{_}Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient cold water to cover it; let it gradually come to a boil, and remove the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}10629{_}Simmer it very gently until tender, and do not allow it to boil fast, or the knuckle will fall to pieces before the middle of the leg is done.
10136-8{_}10630{_}Carrots, turnips, or parsnips may be boiled with the pork, some of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish, and a well-made pease-pudding is an indispensable accompaniment.
10136-8{_}10631{_}_Time_.--A leg of pork weighing 8 lbs., 3 hours after the water boils, and to be simmered very gently.
10136-8{_}10632{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}10633{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10634{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}10635{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10636{_}_Note_.--The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled, makes excellent pea-soup.
10136-8{_}10637{_}ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--The hog has survived changes which have     swept multitudes of pachydermatous animals from the surface of     our earth.
10136-8{_}10638{_}It still presents the same characteristics, both     physical and moral, which the earliest writers, whether sacred     or profane, have faithfully delineated.
10136-8{_}10639{_}Although the domestic     has been more or less modified by long culture, yet the wild     species remains unaltered, insomuch that the fossil relics may     be identified with the bones of their existing descendants.
10136-8{_}10640{_}ROAST GRISKIN OF PORK.
10136-8{_}10641{_}827.
10136-8{_}10642{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little powdered sage.
10136-8{_}10643{_}[Illustration: SPARE-RIB OF PORK.]
10136-8{_}10644{_}[Illustration: GRISKIN OF PORK.]
10136-8{_}10645{_}_Mode_.--As this joint frequently comes to table hard and dry, particular care should be taken that it is well basted.
10136-8{_}10646{_}Put it down to a bright fire, and flour it.
10136-8{_}10647{_}About 10 minutes before taking it up, sprinkle over some powdered sage; make a little gravy in the dripping-pan, strain it over the meat, and serve with a tureen of apple sauce.
10136-8{_}10648{_}This joint will be done in far less time than when the skin is left on, consequently, should have the greatest attention that it be not dried up.
10136-8{_}10649{_}_Time_.--Griskin of pork weighing 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}10650{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}10651{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10652{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}10653{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10654{_}_Note_.--A spare-rib of pork is roasted in the same manner as above, and would take 1-1/2 hour for one weighing about 6 lbs.
10136-8{_}10655{_}[Illustration: BACON FOR LARDING, AND LARDING-NEEDLE.]
10136-8{_}10656{_}LARDING.
10136-8{_}10657{_}828.
10136-8{_}10658{_}INGREDIENTS.--Bacon and larding-needle.
10136-8{_}10659{_}_Mode_.--Bacon for larding should be firm and fat, and ought to be cured without any saltpetre, as this reddens white meats.
10136-8{_}10660{_}Lay it on a table, the rinds downwards; trim off any rusty part, and cut it into slices of an equal thickness.
10136-8{_}10661{_}Place the slices one on the top of another, and cut them evenly into narrow strips, so arranging it that every piece of bacon is of the same size.
10136-8{_}10662{_}Bacon for fricandeau, poultry, and game, should be about 2 inches in length, and rather more than one-eighth of an inch in width.
10136-8{_}10663{_}If for larding fillets of beef or loin of veal, the pieces of bacon must be thicker.
10136-8{_}10664{_}The following recipe of Soyer is, we think, very explicit; and any cook, by following the directions here given, may be able to lard, if not well, sufficiently for general use.
10136-8{_}10665{_}"Have the fricandeau trimmed, lay it, lengthwise, upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at; then with the point of the larding-needle make three distinct lines across, 1/2 inch apart; run the needle into the third line, at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring it out at the first, placing one of the lardoons in it; draw the needle through, leaving out 1/4 inch of the bacon at each line; proceed thus to the end of the row; then make another line, 1/2 inch distant, stick in another row of lardoons, bringing them out at the second line, leaving the ends of the bacon out all the same length; make the next row again at the same distance, bringing the ends out between the lardoons of the first row, proceeding in this manner until the whole surface is larded in chequered rows.
10136-8{_}10666{_}Everything else is larded in a similar way; and, in the case of poultry, hold the breast over a charcoal fire for one minute, or dip it into boiling water, in order to make the flesh firm."
10136-8{_}10667{_}ROAST LOIN OF PORK.
10136-8{_}10668{_}829.
10136-8{_}10669{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little salt.
10136-8{_}10670{_}[Illustration: FORE LOIN OF PORK.]
10136-8{_}10671{_}[Illustration: HIND LOIN OF PORK.]
10136-8{_}10672{_}_Mode_.--Score the skin in strips rather more than 1/4 inch apart, and place the joint at a good distance from the fire, on account of the crackling, which would harden before the meat would be heated through, were it placed too near.
10136-8{_}10673{_}If very lean, it should be rubbed over with a little salad oil, and kept well basted all the time it is at the fire.
10136-8{_}10674{_}Pork should be very thoroughly cooked, but not dry; and be careful never to send it to table the least underdone, as nothing is more unwholesome and disagreeable than underdressed white meats.
10136-8{_}10675{_}Serve with apple sauce, No.
10136-8{_}10676{_}363, and a little gravy made in the dripping-pan.
10136-8{_}10677{_}A stuffing of sage and onion may be made separately, and baked in a flat dish: this method is better than putting it in the meat, as many persons have so great an objection to the flavour.
10136-8{_}10678{_}_Time_.--A loin of pork weighing 5 lbs., about 2 hours: allow more time should it be very fat.
10136-8{_}10679{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}10680{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10681{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}10682{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10683{_}FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HOG.--In British strata, the oldest fossil     remains of the hog which Professor Owen states that he has     examined, were from fissures in the red crag (probably miocene)     of Newbourne, near Woodbridge, Suffolk.
10136-8{_}10684{_}"They were associated     with teeth of an extinct _felis_ about the size of a leopard,     with those of a bear, and with remains of a large cervus.
10136-8{_}10685{_}These     mammalian remains were found with the ordinary fossils of the     red crag: they had undergone the same process of trituration,     and were impregnated with the same colouring matter as the     associated bones and teeth of fishes acknowledged to be derived     from the regular strata of the red crag.
10136-8{_}10686{_}These mammaliferous     beds have been proved by Mr. Lyell to be older than the     fluvio-marine, or Norwich crag, in which remains of the     mastodon, rhinoceros, and horse have been discovered; and still     older than the fresh-water pleistocene deposits, from which the     remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, &c. are obtained in such     abundance.
10136-8{_}10687{_}I have met," says the professor, in addition, "with     some satisfactory instances of the association of fossil remains     of a species of hog with those of the mammoth, in the newer     pliocene freshwater formations of England."

10136-8{_}10697{_}_Seasonable_.--Should be made from September to March.
10136-8{_}10698{_}_Note_.--A pig's check, or Bath chap, will take about 2 hours after the water boils.
10136-8{_}10699{_}PIG'S LIVER (a Savoury and Economical Dish).
10136-8{_}10700{_}831.
10136-8{_}10701{_}INGREDIENTS.--The liver and lights of a pig, 6 or 7 slices of bacon, potatoes, 1 large bunch of parsley, 2 onions, 2 sage-leaves, pepper and salt to taste, a little broth or water.

10136-8{_}10718{_}TO PICKLE PORK.
10136-8{_}10719{_}833.
10136-8{_}10720{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}10721{_}of saltpetre; salt.
10136-8{_}10722{_}_Mode_.--As pork does not keep long without being salted, cut it into pieces of a suitable size as soon as the pig is cold.
10136-8{_}10723{_}Rub the pieces of pork well with salt, and put them into a pan with a sprinkling of it between each piece: as it melts on the top, strew on more.
10136-8{_}10724{_}Lay a coarse cloth over the pan, a board over that, and a weight on the board, to keep the pork down in the brine.
10136-8{_}10725{_}If excluded from the air, it will continue good for nearly 2 years.
10136-8{_}10726{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}10727{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10728{_}for the prime parts.
10136-8{_}10729{_}_Seasonable_.--The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn.
10136-8{_}10730{_}THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE HOG.--A singular circumstance in the     domestic history of the hog, is the extent of its distribution     over the surface of the earth; being found even in insulated     places, where the inhabitants are semi-barbarous, and where the     wild species is entirely unknown.
10136-8{_}10731{_}The South-Sea islands, for     example, were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a     small black hog; and the traditionary belief of the people was     that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves.
10136-8{_}10732{_}Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar, or any other     animal of the hog kind, from which the domestic breed might be     supposed to be derived.
10136-8{_}10733{_}In these islands the hog is the     principal quadruped, and the fruit of the bread-tree is its     principal food, although it is also fed with yams, eddoes, and     other vegetables.
10136-8{_}10734{_}This nutritious diet, which it has in great     abundance, is, according to Foster, the reason of its flesh     being so delicious, so full of juice, and so rich in fat, which     is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter.
10136-8{_}10735{_}TO BOIL PICKLED PORK.
10136-8{_}10736{_}834.
10136-8{_}10737{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pork; water.
10136-8{_}10738{_}_Mode_.--Should the pork be very salt, let it remain in water about 2 hours before it is dressed; put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil, then gently simmer until quite tender.
10136-8{_}10739{_}Allow ample time for it to cook, as nothing is more disagreeable than underdone pork, and when boiled fast, the meat becomes hard.
10136-8{_}10740{_}This is sometimes served with boiled poultry and roast veal, instead of bacon: when tender, and not over salt, it will be found equally good.
10136-8{_}10741{_}_Time_.--A piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs., 1-1/4 hour; 4 lbs., rather more than 2 hours.
10136-8{_}10742{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}10743{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10744{_}for the primest parts.
10136-8{_}10745{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}10746{_}THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--By what nation and in what period the     hog was reclaimed, is involved in the deepest obscurity.
10136-8{_}10747{_}So far     back as we have any records of history, we find notices of this     animal, and of its flesh being used as the food of man.
10136-8{_}10748{_}By some     nations, however, its flesh was denounced as unclean, and     therefore prohibited to be used, whilst by others it was     esteemed as a great delicacy.
10136-8{_}10749{_}By the Mosaic law it was forbidden     to be eaten by the Jews, and the Mahometans hold it in utter     abhorrence.
10136-8{_}10750{_}Dr. Kitto, however, says that there does not appear     to be any reason in the law of Moses why the hog should be held     in such peculiar abomination.
10136-8{_}10751{_}There seems nothing to have     prevented the Jews, if they had been so inclined, to rear pigs     for sale, or for the use of the land.
10136-8{_}10752{_}In the Talmud there are     some indications that this was actually done; and it was,     probably, for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in     the New Testament were kept, although it is usual to consider     that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land.
10136-8{_}10753{_}Indeed,     the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the     Hebrews to the hog, assumes that it did not originate until     about 130 years before Christ, and that, previously, some Jews     were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated.
10136-8{_}10754{_}PORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).
10136-8{_}10755{_}835.
10136-8{_}10756{_}INGREDIENTS.--For the crust, 5 lbs.
10136-8{_}10757{_}of lard to 14 lbs.
10136-8{_}10758{_}of flour, milk, and water.
10136-8{_}10759{_}For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10760{_}of meat allow 1 oz.
10136-8{_}10761{_}of salt, 2-1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}10762{_}of pepper, a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of water.
10136-8{_}10763{_}_Mode_.--Rub into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put with sufficient milk and water to mix the crust, and boil this gently for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}10764{_}Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead and beat it till perfectly smooth.
10136-8{_}10765{_}Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form, cut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut, season it in the above proportion, and press it compactly into the pie, in alternate layers of fat and lean, and pour in a small quantity of water; lay on the lid, cut the edges smoothly round, and pinch them together.
10136-8{_}10766{_}Bake in a brick oven, which should be slow, as the meat is very solid.
10136-8{_}10767{_}Very frequently, the inexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust.
10136-8{_}10768{_}She should bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold, or it will fall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be performed as near the fire as possible.
10136-8{_}10769{_}As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary to raise the crust with the hand only, a glass bottle or small jar may be placed in the middle of the paste, and the crust moulded on this; but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time.
10136-8{_}10770{_}_Sufficient_.--The proportions for 1 pie are 1 lb.
10136-8{_}10771{_}of flour and 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}10772{_}of meat.
10136-8{_}10773{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10774{_}THE FLESH OF SWINE IN HOT CLIMATES.--It is observed by M.     Sonini, that the flesh of swine, in hot climates, is considered     unwholesome, and therefore may account for its proscription by     the legislators and priests of the East.
10136-8{_}10775{_}In Egypt, Syria, and     even the southern parts of Greece, although both white and     delicate, it is so flabby and surcharged with fat, that it     disagrees with the strongest stomachs.
10136-8{_}10776{_}Abstinence from it in     general was, therefore, indispensable to health under the     burning suns of Egypt and Arabia.
10136-8{_}10777{_}The Egyptians were permitted     to eat it only once a year,--on the feast of the moon; and then     they sacrificed a number of these animals to that planet.
10136-8{_}10778{_}At     other seasons, should any one even touch a hog, he was obliged     immediately to plunge into the river Nile, as he stood, with his     clothes on, in order to purify himself from the supposed     contamination he had contracted by the touch.
10136-8{_}10779{_}LITTLE RAISED PORK PIES.
10136-8{_}10780{_}836.
10136-8{_}10781{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}10782{_}of flour, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10783{_}of butter, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10784{_}of mutton suet, salt and white pepper to taste, 4 lbs.
10136-8{_}10785{_}of the neck of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered sage.
10136-8{_}10786{_}_Mode_.--Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the butter into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add a little salt.
10136-8{_}10787{_}When melted, mix it up into a stiff paste, and put it before the fire with a cloth over it until ready to make up; chop the pork into small pieces, season it with white pepper, salt, and powdered sage; divide the paste into rather small pieces, raise it in a round or oval form, fill with the meat, and bake in a brick oven.
10136-8{_}10788{_}These pies will require a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are made so much smaller, and consequently do not require so soaking a heat.
10136-8{_}10789{_}_Time_.--If made small, about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}10790{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10791{_}SWINEHERDS OF ANTIQUITY.--From the prejudice against the hog     among the ancients, those who tended them formed an isolated     class, and were esteemed as the outcasts of society.
10136-8{_}10792{_}However     much the flesh of the animal was esteemed by the Greeks and     Romans, yet the swineherd is not mentioned by either the classic     writers or the poets who, in ancient Greece and Rome, painted     rural life.
10136-8{_}10793{_}We have no descriptions of gods or heroes descending     to the occupation of keeping swine.
10136-8{_}10794{_}The swineherd is never     introduced into the idyls of Theocritus, nor has Virgil admitted     him into his eclogues.
10136-8{_}10795{_}The Eumaeus of Homer is the only     exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the     eyes of a poet of antiquity.
10136-8{_}10796{_}This may be accounted for, on the     supposition that the prejudices of the Egyptians relative to     this class of men, extended to both Greece and Italy, and     imparted a bias to popular opinion.
10136-8{_}10797{_}TO MAKE SAUSAGES.
10136-8{_}10798{_}(_Author's Oxford Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}10799{_}837.
10136-8{_}10800{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}10801{_}of pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle; 1 lb.
10136-8{_}10802{_}of lean veal, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}10803{_}of beef suet, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}10804{_}of bread crumbs, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1 small nutmeg, 6 sage-leaves, 1 teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of savory, 1/2 teaspoonful of marjoram.
10136-8{_}10805{_}_Mode_.--Chop the pork, veal, and suet finely together, add the bread crumbs, lemon-peel (which should be well minced), and a small nutmeg grated.
10136-8{_}10806{_}Wash and chop the sage-leaves very finely; add these with the remaining ingredients to the sausage-meat, and when thoroughly mixed, either put the meat into skins, or, when wanted for table, form it into little cakes, which should be floured and fried.
10136-8{_}10807{_}_Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s.
10136-8{_}10808{_}6d.
10136-8{_}10809{_}_Sufficient_ for about 30 moderate-sized sausages.
10136-8{_}10810{_}_Seasonable_ from October to March.
10136-8{_}10811{_}THE HOG IN ENGLAND.--From time immemorial, in England, this     animal has been esteemed as of the highest importance.
10136-8{_}10812{_}In the     Anglo-Saxon period, vast herds of swine were tended by men, who     watched over their safety, and who collected them under shelter     at night.
10136-8{_}10813{_}At that time, the flesh of the animal was the staple     article of consumption in every family, and a large portion of     the wealth of the rich freemen of the country consisted of these     animals.
10136-8{_}10814{_}Hence it was common to make bequests of swine, with     lands for their support; and to these were attached rights and     privileges in connection with their feeding, and the extent of     woodland to be occupied by a given number was granted in     accordance with established rules.
10136-8{_}10815{_}This is proved by an ancient     Saxon grant, quoted by Sharon Turner, in his "History of the     Anglo-Saxons," where the right of pasturage is conveyed in a     deed by the following words:--"I give food for seventy swine in     that woody allotment which the countrymen call Wolferdinlegh."
10136-8{_}10816{_}FRIED SAUSAGES.
10136-8{_}10817{_}[Illustration: FRIED SAUSAGES.]
10136-8{_}10818{_}838.
10136-8{_}10819{_}INGREDIENTS.--Sausages; a small piece of butter.
10136-8{_}10820{_}_Mode_.--Prick the sausages with a fork (this prevents them from bursting), and put them into a frying-pan with a small piece of butter.
10136-8{_}10821{_}Keep moving the pan about, and turn the sausages 3 or 4 times.
10136-8{_}10822{_}In from 10 to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently cooked, unless they are _very large_, when a little more time should be allowed for them.
10136-8{_}10823{_}Dish them with or without a piece of toast under them, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}10824{_}In some counties, sausages are boiled and served on toast.
10136-8{_}10825{_}They should be plunged into boiling water, and simmered for about 10 or 12 minutes.
10136-8{_}10826{_}_Time_.--10 to 12 minutes.
10136-8{_}10827{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}10828{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}10829{_}_Seasonable_.--Good from September to March.
10136-8{_}10830{_}_Note_.--Sometimes, in close warm weather, sausages very soon turn sour; to prevent this, put them in the oven for a few minutes with a small piece of butter to keep them moist.
10136-8{_}10831{_}When wanted for table, they will not require so long frying as uncooked sausages.
10136-8{_}10832{_}THE SAXON SWINEHERD.--The men employed in herding swine during     the Anglo-Saxon period of our history were, in general, thralls     or born slaves of the soil, who were assisted by powerful dogs,     capable even of singly contending with the wolf until his master     came with his spear to the rescue.
10136-8{_}10833{_}In the "Ivanhoe" of Sir     Walter Scott, we have an admirable picture, in the character of     Gurth, an Anglo-Saxon swineherd, as we also have of his master,     a large landed proprietor, a great portion of whose wealth     consisted of swine, and whose rude but plentiful board was     liberally supplied with the flesh.
10136-8{_}10834{_}SAUSAGE-MEAT CAKES.
10136-8{_}10835{_}839.
10136-8{_}10836{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}10837{_}of lean pork, add 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}10838{_}of fat bacon, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}10839{_}of salt, 1 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.
10136-8{_}10840{_}_Mode_.--Remove from the pork all skin, gristle, and bone, and chop it finely with the bacon; add the remaining ingredients, and carefully mix altogether.
10136-8{_}10841{_}Pound it well in a mortar, make it into convenient-sized cakes, flour these, and fry them a nice brown for about 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}10842{_}This is a very simple method of making sausage-meat, and on trial will prove very good, its great recommendation being, that it is so easily made.
10136-8{_}10843{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}10844{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}10845{_}TO SCALD A SUCKING-PIG.
10136-8{_}10846{_}840.
10136-8{_}10847{_}Put the pig into cold water directly it is killed; let it remain for a few minutes, then immerse it in a large pan of boiling water for 2 minutes.
10136-8{_}10848{_}Take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible.
10136-8{_}10849{_}When the skin looks clean, make a slit down the belly, take out the entrails, well clean the nostrils and ears, wash the pig in cold water, and wipe it thoroughly dry.
10136-8{_}10850{_}Take off the feet at the first joint, and loosen and leave sufficient skin to turn neatly over.
10136-8{_}10851{_}If not to be dressed immediately, fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air.
10136-8{_}10852{_}THE LEARNED PIG.--That the pig is capable of education, is a     fact long known to the world; and though, like the ass,     naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable     with other animals to caresses and kindness, has been shown from     very remote time; the best modern evidence of his docility,     however, is the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited     about a century since, but which has been continued down to our     own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put     together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month,     hour, and date of the exhibition, besides many other     unquestioned evidences of memory.
10136-8{_}10853{_}The instance already given of     breaking a sow into a pointer, till she became more stanch even     than the dog itself, though surprising, is far less wonderful     than that evidence of education where so generally obtuse an     animal may be taught not only to spell, but couple figures and     give dates correctly.
10136-8{_}10854{_}ROAST SUCKING-PIG.
10136-8{_}10855{_}841.
10136-8{_}10856{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pig, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}10857{_}of bread crumbs, 16 sage-leaves, pepper and salt to taste, a piece of butter the size of an egg, salad oil or butter to baste with, about 1/2 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}10858{_}[Illustration: ROAST SUCKING-PIG.]
10136-8{_}10859{_}_Mode_.--A sucking-pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be more than three weeks old, and should be dressed the same day that it is killed.
10136-8{_}10860{_}After preparing the pig for cooking, as in the preceding recipe, stuff it with finely-grated bread crumbs, minced sage, pepper, salt, and a piece of butter the size of an egg, all of which should be well mixed together, and put into the body of the pig.
10136-8{_}10861{_}Sew up the slit neatly, and truss the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, and the under part to be crisp.
10136-8{_}10862{_}Put the pig down to a bright clear fire, not too near, and let it lay till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter tied up in a piece of thin cloth, and rub the pig with this in every part.
10136-8{_}10863{_}Keep it well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting, and do not allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt.
10136-8{_}10864{_}When half-done, hang a pig-iron before the middle part (if this is not obtainable, use a flat iron), to prevent its being scorched and dried up before the ends are done.
10136-8{_}10865{_}Before it is taken from the fire, cut off the head, and part that and the body down the middle.
10136-8{_}10866{_}Chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing; add 1/2 pint of good gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and the gravy that flowed from the pig; put a little of this on the dish with the pig, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}10867{_}Place the pig back to back in the dish, with one half of the head on each side, and one of the ears at each end, and send it to table as hot as possible.
10136-8{_}10868{_}Instead of butter, many cooks take salad oil for basting, which makes the crackling crisp; and as this is one of the principal things to be considered, perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be particular that it is very pure, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat.
10136-8{_}10869{_}The brains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy, when the latter is not liked.
10136-8{_}10870{_}Apple sauce and the old-fashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig.
10136-8{_}10871{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours for a small pig.
10136-8{_}10872{_}_Average cost_, 5s.
10136-8{_}10873{_}to 6s.
10136-8{_}10874{_}_Sufficient_ for 9 or 10 persons.
10136-8{_}10875{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}10876{_}HOW ROAST PIG WAS DISCOVERED.--Charles Lamb, who, in the early     part of this century, delighted the reading public by his quaint     prose sketches, written under the title of "Essays of Elia,"     has, in his own quiet humorous way, devoted one paper to the     subject of _Roast Pig_, and more especially to that luxurious     and toothsome dainty known as "CRACKLING;" and shows, in a     manner peculiarly his own, _how crackling first came into the     world._      According to this erudite authority, man in the golden age, or     at all events the primitive age, eat his pork and bacon raw, as,     indeed, he did his beef and mutton; unless, as Hudibras tells     us, he was an epicure, when he used to make a saddle of his     saddle of mutton, and after spreading it on his horse's back,     and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed, he sat     down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn.
10136-8{_}10877{_}At the epoch of     the story, however, a citizen of some Scythian community had the     misfortune to have his hut, or that portion of it containing his     live stock of pigs, burnt down.
10136-8{_}10878{_}In going over the _débris_ on     the following day, and picking out all the available salvage,     the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot,     which caused him to shake his hand with great energy, and clap     the tips of his suffering fingers to his mouth.
10136-8{_}10879{_}The act was     simple and natural, but the result was wonderful.
10136-8{_}10880{_}He rolled his     eyes in ecstatic pleasure, his frame distended, and, conscious     of a celestial odour, his nostrils widened, and, while drawing     in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume, he sucked his     fingers with a gusto he had never, in his most hungry moments,     conceived.
10136-8{_}10881{_}Clearing away the rubbish from beneath him, he at     last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigs, _roasted to     death_.
10136-8{_}10882{_}Stooping down to examine this curious object, and     touching its body, a fragment of the burnt skin was detached,     which, with a sort of superstitious dread, he at length, and in     a spirit of philosophical inquiry, put into his mouth.
10136-8{_}10883{_}Ye gods!
10136-8{_}10884{_}the felicity he then enjoyed, no pen can chronicle!
10136-8{_}10885{_}Then it was     that he--the world--first tasted _crackling_.
10136-8{_}10886{_}Like a miser with     his gold, the Scythian hid his treasure from the prying eyes of     the world, and feasted, in secret, more sumptuously than the     gods.
10136-8{_}10887{_}When he had eaten up all his pig, the poor man fell into a     melancholy; he refused the most tempting steak, though cooked on     the horse's back, and turned every half-hour after his own     favourite recipe; he fell, in fact, from his appetite, and was     reduced to a shadow, till, unable longer to endure the torments     of memory he hourly suffered, he rose one night and secretly set     fire to his hut, and once more was restored to flesh and     manhood.
10136-8{_}10888{_}Finding it impossible to live in future without     roast-pig, he set fire to his house every time his larder became     empty; till at last his neighbours, scandalized by the frequency     of these incendiary acts, brought his conduct before the supreme     council of the nation.
10136-8{_}10889{_}To avert the penalty that awaited him, he     brought his judges to the smouldering ruins, and discovering the     secret, invited them to eat; which having done, with tears of     gratitude, the august synod embraced him, and, with an     overflowing feeling of ecstasy, dedicated a statue to the memory     of the man who first _instituted roast pork_.
10136-8{_}10890{_}PORK CARVING.
10136-8{_}10891{_}SUCKING-PIG.
10136-8{_}10892{_}[Illustration: SUCKING-PIG.]
10136-8{_}10893{_}842.
10136-8{_}10894{_}A sucking-pig seems, at first sight, rather an elaborate dish, or rather animal, to carve; but by carefully mastering the details of the business, every difficulty will vanish; and if a partial failure be at first made, yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second trial.
10136-8{_}10895{_}A sucking-pig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the engraving (and also in coloured plate S), and the first point to be attended to is to separate the shoulder from the carcase, by carrying the knife quickly and neatly round the circular line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3;--the shoulder will then easily come away.
10136-8{_}10896{_}The next step is to take off the leg; and this is done in the same way, by cutting round this joint in the direction shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, in the same way as the shoulder.
10136-8{_}10897{_}The ribs then stand fairly open to the knife, which should be carried down in the direction of the line 4 to 5; and two or three helpings will dispose of these.
10136-8{_}10898{_}The other half of the pig is served, of course, in the same manner.
10136-8{_}10899{_}Different parts of the pig are variously esteemed; some preferring the flesh of the neck; others, the ribs; and others, again, the shoulders.
10136-8{_}10900{_}The truth is, the whole of a sucking-pig is delicious, delicate eating; but, in carving it, the host should consult the various tastes and fancies of his guests, keeping the larger joints, generally, for the gentlemen of the party.
10136-8{_}10901{_}HAM.
10136-8{_}10902{_}[Illustration: HAM.]
10136-8{_}10903{_}843.
10136-8{_}10904{_}In cutting a ham, the carver must be guided according as he desires to practise economy, or have, at once, fine slices out of the prime part.
10136-8{_}10905{_}Under the first supposition, he will commence at the knuckle end, and cut off thin slices towards the thick part of the ham.
10136-8{_}10906{_}To reach the choicer portion, the knife, which must be very sharp and thin, should be carried quite down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}10907{_}The slices should be thin and even, and always cut down to the bone.
10136-8{_}10908{_}There are some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top, and then slicing pieces off inside the hole, gradually enlarging the circle; but we think this a plan not to be recommended.
10136-8{_}10909{_}A ham, when hot, is usually sent to table with a paper ruffle round the knuckle; when cold, it is served in the manner shown by coloured plate P.   LEG OF PORK.
10136-8{_}10910{_}[Illustration: LEG OF PORK.]
10136-8{_}10911{_}844.
10136-8{_}10912{_}This joint, which is such a favourite one with many people, is easy to carve.
10136-8{_}10913{_}The knife should be carried sharply down to the bone, clean through the crackling, in the direction of the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}10914{_}Sago and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dish,--sometimes the leg of pork is stuffed,--and the guests should be asked if they will have either or both.
10136-8{_}10915{_}A frequent plan, and we think a good one, is now pursued, of sending sage and onion to table separately from the joint, as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this stuffing is agreeable.
10136-8{_}10916{_}_Note_.--The other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their carving or helping.
10136-8{_}10917{_}CHAPTER XVIII.
10136-8{_}10918{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CALF.
10136-8{_}10919{_}845.
10136-8{_}10920{_}ANY REMARKS MADE ON THE CALF OR THE LAMB must naturally be in a measure supplementary to the more copious observations made on the parent stock of either.
10136-8{_}10921{_}As the calf, at least as far as it is identified with veal, is destined to die young,--to be, indeed, cut off in its comparative infancy,--it may, at first sight, appear of little or no consequence to inquire to what particular variety, or breed of the general stock, his sire or dam may belong.
10136-8{_}10922{_}The great art, however, in the modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall not only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable, but, at the same time, a constitution free from all taint, a frame that shall rapidly attain bulk and stature, and a disposition so kindly that every _quantum_ of food it takes shall, without drawback or procrastination, be eliminated into fat and muscle.
10136-8{_}10923{_}The breed, then, is of very considerable consequence in determining, not only the quality of the meat to the consumer, but its commercial value to the breeder and butcher.
10136-8{_}10924{_}846.
10136-8{_}10925{_}UNDER THE ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM adopted in the rearing of domestic cattle, and stock in general, to gratify the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion, we can have veal, like lamb, at all seasons in the market, though the usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its appearance is about the beginning of February.
10136-8{_}10926{_}847.
10136-8{_}10927{_}THE COW GOES WITH YOUNG FOR NINE MONTHS, and the affection and solicitude she evinces for her offspring is more human in its tenderness mid intensity than is displayed by any other animal; and her distress when she hears its bleating, and is not allowed to reach it with her distended udders, is often painful to witness, and when the calf has died, or been accidentally killed, her grief frequently makes her refuse to give down her milk.
10136-8{_}10928{_}At such times, the breeder has adopted the expedient of flaying the dead carcase, and, distending the skin with hay, lays the effigy before her, and then taking advantage of her solicitude, milks her while she is caressing the skin with her tongue.
10136-8{_}10929{_}848.
10136-8{_}10930{_}IN A STATE OF NATURE, the cow, like the deer, hides her young in the tall ferns and brakes, and the most secret places; and only at stated times, twice or thrice a day, quits the herd, and, hastening to the secret cover, gives suck to her calf, and with the same, circumspection returns to the community.
10136-8{_}10931{_}849.
10136-8{_}10932{_}IN SOME COUNTRIES, to please the epicurean taste of vitiated appetites, it is the custom to kill the calf for food almost immediately after birth, and any accident that forestalls that event, is considered to enhance its value.
10136-8{_}10933{_}We are happy to say, however, that in this country, as far as England and Scotland are concerned, the taste for very young veal has entirely gone out, and "Staggering Bob," as the poor little animal was called in the language of the shambles, is no longer to be met with in such a place.
10136-8{_}10934{_}850.
10136-8{_}10935{_}THE WEANING OF CALVES is a process that requires a great amount of care and judgment; for though they are in reality not weaned till between the eighth and the twelfth week, the process of rearing them by hand commences in fact from the birth, the calf never being allowed to suck its dam.
10136-8{_}10936{_}As the rearing of calves for the market is a very important and lucrative business, the breeder generally arranges his stock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall calve about the same time; and then, by setting aside one or two, to find food for the entire family, gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of milk, to carry on the operations of his dairy.
10136-8{_}10937{_}Some people have an idea that skimmed milk, if given in sufficient quantity, is good enough for the weaning period of calf-feeding; but this is a very serious mistake, for the cream, of which it has been deprived, contained nearly all the oleaginous principles, and the azote or nitrogen, on which the vivifying properties of that fluid depends.
10136-8{_}10938{_}Indeed, so remarkably correct has this fact proved to be, that a calf reared on one part of new milk mixed with five of water, will thrive and look well; while another, treated with unlimited skimmed milk, will be poor, thin, and miserable.
10136-8{_}10939{_}851.
10136-8{_}10940{_}IT IS SOMETIMES A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE to induce the blundering calf--whose instinct only teaches him to suck, and that he will do at anything and with anything--acquire the knowledge of imbibition, that for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a bottle with milk, and, opening his mouth, pour the contents down his throat.
10136-8{_}10941{_}The manner, however, by which he is finally educated into the mystery of suction, is by putting his allowance of milk into a large wooden bowl; the nurse then puts her hand into the milk, and, by bending her fingers upwards, makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his lips, when the vacuum caused by his suction of the fingers, causes the milk to rise along them into his mouth.
10136-8{_}10942{_}In this manner one by one the whole family are to be fed three times a day; care being taken, that new-born calves are not, at first, fed on milk from a cow who has some days calved.
10136-8{_}10943{_}852.
10136-8{_}10944{_}AS THE CALF PROGRESSES TOWARDS HIS TENTH WEEK, his diet requires to be increased in quantity and quality; for these objects, his milk can be thickened with flour or meal, and small pieces of softened oil-cake are to be slipped into his mouth after sucking, that they may dissolve there, till he grows familiar with, and to like the taste, when it may be softened and scraped down into his milk-and-water.
10136-8{_}10945{_}After a time, sliced turnips softened by steam are to be given to him in tolerable quantities; then succulent grasses; and finally, hay may be added to the others.
10136-8{_}10946{_}Some farmers, desirous of rendering their calves fat for the butcher in as short a time as possible, forget both the natural weakness of the digestive powers, and the contracted volume of the stomach, and allow the animals either to suck _ad libitum_, or give them, if brought up at the pail or by hand, a larger quantity of milk than they can digest.
10136-8{_}10947{_}The idea of overloading the stomach never suggests itself to their minds.
10136-8{_}10948{_}They suppose that the more food the young creature consumes, the sooner it will be fat, and they allow it no exercise whatever, for fear it should denude its very bones of their flesh.
10136-8{_}10949{_}Under such circumstances, the stomach soon becomes deranged; its functions are no longer capable of acting; the milk, subjected to the acid of the stomach, coagulates, and forms a hardened mass of curd, when the muscles become affected with spasms, and death frequently ensues.
10136-8{_}10950{_}853.
10136-8{_}10951{_}THERE WAS NO SPECIES OF SLAUGHTERING practised in this country so inhuman and disgraceful as that, till very lately, employed in killing this poor animal; when, under the plea of making the flesh _white_, the calf was bled day by day, till, when the final hour came, the animal was unable to stand.
10136-8{_}10952{_}This inhumanity is, we believe, now everywhere abolished, and the calf is at once killed, and with the least amount of pain; a sharp-pointed knife is run through the neck, severing all the large veins and arteries up to the vertebrae.
10136-8{_}10953{_}The skin is then taken off to the knee, which is disjointed, and to the head, which is removed; it is then reflected backwards, and the carcase having been opened and dressed, is kept apart by stretchers, and the thin membrane, the caul, extended over the organs left in the carcase, as the kidneys and sweet-bread; some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole interior, giving that white and frosted appearance to the meat, that is thought to add to its beauty; the whole is then hung up to cool and harden.
10136-8{_}10954{_}854.
10136-8{_}10955{_}THE MANNER OF CUTTING UP VEAL for the English market is to divide the carcase into four quarters, with eleven ribs to each fore quarter; which are again subdivided into joints as exemplified on the cut.
10136-8{_}10956{_}[Illustration: SIDE OF A CALF, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]
10136-8{_}10957{_}_Hind quarter_:--      1.
10136-8{_}10958{_}The loin.
10136-8{_}10959{_}2.
10136-8{_}10960{_}The chump, consisting of the rump         and hock-bone.
10136-8{_}10961{_}3.
10136-8{_}10962{_}The fillet.
10136-8{_}10963{_}4.
10136-8{_}10964{_}The hock, or hind knuckle.
10136-8{_}10965{_}_Fore quarter_:--      5.
10136-8{_}10966{_}The shoulder.
10136-8{_}10967{_}6.

10136-8{_}10969{_}7.

10136-8{_}10971{_}8.
10136-8{_}10972{_}The fore knuckle.
10136-8{_}10973{_}855.
10136-8{_}10974{_}THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A MODERATELY-SIZED WELL-FED CALF, about eight weeks old, are nearly of the following weights:--loin and chump 18 lbs., fillet 12-1/2 lbs., hind knuckle 5-1/2 lbs., shoulder 11 lbs, neck 11 lbs., breast 9 lbs., and fore knuckle 5 lbs.
10136-8{_}10975{_}; making a total of 144 lbs.
10136-8{_}10976{_}weight.
10136-8{_}10977{_}The London mode of cutting the carcase is considered better than that pursued in Edinburgh, as giving three roasting joints, and one boiling, in each quarter; besides the pieces being more equally divided, as regards flesh, and from the handsomer appearance they make on the table.

10136-8{_}10995{_}_Mode_.--Wash the veal, well wipe it, and dredge it with flour; put it down to a bright fire, not too near, as it should not be scorched.
10136-8{_}10996{_}Baste it plentifully until done; dish it, pour over the meat some good melted butter, and send to table with it a piece of boiled bacon and a cut lemon.
10136-8{_}10997{_}_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
10136-8{_}10998{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.

10136-8{_}11002{_}STEWED BREAST OF VEAL AND PEAS.
10136-8{_}11003{_}858.
10136-8{_}11004{_}INGREDIENTS.--Breast of veal, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}11005{_}of butter, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley; 2 blades of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 5 or 6 young onions, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 6 allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful of pepper, 1 teaspoonful of salt, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, green peas.
10136-8{_}11006{_}_Mode_.--Cut the breast in half, after removing the bone underneath, and divide the meat into convenient-sized pieces.
10136-8{_}11007{_}Put the butter into a frying-pan, lay in the pieces of veal, and fry until of a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}11008{_}Now place these in a stewpan with the herbs, mace, cloves, onions, lemon-peel, allspice, and seasoning; pour over them just sufficient boiling water to cover the meat; well close the lid, and let the whole simmer very gently for about 2 hours.
10136-8{_}11009{_}Strain off as much gravy as is required, thicken it with butter and flour, add the remaining ingredients, skim well, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then pour it over the meat.
10136-8{_}11010{_}Have ready some green peas, boiled separately; sprinkle these over the veal, and serve.
10136-8{_}11011{_}It may be garnished with forcemeat balls, or rashers of bacon curled and fried.
10136-8{_}11012{_}Instead of cutting up the meat, many persons prefer it dressed whole;--in that case it should be half-roasted before the water, &c. are put to it.
10136-8{_}11013{_}_Time_.--2-1/4 hours.
10136-8{_}11014{_}_Average cost_, 8-1/2d.
10136-8{_}11015{_}per lb.

10136-8{_}11018{_}BREEDING OF CALVES.--The forwarding of calves to maturity,     whether intended to be reared for stock, or brought to an early     market as veal, is always a subject of great importance, and     requires a considerable amount of intelligence in the selection     of the best course, to adopt for either end.
10136-8{_}11019{_}When meant to be     reared as stock, the breeding should be so arranged that the cow     shall calve about the middle of May.
10136-8{_}11020{_}As our subject, however,     has more immediate reference to the calf as _meat_ than as     _stock_, we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure     adopted in the former case; and here, the first process adopted     is that of weaning; which consists in separating the calf     _entirely_ from the cow, but, at the same time, rearing it on     the mother's milk.
10136-8{_}11021{_}As the business of the dairy would be     suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young, and     butter, cheese, and cream become _desiderata_,--things to be     desired, but not possessed, a system of economical husbandry     becomes necessary, so as to retain our dairy produce, and yet,     for some weeks at least, nourish the calf on its mother's milk,     but without allowing the animal to draw that supply for itself:     this, with the proper substituted food on which to rear the     young animal, is called weaning.

10136-8{_}11026{_}Procure a pretty mould; lay veal, ham, eggs, and parsley in layers, with a little pepper between each, and when the mould is full, get some _strong_ stock, and fill up the shape.
10136-8{_}11027{_}Bake for 1/2 hour, and when cold, turn it out.
10136-8{_}11028{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}11034{_}493.
10136-8{_}11035{_}_Mode_.--Procure 2 white calf's feet; bone them as far as the first joint, and put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours.
10136-8{_}11036{_}Then put the bacon, butter, lemon-juice, onion, herbs, spices, and seasoning into a stewpan; lay in the feet, and pour in just sufficient water to cover the whole.
10136-8{_}11037{_}Stew gently for about 3 hours; take out the feet, dish them, and cover with parsley and butter, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}11038{_}493.
10136-8{_}11039{_}The liquor they were boiled in should be strained and put by in a clean basin for use: it will be found very good as an addition to gravies, &c. &c.

10136-8{_}11044{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11045{_}WHEN A CALF SHOULD BE KILLED.--The age at which a calf ought to     be killed should not be under four weeks: before that time the     flesh is certainly not wholesome, wanting firmness, due     development of muscular fibre, and those animal juices on which     the flavour and nutritive properties of the flesh depend,     whatever the unhealthy palate of epicures may deem to the     contrary.
10136-8{_}11046{_}In France, a law exists to prevent the slaughtering of     calves under _six weeks_ of age.
10136-8{_}11047{_}The calf is considered in prime     condition at ten weeks, when he will weigh from sixteen to     eighteen stone, and sometimes even twenty.
10136-8{_}11048{_}FRICASSEED CALF'S FEET.
10136-8{_}11049{_}861.
10136-8{_}11050{_}INGREDIENTS.--A set of calf's feet; for the batter allow for each egg 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of bread crumbs, hot lard or clarified dripping, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}11051{_}_Mode_.--If the feet are purchased uncleaned, dip them into warm water repeatedly, and scrape off the hair, first one foot and then the other, until the skin looks perfectly clean, a saucepan of water being kept by the fire until they are finished.
10136-8{_}11052{_}After washing and soaking in cold water, boil them in just sufficient water to cover them, until the bones come easily away.
10136-8{_}11053{_}Then pick them out, and after straining the liquor into a clean vessel, put the meat into a pie-dish until the next day.
10136-8{_}11054{_}Now cut it down in slices about 1/2 inch thick, lay on them a stiff batter made of egg, flour, and bread crumbs in the above proportion; season with pepper and salt, and plunge them into a pan of boiling lard.
10136-8{_}11055{_}Fry the slices a nice brown, dry them before the fire for a minute or two, dish them on a napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley.
10136-8{_}11056{_}This should be eaten with melted butter, mustard, and vinegar.
10136-8{_}11057{_}Be careful to have the lard boiling to set the batter, or the pieces of feet will run about the pan.
10136-8{_}11058{_}The liquor they were boiled in should be saved, and will be found useful for enriching gravies, making jellies, &e. &e.
10136-8{_}11059{_}_Time_.--About 3 hours to stew the feet, 10 or 15 minutes to fry them.
10136-8{_}11060{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 9d.
10136-8{_}11061{_}each.
10136-8{_}11062{_}_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.
10136-8{_}11063{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11064{_}_Note_.--This dish can be highly recommended to delicate persons.
10136-8{_}11065{_}COLOUR OF VEAL.--As whiteness of flesh is considered a great     advantage in veal, butchers, in the selection of their calves,     are in the habit of examining the inside of its mouth, and     noting the colour of the calf's eyes; alleging that, from the     signs they there see, they can prognosticate whether the veal     will be white or florid.
10136-8{_}11066{_}COLLARED CALF'S HEAD.
10136-8{_}11067{_}862.

10136-8{_}11070{_}Clean it nicely, divide the head and remove the brains.
10136-8{_}11071{_}Boil it tender enough to take out the bones, which will be in about 2 hours.
10136-8{_}11072{_}When the head is boned, flatten it on the table, sprinkle over it a thick layer of parsley, then a layer of ham, and then the yolks of the eggs cut into thin rings and put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, and white pepper between each layer; roll the head up in a cloth, and tie it up as tightly as possible.
10136-8{_}11073{_}Boil it for 4 hours, and when it is taken out of the pot, place a heavy weight on the top, the same as for other collars.
10136-8{_}11074{_}Let it remain till cold; then remove the cloth and binding, and it will be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}11075{_}_Time_.--Altogether 6 hours.

10136-8{_}11079{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11080{_}FEEDING A CALF.--The amount of milk necessary for a calf for     some time, will be about four quarts a day, though, after the     first fortnight, that quantity should be gradually increased,     according to its development of body, when, if fed exclusively     on milk, as much as three gallons a day will be requisite for     the due health and requirements of the animal.
10136-8{_}11081{_}If the weather     is fine and genial, it should be turned into an orchard or small     paddock for a few hours each day, to give it an opportunity to     acquire a relish for the fresh pasture, which, by the tenth or     twelfth week, it will begin to nibble and enjoy.
10136-8{_}11082{_}After a certain     time, the quantity of milk may be diminished, and its place     supplied by water thickened with meal.
10136-8{_}11083{_}Hay-tea and linseed-jelly     are also highly nutritious substances, and may be used either as     adjuncts or substitutes.

10136-8{_}11087{_}_Mode_.--Remove all the bones from the head, and cut the meat into nice square pieces.
10136-8{_}11088{_}Put 1-1/2 pint of the liquor it was boiled in into a saucepan, with mace, onion, herbs, and seasoning in the above proportion; let this simmer gently for 3/4 hour, then strain it and put in the meat.
10136-8{_}11089{_}When quite hot through, thicken the gravy with a little butter rolled in flour, and, just before dishing the fricassee, put in the beaten yolks of eggs and lemon-juice; but be particular, after these two latter ingredients are added, that the sauce does not boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}11090{_}Garnish with forcemeat balls and curled slices of broiled bacon.
10136-8{_}11091{_}To insure the sauce being smooth, it is a good plan to dish the meat first, and then to add the eggs to the gravy: when these are set, the sauce may be poured over the meat.
10136-8{_}11092{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1-1/4 hour.

10136-8{_}11105{_}THE CALF IN AMERICA.--In America, the calf is left with the     mother for three or four days, when it is removed, and at once     fed on barley and oats ground together and made into a gruel, 1     quart of the meal being boiled for half an hour in 12 quarts of     water.
10136-8{_}11106{_}One quart of this certainly nutritious gruel, is to be     given, lukewarm, morning and evening.
10136-8{_}11107{_}In ten days, a bundle of     soft hay is put beside the calf, which he soon begins to eat,     and, at the same time, some of the dry meal is placed in his     manger for him to lick.
10136-8{_}11108{_}This process, gradually increasing the     quantity of gruel twice a day, is continued for two months, till     the calf is fit to go to grass, and, as it is said, with the     best possible success.
10136-8{_}11109{_}But, in this country, the mode pointed     out in No.
10136-8{_}11110{_}862 has received the sanction of the best experience.

10136-8{_}11150{_}THE CALF'S-HEAD CLUB.--When the restoration of Charles II.
10136-8{_}11151{_}took     the strait waistcoat off the minds and morose religion of the     Commonwealth period, and gave a loose rein to the     long-compressed spirits of the people, there still remained a     large section of society wedded to the former state of things.
10136-8{_}11152{_}The elders of this party retired from public sight, where,     unoffended by the reigning saturnalia, they might dream in     seclusion over their departed Utopia.
10136-8{_}11153{_}The young bloods of this     school, however, who were compelled to mingle in the world, yet     detesting the politics which had become the fashion, adopted a     novel expedient to keep alive their republican sentiments, and     mark their contempt of the reigning family.
10136-8{_}11154{_}They accordingly     met, in considerable numbers, at some convenient inn, on the     30th of January in each year,--the anniversary of Charles's     death, and dined together off a feast prepared from _calves'     heads_, dressed in every possible variety of way, and with an     abundance of wine drank toasts of defiance and hatred to the     house of Stuart, and glory to the memory of old Holl Cromwell;     and having lighted a large bonfire in the yard, the club of fast     young Puritans, with their white handkerchiefs stained _red_ in     wine, and one of the party in a mask, bearing an axe, followed     by the chairman, carrying a _calf's head_ pinned up in a napkin,     marched in mock procession to the bonfire, into which, with     great shouts and uproar, they flung the enveloped head.
10136-8{_}11155{_}This odd     custom was continued for some time, and even down to the early     part of this century it was customary for men of republican     politics always to dine off calf's head on the 30th of January.

10136-8{_}11197{_}COOKING COLLOPS.--Dean Ramsay, who tells us, in his     "Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character," a number of     famous stories of the strong-headed, warm-hearted, and     plain-spoken old dames of the north, gives, amongst them, the     following:--A strong-minded lady of this class was inquiring the     character of a cook she was about to hire.
10136-8{_}11198{_}The lady who was     giving the character entered a little upon the cook's moral     qualifications, and described her as a very decent woman; to     which the astounding reply--this was 60 years ago, and a Dean     tells the story--"Oh, d--n her decency; can she make good     collops?"
10136-8{_}11199{_}ROAST FILLET OF VEAL.
10136-8{_}11200{_}872.
10136-8{_}11201{_}INGREDIENTS.--Veal, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}11202{_}417, melted butter.
10136-8{_}11203{_}_Mode_.--Have the fillet cut according to the size required; take out the bone, and after raising the skin from the meat, put under the flap a nice forcemeat, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}11204{_}417.
10136-8{_}11205{_}Prepare sufficient of this, as there should be some left to eat cold, and to season and flavour a mince if required.
10136-8{_}11206{_}Skewer and bind the veal up in a round form; dredge well with flour, put it down at some distance from the fire at first, and baste continually.
10136-8{_}11207{_}About 1/2 hour before serving, draw it nearer the fire, that it may acquire more colour, as the outside should be of a rich brown, but not burnt.
10136-8{_}11208{_}Dish it, remove the skewers, which replace by a silver one; pour over the joint some good melted butter, and serve with either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork.
10136-8{_}11209{_}Never omit to send a cut lemon to table with roast veal.
10136-8{_}11210{_}[Illustration: FILLET OF VEAL.]

10136-8{_}11217{_}873.
10136-8{_}11218{_}INGREDIENTS.--A small fillet of veal, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}11219{_}417, thickening of butter and flour, a few mushrooms, white pepper to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1/2 glass of sherry.
10136-8{_}11220{_}_Mode_.--If the whole of the leg is purchased, take off the knuckle to stew, and also the square end, which will serve for cutlets or pies.
10136-8{_}11221{_}Remove the bone, and fill the space with a forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}11222{_}417.
10136-8{_}11223{_}Roll and skewer it up firmly; place a few skewers at the bottom of a stewpan to prevent the meat from sticking, and cover the veal with a little weak stock.
10136-8{_}11224{_}Let it simmer very _gently_ until tender, as the more slowly veal is stewed, the better.
10136-8{_}11225{_}Strain and thicken the sauce, flavour it with lemon-juice, mace, sherry, and white pepper; give one boil, and pour it over the meat.
10136-8{_}11226{_}The skewers should be removed, and replaced by a silver one, and the dish garnished with slices of cut lemon.
10136-8{_}11227{_}_Time_.--A.
10136-8{_}11228{_}fillet of veal weighing 6 lbs., 3 hours' very gentle stewing.

10136-8{_}11231{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}11232{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11233{_}THE GOLDEN CALF.--We are told in the book of Genesis, that Aaron, in the lengthened absence of Moses, was constrained by the impatient people to make them an image to worship; and that Aaron, instead of using his delegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes, and appease the discontented Jews, at once complied with their demand, and, telling them to bring to him their rings and trinkets, fashioned out of their willing contributions a calf of gold, before which the multitude fell down and worshipped.
10136-8{_}11234{_}Whether this image was a solid figure of gold, or a wooden effigy merely, coated with metal, is uncertain.
10136-8{_}11235{_}To suppose the former,--knowing the size of the image made from such trifling articles as rings, we must presuppose the Israelites to have spoiled the Egyptians most unmercifully: the figure, however, is of more consequence than the weight or size of the idol.
10136-8{_}11236{_}That the Israelite brought away more from Goshen than the plunder of the Egyptians, and that they were deeply imbued with Egyptian superstition, the golden calf is only one, out of many instances of proof; for a gilded ox, covered with a pall, was in that country an emblem of Osiris, one of the gods of the Egyptian trinity.
10136-8{_}11237{_}Besides having a sacred cow, and many varieties of the holy bull, this priest-ridden people worshipped the ox as a symbol of the sun, and offered to it divine honours, as the emblem of frugality, industry, and husbandry.
10136-8{_}11238{_}It is therefore probable that, in borrowing so familiar a type, the Israelites, in their calf-worship, meant, under a well-understood cherubic symbol, to acknowledge the full force of those virtues, under an emblem of divine power and goodness.
10136-8{_}11239{_}The prophet Hosea is full of denunciations against calf-worship in Israel, and alludes to the custom of kissing these idols, Hosea, viii, 4-6.
10136-8{_}11240{_}FRICANDEAU OF VEAL (an Entree).
10136-8{_}11241{_}874.
10136-8{_}11242{_}INGREDIENTS.--A piece of the fat side of a leg of veal (about 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}11243{_}), lardoons, 2 carrots, 2 large onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay-leaves, pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}11244{_}107.
10136-8{_}11245{_}[Illustration: FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.]
10136-8{_}11246{_}_Mode_.--The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best quality, or it will not be good.
10136-8{_}11247{_}It may be known by the meat being white and not thready.
10136-8{_}11248{_}Take off the skin, flatten the veal on the table, then at one stroke of the knife, cut off as much as is required, for a fricandeau with an uneven surface never looks well.
10136-8{_}11249{_}Trim it, and with a sharp knife make two or three slits in the middle, that it may taste more of the seasoning.
10136-8{_}11250{_}Now lard it thickly with fat bacon, as lean gives a red colour to the fricandeau.
10136-8{_}11251{_}Slice the vegetables, and put these, with the herbs and spices, in the _middle_ of a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon at the top: these should form a sort of mound in the centre for the veal to rest upon.
10136-8{_}11252{_}Lay the fricandeau over the bacon, sprinkle over it a little salt, and pour in just sufficient stock to cover the bacon, &c., without touching the veal.
10136-8{_}11253{_}Let it gradually come to a boil; then put it over a slow and equal fire, and let it _simmer very_ gently for about 2-1/2 hours, or longer should it be very large.
10136-8{_}11254{_}Baste it frequently with the liquor, and a short time before serving, put it into a brisk oven, to make the bacon firm, which otherwise would break when it was glazed.
10136-8{_}11255{_}Dish the fricandeau, keep it hot, skim off the fat from the liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze, with which glaze the fricandeau, and serve with a purée of whatever vegetable happens to be in season--spinach, sorrel, asparagus, cucumbers, peas, &c.
10136-8{_}11256{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}11257{_}If very large, allow more time.
10136-8{_}11258{_}_Average cost_, 3s.
10136-8{_}11259{_}6d.
10136-8{_}11260{_}_Sufficient_ for an entrée.
10136-8{_}11261{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11262{_}FRICANDEAU OF VEAL (_More economical_.)
10136-8{_}11263{_}875.
10136-8{_}11264{_}INGREDIENTS.--The best end of a neck of veal (about 2-1/2 lbs.
10136-8{_}11265{_}), lardoons, 2 carrots, 2 onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little whole white pepper, a few slices of fat bacon.
10136-8{_}11266{_}_Mode_.--Cut away the lean part of the best end of a neck of veal with a sharp knife, scooping it from the bones.
10136-8{_}11267{_}Put the bones in with a little water, which will serve to moisten the fricandeau: they should stew about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}11268{_}Lard the veal, proceed in the same way as in the preceding recipe, and be careful that the gravy does not touch the fricandeau.
10136-8{_}11269{_}Stew very gently for 3 hours; glaze, and serve it on sorrel, spinach, or with a little gravy in the dish.
10136-8{_}11270{_}_Time_.--3 hours.
10136-8{_}11271{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}11272{_}6d.
10136-8{_}11273{_}_Sufficient_ for an entrée.
10136-8{_}11274{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11275{_}_Note_.--When the prime part of the leg is cut off, it spoils the whole; consequently, to use this for a fricandeau is rather extravagant.
10136-8{_}11276{_}The best end of the neck answers the purpose nearly or quite as well.
10136-8{_}11277{_}BOILED CALF'S HEAD (with the Skin on).
10136-8{_}11278{_}876.
10136-8{_}11279{_}INGREDIENTS.--Calf's head, boiling water, bread crumbs, 1 large bunch of parsley, butter, white pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 or 3 grains of cayenne.

10136-8{_}11281{_}When perfectly clean, take the eyes out, cut off the ears, and remove the brain, which soak for an hour in warm water.
10136-8{_}11282{_}Put the head into hot water to soak for a few minutes, to make it look white, and then have ready a stewpan, into which lay the head; cover it with cold water, and bring it gradually to boil.
10136-8{_}11283{_}Remove the scum, and add a little salt, which assists to throw it up.
10136-8{_}11284{_}Simmer it very gently from 2-1/2 to 3 hours, and when nearly done, boil the brains for 1/4 hour; skin and chop them, not too finely, and add a tablespoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded.
10136-8{_}11285{_}Season with pepper and salt, and stir the brains, parsley, &c., into about 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add the lemon-juice and cayenne, and keep these hot by the side of the fire.
10136-8{_}11286{_}Take up the head, cut out the tongue, skin it, put it on a small dish with the brains round it; sprinkle over the head a few bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley; brown these before the fire, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter, and either boiled bacon, ham, or pickled pork as an accompaniment.

10136-8{_}11297{_}[Illustration: HALF A CALF'S HEAD.]
10136-8{_}11298{_}_Mode_.--After the head has been thoroughly cleaned, and the brains removed, soak it in warm water to blanch it.
10136-8{_}11299{_}Lay the brains also into warm water to soak, and let them remain for about an hour.
10136-8{_}11300{_}Put the head into a stewpan, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and when it boils, add a little salt; take off every particle of scum as it rises, and boil the head until perfectly tender.

10136-8{_}11304{_}Bacon, ham, pickled pork, or a pig's cheek, are indispensable with calf's head.
10136-8{_}11305{_}The brains are sometimes chopped with hard-boiled eggs, and mixed with a little Béchamel or white sauce.
10136-8{_}11306{_}_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours.

10136-8{_}11309{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}11310{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11311{_}_Note_.--The liquor in which the head was boiled should be saved: it makes excellent soup, and will be found a nice addition to gravies, &c. Half a calf's head is as frequently served as a whole one, it being a more convenient-sized joint for a small family.
10136-8{_}11312{_}It is cooked in the same manner, and served with the same sauces, as in the preceding recipe.

10136-8{_}11481{_}THE CALF A SYMBOL OF DIVINE POWER.--A singular symbolical     ceremony existed among the Hebrews, in which the calf performed     a most important part.
10136-8{_}11482{_}The calf being a type or symbol of Divine     power, or what was called the _Elohim_,--the Almighty     intelligence that brought them out of Egypt,--was looked upon     much in the same light by the Jews, as the cross subsequently     was by the Christians, a mystical emblem of the Divine passion     and goodness.
10136-8{_}11483{_}Consequently, an oath taken on either the calf or     the cross was considered equally solemn and sacred by Jew or     Nazarene, and the breaking of it a soul-staining perjury on     themselves, and an insult and profanation directly offered to     the Almighty.
10136-8{_}11484{_}To render the oath more impressive and solemn, it     was customary to slaughter a dedicated calf in the temple, when,     the priests having divided the carcase into a certain number of     parts, and with intervening spaces, arranged the severed limbs     on the marble pavement, the one, or all the party, if there were     many individuals, to be bound by the oath, repeating the words     of the compact, threaded their way in and out through the     different spaces, till they had taken the circuit of each     portion of the divided calf, when the ceremony was concluded.
10136-8{_}11485{_}To     avert the anger of the Lord, when Jerusalem was threatened by     Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian host, the Jews had made a     solemn to God, ratified by the ceremony of the calf, if He     released them from their dreaded foe, to cancel the servitude of     their Hebrew brethren.
10136-8{_}11486{_}After investing the city for some time,     and reducing the inhabitants to dreadful suffering and     privation, the Babylonians, hearing that Pharaoh, whom the Jews     had solicited for aid, was rapidly approaching with a powerful     army, hastily raised the siege, and, removing to a distance,     took up a position where they could intercept the Egyptians, and     still cover the city.
10136-8{_}11487{_}No sooner did the Jews behold the retreat     of the enemy, than they believed all danger was past, and, with     their usual turpitude, they repudiated their oath, and refused     to liberate their oppressed countrymen.
10136-8{_}11488{_}For this violation of     their covenant with the Lord, they were given over to all the     horrors of the sword, pestilence, and famine--Jeremiah, xxxiv.

10136-8{_}11578{_}898.
10136-8{_}11579{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}11580{_}of veal cutlets, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}11581{_}of boiled ham, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 2 blades of pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, a strip of lemon-peel finely minced, the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of water, nearly 1/2 pint of good strong gravy, puff-crust.
10136-8{_}11582{_}_Mode_.--Cut the veal into nice square pieces, and put a layer of them at the bottom of a pie-dish; sprinkle over these a portion of the herbs, spices, seasoning, lemon-peel, and the yolks of the eggs cut in slices; cut the ham very thin, and put a layer of this in.
10136-8{_}11583{_}Proceed in this manner until the dish is full, so arranging it that the ham comes at the top.
10136-8{_}11584{_}Lay a puff-paste on the edge of the dish, and pour in about 1/2 pint of water; cover with crust, ornament it with leaves, brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a well-heated oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hour, or longer, should the pie be very large.
10136-8{_}11585{_}When it is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, nearly 1/2 pint of strong gravy: this should be made sufficiently good that, when cold, it may cut in a firm jelly.
10136-8{_}11586{_}This pie may be very much enriched by adding a few mushrooms, oysters, or sweetbreads; but it will be found very good without any of the last-named additions.

10136-8{_}11601{_}NAMES OF CALVES, &c.--During the time the young male calf is     suckled by his mother, he is called a bull-or ox-calf; when     turned a year old, he is called a stirk, stot, or yearling; on     the completion of his second year, he is called a two-year-old     bull or steer (and in some counties a twinter); then, a     three-year-old steer; and at four, an ox or a bullock, which     latter names are retained till death.
10136-8{_}11602{_}It may be here remarked,     that the term ox is used as a general or common appellation for     neat cattle, in a specific sense, and irrespective of sex; as     the British ox, the Indian ox.
10136-8{_}11603{_}The female is termed cow, but     while sucking the mother, a cow-calf; at the age of a year, she     is called a yearling quey; in another year, a heifer, or     twinter; then, a three-year-old quey or twinter; and, at four     years old, a cow.
10136-8{_}11604{_}Other names, to be regarded as provincialisms,     may exist in different districts.

10136-8{_}11647{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11648{_}THE FATTENING OF CALVES.--The fattening of calves for the market     is an important business in Lanarkshire or Clydesdale, and     numbers of newly-dropped calves are regularly carried there from     the farmers of the adjacent districts, in order to be prepared     for the butcher.
10136-8{_}11649{_}The mode of feeding them is very simple; milk     is the chief article of their diet, and of this the calves     require a sufficient supply from first to last.
10136-8{_}11650{_}Added to this,     they must be kept in a well-aired place, neither too hot nor too     cold, and freely supplied with dry litter.
10136-8{_}11651{_}It is usual to     exclude the light,--at all events to a great degree, and to put     within their reach a lump of chalk, which they are very fond of     licking.
10136-8{_}11652{_}Thus fed, calves, at the end of 8 or 9 weeks, often     attain a very large size; viz., 18 to 20 stone, exclusive of the     offal.
10136-8{_}11653{_}Far heavier weights have occurred, and without any     deterioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh.
10136-8{_}11654{_}This     mode of feeding upon milk alone at first appears to be very     expensive, but it is not so, when all things are taken into     consideration; for at the age of 9 or 10 weeks a calf,     originally purchased for 8 shillings, will realize nearly the     same number of pounds.
10136-8{_}11655{_}For 4, or even 6 weeks, the milk of one     cow is sufficient,--indeed half that quantity is enough for the     first fortnight; but after the 5th or 6th week it will consume     the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows; but then     it requires neither oil-cake nor linseed, nor any other food.
10136-8{_}11656{_}Usually, however, the calves are not kept beyond the age of 6     weeks, and will then sell for 5 or 6 pounds each: the milk of     the cow is then ready for a successor.
10136-8{_}11657{_}In this manner a relay of     calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the     end of summer, a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding     one to a useless degree of corpulency.
10136-8{_}11658{_}VEAL SAUSAGES.

10136-8{_}11723{_}It comes principally from     the western counties, and is generally of the Alderney breed.
10136-8{_}11724{_}In     purchasing veal, its whiteness and fineness of grain should be     considered, the colour being especially of the utmost     consequence.
10136-8{_}11725{_}Veal may be bought at all times of the year and of     excellent quality, but is generally very dear, except in the     months of plenty.

10136-8{_}11740{_}COW-POX, OR VARIOLA.--It is to Dr. Jenner, of Berkeley,     Gloucestershire, who died in 1823, that we owe the practice of     vaccination, as a preservative from the attack of that     destructive scourge of the human race, the small-pox.
10136-8{_}11741{_}The     experiments of this philosophic man were begun in 1797, and     published the next year.
10136-8{_}11742{_}He had observed that cows were subject     to a certain infectious eruption of the teats, and that those     persons who became affected by it, while milking the cattle,     escaped the small-pox raging around them.
10136-8{_}11743{_}This fact, known to     farmers from time immemorial, led him to a course of     experiments, the result of which all are acquainted with.

10136-8{_}11762{_}107, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira, cayenne and salt to taste, about 12 mushroom-buttons (when obtainable), 6 hard-boiled eggs, 4 gherkins, 8 quenelles or forcemeat balls, No.
10136-8{_}11763{_}422 or 423, 12 crayfish, 12 croûtons.
10136-8{_}11764{_}_Mode_.--Half a calf's head is sufficient to make a good entrée, and if there are any remains of a cold one left from the preceding day, it will answer very well for this dish.
10136-8{_}11765{_}After boiling the head until tender, remove the bones, and cut the meat into neat pieces; put the stock into a stewpan, add the wine, and a seasoning of salt and cayenne; fry the mushrooms in butter for 2 or 3 minutes, and add these to the gravy.
10136-8{_}11766{_}Boil this quickly until somewhat reduced; then put in the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs _whole_, the whites cut in small pieces, and the gherkins chopped.
10136-8{_}11767{_}Have ready a few veal quenelles, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}11768{_}422 or 423; add these, with the slices of head, to the other ingredients, and let the whole get thoroughly hot, _without boiling_.
10136-8{_}11769{_}Arrange the pieces of head as high in the centre of the dish as possible; pour over them the ragout, and garnish with the crayfish and croûtons placed alternately.
10136-8{_}11770{_}A little of the gravy should also be served in a tureen.
10136-8{_}11771{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to reduce the stock.
10136-8{_}11772{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}11773{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the calf's head, 2s.
10136-8{_}11774{_}9d.
10136-8{_}11775{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}11776{_}A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF VEAL.--A great authority in his native     Paris tells us, that veal, as a meat, is but little nourishing,     is relaxing, and sufficiently difficult of digestion.
10136-8{_}11777{_}Lending     itself, as it does, he says, in all the flowery imagery of the     French tongue and manner, "to so many metamorphoses, it may be     called, without exaggeration, the chameleon of the kitchen.
10136-8{_}11778{_}Who     has not eaten calf's head _au naturel_, simply boiled with the     skin on, its flavour heightened by sauce just a little sharp?
10136-8{_}11779{_}It     is a dish as wholesome as it is agreeable, and one that the most     inexperienced cook may serve with success.
10136-8{_}11780{_}Calf's feet _à la     poulette_, _au gratin_, fried, &c.; _les cervelles_, served in     the same manner, and under the same names; sweetbreads _en     fricandeau_, _piqués en fin_,--all these offer most satisfactory     entrées, which the art of the cook, more or less, varies for the     gratification of his glory and the well-being of our appetites.
10136-8{_}11781{_}We have not spoken, in the above catalogue, either of the liver,     or of the _fraise_, or of the ears, which also share the honour     of appearing at our tables.
10136-8{_}11782{_}Where is the man not acquainted with     calf's liver _à la bourgeoise_, the most frequent and convenient     dish at unpretentious tables?
10136-8{_}11783{_}The _fraise_, cooked in water, and     eaten with vinegar, is a wholesome and agreeable dish, and     contains a mucilage well adapted for delicate persons.
10136-8{_}11784{_}Calf's     ears have, in common with the feet and _cervelles_, the     advantage of being able to be eaten either fried or _à la     poulette_; and besides, can be made into a _farce_, with the     addition of peas, onions, cheese, &c. Neither is it confined to     the calf's tongue, or even the eyes, that these shall dispute     alone the glory of awakening the taste of man; thus, the     _fressure_ (which, as is known, comprises the heart, the _mou_,     and the _rate_), although not a very recherché dish, lends     itself to all the caprices of an expert artist, and may, under     various marvellous disguises, deceive, and please, and even     awaken our appetite."
10136-8{_}11785{_}--Verily, we might say, after this rhapsody     of our neighbour, that his country's weal will not suffer in him     as an able and eloquent exponent and admirer.

10136-8{_}11787{_}BREAST OF VEAL.

10136-8{_}11789{_}912.
10136-8{_}11790{_}The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to that of a fore-quarter of lamb, when the shoulder has been taken off.
10136-8{_}11791{_}The breast of veal consists of two parts,--the rib-bones and the gristly brisket.
10136-8{_}11792{_}These two parts should first be separated by sharply passing the knife in the direction of the lines 1, 2; when they are entirely divided, the rib-bones should be carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6; and the brisket can be helped by cutting pieces in the direction 3 to 4.
10136-8{_}11793{_}The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as it often is with roast breast of veal, each person should receive a piece.
10136-8{_}11794{_}CALF'S HEAD.
10136-8{_}11795{_}[Illustration: CALF'S HEAD.]
10136-8{_}11796{_}913.
10136-8{_}11797{_}This is not altogether the most easy-looking dish to cut when it is put before a carver for the first time; there is not much real difficulty in the operation, however, when the head has been attentively examined, and, after the manner of a phrenologist, you get to know its bumps, good and bad.
10136-8{_}11798{_}In the first place, inserting the knife quite down to the bone, cut slices in the direction of the line 1 to 2; with each of these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat sweetbread, cut in the direction of from 3 to 4.
10136-8{_}11799{_}The eye, and the flesh round, are favourite morsels with many, and should be given to those at the table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs.
10136-8{_}11800{_}The jawbone being removed, there will then be found some nice lean; and the palate, which is reckoned by some a tit-bit, lies under the head.
10136-8{_}11801{_}On a separate dish there is always served the tongue and brains, and each guest should be asked to take some of these.
10136-8{_}11802{_}FILLET OF VEAL.

10136-8{_}11804{_}914.
10136-8{_}11805{_}The carving of this joint is similar to that of a round of beef.
10136-8{_}11806{_}Slices, not too thick, in the direction of the line 1 to 2 are cut; and the only point to be careful about is, that the veal be _evenly_ carved.
10136-8{_}11807{_}Between the flap and the meat the stuffing is inserted, and a small portion of this should be served to every guest.
10136-8{_}11808{_}The persons whom the host wishes most to honour should be asked if they like the delicious brown outside slice, as this, by many, is exceedingly relished.
10136-8{_}11809{_}KNUCKLE OF VEAL.

10136-8{_}11812{_}The engraving, showing the dotted line from 1 to 2, sufficiently indicates the direction which should be given to the knife in carving this dish.
10136-8{_}11813{_}The best slices are those from the thickest part of the knuckle, that is, outside the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}11814{_}LOIN OF VEAL.

10136-8{_}11817{_}As is the case with a loin of mutton, the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it.
10136-8{_}11818{_}If the butcher be negligent in this matter, he should be admonished; for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to be obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place where it should be inserted in order to divide the bones.
10136-8{_}11819{_}When the jointing is properly performed, there is little difficulty in carrying the knife down in the direction of the line 1 to 2.
10136-8{_}11820{_}To each guest should be given a piece of the kidney and kidney fat, which lie underneath, and are considered great delicacies.

10136-8{_}11822{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS.
10136-8{_}11823{_}"Birds, the free tenants of land, air, and ocean,   Their forms all symmetry, their motions grace;   In plumage delicate and beautiful;   Thick without burthen, close as fishes' scales,   Or loose as full-blown poppies to the breeze."
10136-8{_}11824{_}_The Pelican Island_.
10136-8{_}11825{_}917.
10136-8{_}11826{_}THE DIVISIONS OF BIRDS are founded principally on their habits of life, and the natural resemblance which their external parts, especially their bills, bear to each other.
10136-8{_}11827{_}According to Mr. Vigors, there are five orders, each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface of the globe; so that the air, the forest, the land, the marsh, and the water, has each its appropriate kind of inhabitants.
10136-8{_}11828{_}These are respectively designated as BIRDS OF PREY, PERCHERS, WALKERS, WADERS, and SWIMMERS; and, in contemplating their variety, lightness, beauty, and wonderful adaptation to the regions they severally inhabit, and the functions they are destined to perform in the grand scheme of creation, our hearts are lifted with admiration at the exhaustless ingenuity, power, and wisdom of HIM who has, in producing them, so strikingly "manifested His handiwork."
10136-8{_}11829{_}Not only these, however, but all classes of animals, have their peculiar ends to fulfil; and, in order that this may be effectually performed, they are constructed in such a manner as will enable them to carry out their conditions.
10136-8{_}11830{_}Thus the quadrupeds, that are formed to tread the earth in common with man, are muscular and vigorous; and, whether they have passed into the servitude of man, or are permitted to range the forest or the field, they still retain, in a high degree, the energies with which they were originally endowed.
10136-8{_}11831{_}Birds, on the contrary, are generally feeble, and, therefore, timid.
10136-8{_}11832{_}Accordingly, wings have been given them to enable them to fly through the air, and thus elude the force which, by nature, they are unable to resist.
10136-8{_}11833{_}Notwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the earth, birds, when raised in the atmosphere, glide through it with the greatest ease, rapidity, and vigour.
10136-8{_}11834{_}There, they are in their natural element, and can vary their course with the greatest promptitude--can mount or descend with the utmost facility, and can light on any spot with the most perfect exactness, and without the slightest injury to themselves.
10136-8{_}11835{_}918.
10136-8{_}11836{_}THE MECHANISM WHICH ENABLES BIRDS to wing their course through the air, is both singular and instructive.
10136-8{_}11837{_}Their bodies are covered with feathers, which are much lighter than coverings of hair, with which quadrupeds are usually clothed.
10136-8{_}11838{_}The feathers are so placed as to overlap each other, like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house.
10136-8{_}11839{_}They are also arranged from the fore-part backwards; by which the animals are enabled the more conveniently to cut their way through the air.
10136-8{_}11840{_}Their bones are tubular or hollow, and extremely light compared with those of terrestrial animals.
10136-8{_}11841{_}This greatly facilitates their rising from the earth, whilst their heads, being comparatively small, their bills shaped like a wedge, their bodies slender, sharp below, and round above,--all these present a union of conditions, favourable, in the last degree, to cutting their way through the aërial element to which they are considered as more peculiarly to belong.
10136-8{_}11842{_}With all these conditions, however, birds could not fly without wings.
10136-8{_}11843{_}These, therefore, are the instruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion, and are constructed in such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when struck in a downward direction.
10136-8{_}11844{_}If we except, in this action, the slight hollow which takes place on the under-side, they become almost two planes.
10136-8{_}11845{_}In order that the downward action may be accomplished to the necessary extent, the muscles which move the wings have been made exceedingly large; so large, indeed, that, in some instances, they have been estimated at not less than a sixth of the weight of the whole body.
10136-8{_}11846{_}Therefore, when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly, it takes a leap, and immediately stretching its wings, strikes them out with great force.
10136-8{_}11847{_}By this act these are brought into an oblique direction, being turned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards.
10136-8{_}11848{_}That part of the force which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the bird, whilst the horizontal force serves to carry it forward.
10136-8{_}11849{_}The stroke being completed, it moves upon its wings, which, being contracted and having their edges turned upwards, obviate, in a great measure, the resistance of the air.
10136-8{_}11850{_}When it is sufficiently elevated, it makes a second stroke downwards, and the impulse of the air again moves it forward.
10136-8{_}11851{_}These successive strokes may be regarded as so many leaps taken in the air.
10136-8{_}11852{_}When the bird desires to direct its course to the right or the left, it strikes strongly with the opposite wing, which impels it to the proper side.
10136-8{_}11853{_}In the motions of the animal, too, the tail takes a prominent part, and acts like the rudder of a ship, except that, instead of sideways, it moves upwards and downwards.
10136-8{_}11854{_}If the bird wishes to rise, it raises its tail; and if to fall, it depresses it; and, whilst in a horizontal position, it keeps it steady.
10136-8{_}11855{_}There are few who have not observed a pigeon or a crow preserve, for some time, a horizontal flight without any apparent motion of the wings.
10136-8{_}11856{_}This is accomplished by the bird having already acquired sufficient velocity, and its wings being parallel to the horizon, meeting with but small resistance from the atmosphere.
10136-8{_}11857{_}If it begins to fall, it can easily steer itself upward by means of its tail, till the motion it had acquired is nearly spent, when it must be renewed by a few more strokes of the wings.
10136-8{_}11858{_}On alighting, a bird expands its wings and tail fully against the air, as a ship, in tacking round, backs her sails, in order that they may meet with all the resistance possible.
10136-8{_}11859{_}919.
10136-8{_}11860{_}IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EYES of birds, there is a peculiarity necessary to their condition.
10136-8{_}11861{_}As they pass a great portion of their lives among thickets and hedges, they are provided for the defence of their eyes from external injuries, as well as from the effects of the light, when flying in opposition to the rays of the sun, with a nictating or winking membrane, which can, at pleasure, be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain.
10136-8{_}11862{_}This covering is neither opaque nor wholly pellucid, but is somewhat transparent; and it is by its means that the eagle is said to be able to gaze at the sun.
10136-8{_}11863{_}"In birds," says a writer on this subject, "we find that the sight is much more piercing, extensive, and exact, than in the other orders of animals.
10136-8{_}11864{_}The eye is much larger in proportion to the bulk of the head, than in any of these.
10136-8{_}11865{_}This is a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding utility: it seems even indispensable to their safety and subsistence.
10136-8{_}11866{_}Were this organ in birds dull, or in the least degree opaque, they would be in danger, from the rapidity of their motion, of striking against various objects in their flight.
10136-8{_}11867{_}In this case their celerity, instead of being an advantage, would become an evil, and their flight be restrained by the danger resulting from it.
10136-8{_}11868{_}Indeed we may consider the velocity with which an animal moves, as a sure indication of the perfection of its vision.
10136-8{_}11869{_}Among the quadrupeds, the sloth has its sight greatly limited; whilst the hawk, as it hovers in the air, can espy a lark sitting on a clod, perhaps at twenty times the distance at which a man or a dog could perceive it."
10136-8{_}11870{_}920.
10136-8{_}11871{_}AMONGST THE MANY PECULIARITIES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BIRDS, not the least is the mode by which their respiration is accomplished.
10136-8{_}11872{_}This is effected by means of air-vessels, which extend throughout the body, and adhere to the under-surface of the bones.
10136-8{_}11873{_}These, by their motion, force the air through the true lungs, which are very small, and placed in the uppermost part of the chest, and closely braced down to the back and ribs.
10136-8{_}11874{_}The lungs, which are never expanded by air, are destined to the sole purpose of oxidizing the blood.
10136-8{_}11875{_}In the experiments made by Mr. John Hunter, to discover the use of this general diffusion of air through the bodies of birds, he found that it prevents their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium.
10136-8{_}11876{_}It is well known that, in proportion to celerity of motion, the air becomes resistive; and were it possible for a man to move with the swiftness of a swallow, as he is not provided with an internal construction similar to that of birds, the resistance of the air would soon suffocate him.
10136-8{_}11877{_}921.
10136-8{_}11878{_}BIRDS ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE, being found in the coldest as well as the hottest regions, although some species are restricted to particular countries, whilst others are widely dispersed.
10136-8{_}11879{_}At certain seasons of the year, many of them change their abodes, and migrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of life, for a time, than those which they leave.
10136-8{_}11880{_}Many of the birds of Britain, directed by an unerring instinct, take their departure from the island before the commencement of winter, and proceed to the more congenial warmth of Africa, to return with the next spring.
10136-8{_}11881{_}The causes assigned by naturalists for this peculiarity are, either a deficiency of food, or the want of a secure asylum for the incubation and nourishment of their young.
10136-8{_}11882{_}Their migrations are generally performed in large companies, and, in the day, they follow a leader, which is occasionally changed.
10136-8{_}11883{_}During the night, many of the tribes send forth a continual cry, to keep themselves together; although one would think that the noise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that purpose.
10136-8{_}11884{_}The flight of birds across the Mediterranean was noticed three thousand years ago, as we find it said in the book of Numbers, in the Scriptures, that "There went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall upon the camp, and a day's journey round about it, to the height of two cubits above the earth."
10136-8{_}11885{_}922.
10136-8{_}11886{_}IF THE BEAUTY OF BIRDS were not a recommendation to their being universally admired, their general liveliness, gaiety, and song would endear them to mankind.
10136-8{_}11887{_}It appears, however, from accurate observations founded upon experiment, that the notes peculiar to different kinds of birds are altogether acquired, and that they are not innate, any more than language is to man.
10136-8{_}11888{_}The attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been compared to the endeavour of a child to talk.
10136-8{_}11889{_}The first attempts do not seem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song; but, as the bird grows older and becomes stronger, it is easily perceived to be aiming at acquiring the art of giving utterance to song.
10136-8{_}11890{_}Whilst the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes, when he is once sure of a passage, he usually raises his tone, but drops it again when he finds himself unequal to the voluntary task he has undertaken.
10136-8{_}11891{_}"Many well-authenticated facts," says an ingenious writer, "seem decisively to prove that birds have no innate notes, but that, like mankind, the language of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth, will be their language in after-life."
10136-8{_}11892{_}It would appear, however, somewhat unaccountable why, in a wild state, they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only, when the notes of so many others are to be heard around them.
10136-8{_}11893{_}This is said to arise from the attention paid by the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only, generally disregarding the notes of all the rest.
10136-8{_}11894{_}Persons; however, who have an accurate ear, and who have given their attention to the songs of birds, can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed with those of another species; but this is in general so trifling, that it can hardly be considered as more than the mere varieties of provincial dialects.
10136-8{_}11895{_}923.
10136-8{_}11896{_}IN REFERENCE TO THE FOOD OF BIRDS, we find that it varies, as it does in quadrupeds, according to the species.
10136-8{_}11897{_}Some are altogether carnivorous; others, as so many of the web-footed tribes, subsist on fish; others, again, on insects and worms; and others on grain and fruit.
10136-8{_}11898{_}The extraordinary powers of the gizzard of the granivorous tribes, in comminuting their food so as to prepare it for digestion, would, were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on experiment, appear to exceed all credibility.
10136-8{_}11899{_}Tin tubes, full of grain, have been forced into the stomachs of turkeys, and in twenty-four hours have been found broken, compressed, and distorted into every shape.
10136-8{_}11900{_}Twelve small lancets, very sharp both at the point and edges, have been fixed in a ball of lead, covered with a case of paper, and given to a turkey-cock, and left in its stomach for eight hours.
10136-8{_}11901{_}After that time the stomach was opened, when nothing appeared except the naked ball.
10136-8{_}11902{_}The twelve lancets were broken to pieces, whilst the stomach remained perfectly sound and entire.
10136-8{_}11903{_}From these facts, it is concluded that the stones, so frequently found in the stomachs of the feathered tribes, are highly useful in assisting the gastric juices to grind down the grain and other hard substances which constitute their food.
10136-8{_}11904{_}The stones, themselves, being also ground down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard, are mixed with the food, and, no doubt, contribute very greatly to the health, as well as to the nourishment of the animals.
10136-8{_}11905{_}924.
10136-8{_}11906{_}ALL BIRDS BEING OVIPAROUS, the eggs which they produce after the process of incubation, or sitting for a certain length of time, are, in the various species, different both in figure and colour, as well as in point of number.
10136-8{_}11907{_}They contain the elements of the future young, for the perfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed at the large end, between the shell and the inside skin.
10136-8{_}11908{_}It is supposed that from the heat communicated by the sitting bird to this confined air, its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor, and, at the same time, its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction.
10136-8{_}11909{_}By this means, pressure and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg, which, in some inscrutable way, gradually promote the formation and growth of the young, till the time comes for its escaping from the shell.
10136-8{_}11910{_}To preserve an egg perfectly fresh, and even fit for incubation, for 5 or 6 months after it has been laid, Réaumur, the French naturalist, has shown that it is only necessary to stop up its pores with a slight coating of varnish or mutton-suet.
10136-8{_}11911{_}925.
10136-8{_}11912{_}BIRDS HOWEVER, DO NOT LAY EGGS before they have some place to put them; accordingly, they construct nests for themselves with astonishing art.
10136-8{_}11913{_}As builders, they exhibit a degree of architectural skill, niceness, and propriety, that would seem even to mock the imitative talents of man, however greatly these are marked by his own high intelligence and ingenuity.
10136-8{_}11914{_}"Each circumstance   Most artfully contrived to favour warmth.
10136-8{_}11915{_}Here read the reason of the vaulted roof;   How Providence compensates, ever kind,   The enormous disproportion that subsists   Between the mother and the numerous brood   Which her small bulk must quicken into life."
10136-8{_}11916{_}In building their nests, the male and female generally assist each other, and they contrive to make the outside of their tenement bear as great a resemblance as possible to the surrounding foliage or branches; so that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those who are in search of it.
10136-8{_}11917{_}This art of nidification is one of the most wonderful contrivances which the wide field of Nature can show, and which, of itself, ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief, that they and every other part of the creation, are constantly under the protecting power of a superintending Being, whose benign dispensations seem as exhaustless as they are unlimited.

10136-8{_}11920{_}CHICKEN CUTLETS (an Entree).
10136-8{_}11921{_}926.
10136-8{_}11922{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 chickens; seasoning to taste of salt, white pepper, and cayenne; 2 blades of pounded mace, egg and bread crumbs, clarified butter, 1 strip of lemon-rind, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, thickening of butter and flour, 1 egg.
10136-8{_}11923{_}_Mode_.--Remove the breast and leg bones of the chickens; cut the meat into neat pieces after having skinned it, and season the cutlets with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and cayenne.
10136-8{_}11924{_}Put the bones, trimmings, &c., into a stewpan with 1 pint of water, adding carrots, onions, and lemon-peel in the above proportion; stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, and strain the gravy.
10136-8{_}11925{_}Thicken it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and 1 egg well beaten; stir it over the fire, and bring it to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil.
10136-8{_}11926{_}In the mean time, egg and bread-crumb the cutlets, and give them a few drops of clarified butter; fry them a delicate brown, occasionally turning them; arrange them pyramidically on the dish, and pour over them the sauce.
10136-8{_}11927{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the cutlets.
10136-8{_}11928{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}11929{_}each.
10136-8{_}11930{_}_Sufficient_ for an entrée.
10136-8{_}11931{_}_Seasonable_ from April to July.
10136-8{_}11932{_}FOWLS AS FOOD.--Brillat Savarin, pre-eminent in gastronomic     taste, says that he believes the whole gallinaceous family was     made to enrich our larders and furnish our tables; for, from the     quail to the turkey, he avers their flesh is a light aliment,     full of flavour, and fitted equally well for the invalid as for     the man of robust health.
10136-8{_}11933{_}The fine flavour, however, which     Nature has given to all birds coming under the definition of     poultry, man has not been satisfied with, and has used many     means--such as keeping them in solitude and darkness, and     forcing them to eat--to give them an unnatural state of fatness     or fat.
10136-8{_}11934{_}This fat, thus artificially produced, is doubtless     delicious, and the taste and succulence of the boiled and     roasted bird draw forth the praise of the guests around the     table.
10136-8{_}11935{_}Well-fattened and tender, a fowl is to the cook what the     canvas is to the painter; for do we not see it served boiled,     roasted, fried, fricasseed, hashed, hot, cold, whole,     dismembered, boned, broiled, stuffed, on dishes, and in     pies,--always handy and ever acceptable?
10136-8{_}11936{_}THE COMMON OR DOMESTIC FOWL.--From time immemorial, the common     or domestic fowl has been domesticated in England, and is     supposed to be originally the offspring of some wild species     which abound in the forests of India.
10136-8{_}11937{_}It is divided into a     variety of breeds, but the most esteemed are, the Poland or     Black, the Dorking, the Bantam, the Game Fowl, and the Malay or     Chittagong.
10136-8{_}11938{_}The common, or barn-door fowl, is one of the most     delicate of the varieties; and at Dorking, in Surrey, the breed     is brought to great perfection.
10136-8{_}11939{_}Till they are four months old,     the term chicken is applied to the young female; after that age     they are called pullets, till they begin to lay, when they are     called hens.
10136-8{_}11940{_}The English counties most productive in poultry are     Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Herts, Devon, and Somerset.
10136-8{_}11941{_}FRENCH CHICKEN CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}11942{_}927.
10136-8{_}11943{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, fried bread, clarified butter, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste.
10136-8{_}11944{_}For sauce,--1 oz.
10136-8{_}11945{_}of butter, 2 minced shalots, a few slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 blade of pounded mace, 6 peppercorns, 1/4 pint of gravy.
10136-8{_}11946{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowls into as many nice cutlets as possible; take a corresponding number of sippets about the same size, all cut one shape; fry them a pale brown, put them before the fire, then dip the cutlets into clarified butter mixed with the yolk of an egg, cover with bread crumbs seasoned in the above proportion, with lemon-peel, mace, salt, and cayenne; fry them for about 5 minutes, put each piece on one of the sippets, pile them high in the dish, and serve with the following sauce, which should be made ready for the cutlets.
10136-8{_}11947{_}Put the butter into a stewpan, add the shalots, carrot, herbs, mace, and peppercorns; fry for 10 minutes or rather longer; pour in 1/2 pint of good gravy, made of the chicken bones, stew gently for 20 minutes, strain it, and serve.
10136-8{_}11948{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to fry the cutlets; 35 minutes to make the gravy.
10136-8{_}11949{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the chicken, 9d.
10136-8{_}11950{_}_Seasonable_ from April to July.
10136-8{_}11951{_}EGGS FOR HATCHING.--Eggs intended for hatching should be removed     as soon as laid, and placed in bran in a dry, cool place.
10136-8{_}11952{_}Choose     those that are near of a size; and, as a rule, avoid those that     are equally thick at both ends,--such, probably, contain a     double yolk, and will come to no good.
10136-8{_}11953{_}Eggs intended for     hatching should never be stored longer than a month, as much     less the better.
10136-8{_}11954{_}Nine eggs may be placed under a Bantam hen, and     as many as fifteen under a Dorking.
10136-8{_}11955{_}The odd number is considered     preferable, as more easily packed.
10136-8{_}11956{_}It will be as well to mark     the eggs you give the hen to sit on, so that you may know if she     lays any more: if she does, you must remove them; for, if     hatched at all, they would be too late for the brood.
10136-8{_}11957{_}If during     incubation an egg should be broken, remove it, and take out the     remainder, and cleanse them in luke-warm water, or it is     probable the sticky nature of the contents of the broken egg     will make the others cling to the hen's feathers; and they, too,     may be fractured.
10136-8{_}11958{_}HENS SITTING.--Some hens are very capricious as regards sitting;     they will make a great fuss, and keep pining for the nest, and,     when they are permitted to take to it, they will sit just long     enough to addle the eggs, and then they're off again.
10136-8{_}11959{_}The safest     way to guard against such annoyance, is to supply the hen with     some hard-boiled eggs; if she sits on them a reasonable time,     and seems steadily inclined, like a good matron, you may then     give her proper eggs, and let her set about the business in     earnest.
10136-8{_}11960{_}CHICKEN OR FOWL PATTIES.
10136-8{_}11961{_}928.
10136-8{_}11962{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast chicken or fowl; to every 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}11963{_}of meat allow 2 oz.
10136-8{_}11964{_}of ham, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of veal gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel; cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}11965{_}of butter rolled in flour; puff paste.
10136-8{_}11966{_}_Mode_.--Mince very small the white meat from a cold roast fowl, after removing all the skin; weigh it, and to every 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}11967{_}of meat allow the above proportion of minced ham.
10136-8{_}11968{_}Put these into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients, stir over the fire for 10 minutes or 1/4 hour, taking care that the mixture does not burn.
10136-8{_}11969{_}Roll out some puff paste about 1/4 inch in thickness; line the patty-pans with this, put upon each a small piece of bread, and cover with another layer of paste; brush over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for about 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}11970{_}When done, cut a round piece out of the top, and, with a small spoon, take out the bread (be particular in not breaking the outside border of the crust), and fill the patties with the mixture.
10136-8{_}11971{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to prepare the meat; not quite 1/4 hour to bake the crust.
10136-8{_}11972{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}11973{_}HATCHING.--Sometimes the chick within the shell is unable to     break away from its prison; for the white of the egg will     occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners'     clue, when the poor chick is in a terrible fix.
10136-8{_}11974{_}An able writer     says, "Assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely,     and thence unnecessarily, but only in the case of the chick     being plainly unable to release itself; then, indeed, an     addition may probably be made to the brood, as great numbers are     always lost in this way.
10136-8{_}11975{_}The chick makes a circular fracture at     the big end of the egg, and a section of about one-third of the     length of the shell being separated, delivers the prisoner,     provided there is no obstruction from adhesion of the body to     the membrane which lines the shell.
10136-8{_}11976{_}Between the body of the     chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous     fluid, the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of     incubation, until it becomes a positive glue.
10136-8{_}11977{_}When this happens,     the feathers stick fast to the shell, and the chicks remain     confined, and must perish, if not released."
10136-8{_}11978{_}The method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a     difficulty in releasing themselves from the shell, is to take     the egg in the hand, and dipping the finger or a piece of linen     rag in warm water, to apply it to the fastened parts until they     are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and     separated from the feathers.
10136-8{_}11979{_}The chick, then, being returned to     the nest, will extricate itself,--a mode generally to be     observed, since, if violence were used, it would prove fatal.
10136-8{_}11980{_}Nevertheless, breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary; and     separating with the fingers, as gently as may be, the membrane     from the feathers, which are still to be moistened as mentioned     above, to facilitate the operation.
10136-8{_}11981{_}The points of small scissors     may be useful, and when there is much resistance, as also     apparent pain to the bird, the process must be conducted in the     gentlest manner, and the shell separated into a number of small     pieces.
10136-8{_}11982{_}The signs of a need of assistance are the egg being     partly pecked and chipped, and the cluck discontinuing its     efforts for five of six hours.
10136-8{_}11983{_}Weakness from cold may disable     the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell,     which must then be artificially performed with a circular     fracture, such as is made by the bird itself.
10136-8{_}11984{_}CHICKEN OR FOWL PIE.
10136-8{_}11985{_}929.
10136-8{_}11986{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 small fowls or 1 large one, white pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded mace, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}11987{_}417, a few slices of ham, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of water, puff crust.
10136-8{_}11988{_}_Mode_.--Skin and cut up the fowls into joints, and put the neck, leg, and backbones in a stewpan, with a little water, an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a blade of mace; let these stew for about an hour, and, when done, strain off the liquor: this is for gravy.
10136-8{_}11989{_}Put a layer of fowl at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of ham, then one of forcemeat and hard-boiled eggs cut in rings; between the layers put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt.
10136-8{_}11990{_}Proceed in this manner until the dish is full, and pour in about 1/2 pint of water; border the edge of the dish with puff crust, put on the cover, ornament the top, and glaze it by brushing over it the yolk of an egg.
10136-8{_}11991{_}Bake from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour, should the pie be very large, and, when done, pour in, at the top, the gravy made from the bones.
10136-8{_}11992{_}If to be eaten cold, and wished particularly nice, the joints of the fowls should be boned, and placed in the dish with alternate layers of forcemeat; sausage-meat may also be substituted for the forcemeat, and is now very much used.
10136-8{_}11993{_}When the chickens are boned, and mixed with sausage-meat, the pie will take about 2 hours to bake.
10136-8{_}11994{_}It should be covered with a piece of paper when about half-done, to prevent the paste from being dried up or scorched.
10136-8{_}11995{_}_Time_.--For a pie with unboned meat, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; with boned meat and sausage or forcemeat, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
10136-8{_}11996{_}_Average cost_, with 2 fowls, 6s.
10136-8{_}11997{_}6d.
10136-8{_}11998{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}11999{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12000{_}THE YOUNG CHICKS.--The chicks that are hatched first should be     taken from underneath the hen, lest she might think her task at     an end, and leave the remaining eggs to spoil.
10136-8{_}12001{_}As soon as the     young birds are taken from the mother, they must be placed in a     basket lined with soft wool, flannel, or hay, and stood in the     sunlight if it be summer time, or by the fire if the weather be     cold.
10136-8{_}12002{_}It is a common practice to cram young chicks with food as     soon as they are born.
10136-8{_}12003{_}This is quite unnecessary.
10136-8{_}12004{_}They will, so     long as they are kept warm, come to no harm if they take no food     for twenty-four hours following their birth.
10136-8{_}12005{_}Should the whole of     the brood not be hatched by that time, those that are born may     be fed with bread soaked in milk, and the yolk of a hard-boiled     egg.
10136-8{_}12006{_}POTTED CHICKEN OR FOWL (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).
10136-8{_}12007{_}930.
10136-8{_}12008{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast chicken; to every lb.
10136-8{_}12009{_}of meat allow 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}12010{_}of fresh butter, salt and cayenne to taste, 1 teaspoonful of pounded mace, 1/4 small nutmeg.
10136-8{_}12011{_}_Mode_.--Strip the meat from the bones of cold roast fowl; when it is freed from gristle and skin, weigh it, and, to every lb.
10136-8{_}12012{_}of meat, allow the above proportion of butter, seasoning, and spices.
10136-8{_}12013{_}Cut the meat into small pieces, pound it well with the fresh butter, sprinkle in the spices gradually, and keep pounding until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste.
10136-8{_}12014{_}Put it into potting-pots for use, and cover it with clarified butter, about 1/4 inch in thickness, and, if to be kept for some time, tie over a bladder: 2 or 3 slices of ham, minced and pounded with the above ingredients, will be found an improvement.
10136-8{_}12015{_}It should be kept in a dry place.
10136-8{_}12016{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12017{_}FEEDING AND COOPING THE CHICKS.--When all the chicks are     hatched, they should be placed along with the mother under a     coop in a warm dry spot.
10136-8{_}12018{_}If two hens happen to have their broods     at the same time, their respective chicks should be carefully     kept separate; as, if they get mixed, and so go under the wrong     coop, the hens will probably maim and destroy those who have     mistaken their dwelling.
10136-8{_}12019{_}After being kept snug beneath the coop     for a week (the coop should be placed under cover at nightfall),     the chicks may be turned loose for an hour or so in the warmest     part of the day.
10136-8{_}12020{_}They should be gradually weaned from the soaked     bread and chopped egg, instead of which grits or boiled barley     should be given; in 8 or 10 days their stomachs will be strong     enough to receive bruised barley, and at the end of 3 weeks, if     your chicks be healthy, they will be able to take care of     themselves.
10136-8{_}12021{_}It will be well, however, to keep your eye on them a     week or so longer, as the elder chickens may drive them from     their food.
10136-8{_}12022{_}Great care should be taken that the very young     chicks do not run about the wet ground or on damp grass, as this     is the most prominent and fatal cause of disease.
10136-8{_}12023{_}While under     the coop with their mother, a shallow pan or plate of water     should be supplied to the chicks, as in a deeper vessel they are     liable to drench themselves and take cold, or possibly to get     drowned.
10136-8{_}12024{_}CHICKEN OR FOWL SALAD.
10136-8{_}12025{_}931.
10136-8{_}12026{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled chicken, 2 lettuces, a little endive, 1 cucumber, a few slices of boiled beetroot, salad-dressing No.
10136-8{_}12027{_}506.
10136-8{_}12028{_}_Mode_.--Trim neatly the remains of the chicken; wash, dry, and slice the lettuces, and place in the middle of a dish; put the pieces of fowl on the top, and pour the salad-dressing over them.
10136-8{_}12029{_}Garnish the edge of the salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings, sliced cucumber, and boiled beetroot cut in slices.
10136-8{_}12030{_}Instead of cutting the eggs in rings, the yolks may be rubbed through a hair sieve, and the whites chopped very finely, and arranged on the salad in small bunches, yellow and white alternately.
10136-8{_}12031{_}This should not be made long before it is wanted for table.
10136-8{_}12032{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.
10136-8{_}12033{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}12034{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12035{_}AGE AND FLAVOUR OF CHICKENS.--It has been the opinion of the     medical faculty of all ages and all countries, that the flesh of     the young chicken is the must delicate and easy to digest of all     animal food.
10136-8{_}12036{_}It is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other     animal, and its entire freedom from any irritating quality     renders it a fit dish for the ailing, or those whose stomachs     are naturally weak.
10136-8{_}12037{_}In no animal, however, does age work such a     change, in regard to the quality of its flesh, as it does in     domestic fowls.
10136-8{_}12038{_}In their infancy, cocks and hens are equally     tender and toothsome; but as time overtakes them it is the cock     whose flesh toughens first.
10136-8{_}12039{_}A year-old cock, indeed, is fit for     little else than to be converted into soup, while a hen at the     same age, although sufficiently substantial, is not callous to     the insinuations of a carving-knife.
10136-8{_}12040{_}As regards capons, however,     the rule respecting age does not hold good.
10136-8{_}12041{_}There is scarcely to     be found a more delicious animal than a well-fed, well-dressed     capon.
10136-8{_}12042{_}Age does not dry up his juices; indeed, like wine, he     seems but to mellow.
10136-8{_}12043{_}At three years old, even, he is as tender     as a chick, with the additional advantage of his proper chicken     flavour being fully developed.
10136-8{_}12044{_}The above remarks, however,     concerning the capon, only apply to such as are _naturally_ fed,     and not crammed.
10136-8{_}12045{_}The latter process may produce a     handsome-looking bird, and it may weigh enough to satisfy the     whim or avarice of its stuffer; but, when before the fire, it     will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected,     and will weep a drippingpan-ful of fat tears.
10136-8{_}12046{_}You will never     find heart enough to place such a grief-worn guest at the head     of your table.
10136-8{_}12047{_}It should be borne in mind as a rule, that     small-boned and short-legged poultry are likely to excel the     contrary sort in delicacy of colour, flavour, and fineness of     flesh.
10136-8{_}12048{_}HASHED DUCK (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12049{_}932.
10136-8{_}12050{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock or water, 1 onion, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}12051{_}of butter, thickening of butter and flour, salt and cayenne to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 glass of port wine.
10136-8{_}12052{_}_Mode_.--Cut the duck into nice joints, and put the trimmings into a stewpan; slice and fry the onion in a little butter; add these to the trimmings, pour in the above proportion of weak stock or water, and stew gently for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12053{_}Strain the liquor, thicken it with butter and flour, season with salt and cayenne, and add the remaining ingredients; boil it up and skim well; lay in the pieces of duck, and let them get thoroughly hot through by the side of the fire, but do not allow them to boil: they should soak in the gravy for about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12054{_}Garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}12055{_}The hash may be made richer by using a stronger and more highly-flavoured gravy; a little spice or pounded mace may also be added, when their flavour is liked.
10136-8{_}12056{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12057{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 4d.
10136-8{_}12058{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February; ducklings from May to August.
10136-8{_}12059{_}THE DUCK.--This bird belongs to the order of _Natatores_, or     Swimmers; the most familiar tribes of which are ducks, swans,     geese, auks, penguins, petrels, pelicans, guillemots, gulls, and     terns.
10136-8{_}12060{_}They mostly live in the water, feeding on fish, worms,     and aquatic plants.
10136-8{_}12061{_}They are generally polygamous, and make     their nests among reeds, or in moist places.
10136-8{_}12062{_}The flesh of many     of the species is eatable, but that of some is extremely rank     and oily.
10136-8{_}12063{_}The duck is a native of Britain, but is found on the     margins of most of the European lakes.
10136-8{_}12064{_}It is excessively greedy,     and by no means a nice feeder.
10136-8{_}12065{_}It requires a mixture of     vegetable and animal food; but aquatic insects, corn, and     vegetables, are its proper food.
10136-8{_}12066{_}Its flesh, however, is savoury,     being not so gross as that of the goose, and of easier     digestion.
10136-8{_}12067{_}In the green-pea season it is usually found on an     English table; but, according to Ude, "November is its proper     season, when it is plump and fat."
10136-8{_}12068{_}TO RAGOUT A DUCK WHOLE.
10136-8{_}12069{_}933.
10136-8{_}12070{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 large duck, pepper and salt to taste, good beef gravy, 2 onions sliced, 4 sage-leaves, a few leaves of lemon thyme, thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}12071{_}_Mode_.--After having emptied and singed the duck, season it inside with pepper and salt, and truss it.
10136-8{_}12072{_}Roast it before a clear fire for about 20 minutes, and let it acquire a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}12073{_}Put it into a stewpan with sufficient well-seasoned beef gravy to cover it; slice and fry the onions, and add these, with the sage-leaves and lemon thyme, both of which should be finely minced, to the stock.
10136-8{_}12074{_}Simmer gently until the duck is tender; strain, skim, and thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour; boil it up, pour over the duck, and serve.
10136-8{_}12075{_}When in season, about, 1-1/2 pint of young green peas, boiled separately, and put in the ragoût, very much improve this dish.
10136-8{_}12076{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to roast the duck; 20 minutes to stew it.

10136-8{_}12083{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February; ducklings from April to August.
10136-8{_}12084{_}[Illustration: BUENOS AYRES DUCKS.]
10136-8{_}12085{_}THE BUENOS AYRES DUCK.--The Buenos Ayres duck is of East-Indian     birth, and is chiefly valuable as an ornament; for we suppose     one would as soon think of picking a Chinese teal for luncheon,     or a gold fish for breakfast, as to consign the handsome Buenos     Ayres to the spit.
10136-8{_}12086{_}The prevailing colour of this bird is black,     with a metallic lustre, and a gleaming of blue steel about its     breast and wings.
10136-8{_}12087{_}VARIETIES OF DUCKS.--Naturalists count nearly a hundred     different species of ducks; and there is no doubt that the     intending keeper of these harmless and profitable birds may     easily take his choice from amongst twenty different sorts.
10136-8{_}12088{_}There is, however, so little difference in the various members     of the family, either as regards hardiness, laying, or hatching,     that the most incompetent fancier or breeder may indulge his     taste without danger of making a bad bargain.
10136-8{_}12089{_}In connection with     their value for table, light-coloured ducks are always of milder     flavour than those that are dark-coloured, the white Aylesbury's     being general favourites.
10136-8{_}12090{_}Ducks reared exclusively on vegetable     diet will have a whiter and more delicate flesh than those     allowed to feed on animal offal; while the flesh of birds     fattened on the latter food, will be firmer than that of those     which have only partaken of food of a vegetable nature.
10136-8{_}12091{_}ROAST DUCKS.
10136-8{_}12092{_}934.
10136-8{_}12093{_}INGREDIENTS.--A couple of ducks; sage-and-onion stuffing No.
10136-8{_}12094{_}504; a little flour.
10136-8{_}12095{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose ducks with plump bellies, and with thick and yellowish feet.
10136-8{_}12096{_}They should be trussed with the feet on, which should be scalded, and the skin peeled off, and then turned up close to the legs.
10136-8{_}12097{_}Run a skewer through the middle of each leg, after having drawn them as close as possible to the body, to plump up the breast, passing the same quite through the body.
10136-8{_}12098{_}Cut off the heads and necks, and the pinions at the first joint; bring these close to the sides, twist the feet round, and truss them at the back of the bird.
10136-8{_}12099{_}After the duck is stuffed, both ends should be secured with string, so as to keep in the seasoning.
10136-8{_}12100{_}[Illustration: ROAST DUCK.]
10136-8{_}12101{_}_Mode_.--To insure ducks being tender, never dress them the same day they are killed; and if the weather permits, they should hang a day or two.
10136-8{_}12102{_}Make a stuffing of sage and onion sufficient for one duck, and leave the other unseasoned, as the flavour is not liked by everybody.
10136-8{_}12103{_}Put them down to a brisk clear fire, and keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking.
10136-8{_}12104{_}A few minutes before serving, dredge them lightly with flour, to make them froth and look plump; and when the steam draws towards the fire, send them to table hot and quickly, with a good brown gravy poured _round_, but not _over_ the ducks, and a little of the same in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12105{_}When in season, green peas should invariably accompany this dish.
10136-8{_}12106{_}_Time_.--Full-grown ducks from 3/4 to 1 hour; ducklings from 25 to 35 minutes.
10136-8{_}12107{_}_Average cost_, from 2s.

10136-8{_}12109{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}12110{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12111{_}each.
10136-8{_}12112{_}_Sufficient_.--A.
10136-8{_}12113{_}couple of ducks for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}12114{_}_Seasonable_.--Ducklings from April to August; ducks from November to February.
10136-8{_}12115{_}_Note_.--Ducklings are trussed and roasted in the same manner, and served with the same sauces and accompaniments.
10136-8{_}12116{_}When in season, serve apple sauce.
10136-8{_}12117{_}[Illustration: ROUEN DUCKS.]
10136-8{_}12118{_}THE ROUEN DUCK.--The Rouen, or Rhone duck, is a large and     handsome variety, of French extraction.
10136-8{_}12119{_}The plumage of the Rouen     duck is somewhat sombre; its flesh is also much darker, and,     though of higher flavour, not near so delicate as that of our     own Aylesbury.
10136-8{_}12120{_}It is with this latter breed that the Rouen duck     is generally mated; and the result is said to be increase of     size and strength.
10136-8{_}12121{_}In Normandy and Brittany these ducks, as well     as other sorts, greatly abound; and the "duck-liver _pâtés_" are     there almost as popular as the _pâté de foie gras_ of Strasburg.
10136-8{_}12122{_}In order to bring the livers of the wretched duck to the     fashionable and unnatural size, the same diabolical cruelty is     resorted to as in the case of the Strasburg goose.
10136-8{_}12123{_}The poor     birds are _nailed_ by the feet to a board placed close to a     fire, and, in that position, plentifully supplied with food and     water.
10136-8{_}12124{_}In a few days, the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow,     while the liver has grown monstrously.
10136-8{_}12125{_}We would rather abstain     from the acquaintance of a man who ate _pâté de foie gras_,     knowing its component parts.
10136-8{_}12126{_}DUCK'S EGGS.--The ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a     tendency to curve upwards, are better layers than those whose     beaks do not thus point, is, we need hardly say, simply absurd:     all ducks are good layers, if they are carefully fed and tended.
10136-8{_}12127{_}Ducks generally lay at night, or early in the morning.
10136-8{_}12128{_}While     they are in perfect health, they will do this; and one of the     surest signs of indisposition, among birds of this class, is     irregularity in laying.
10136-8{_}12129{_}The eggs laid will approach nearly the     colour of the layer,--light-coloured ducks laying white eggs,     and brown ducks greenish-blue eggs; dark-coloured birds laying     the largest eggs.
10136-8{_}12130{_}One time of day the notion was prevalent that     a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own; and although this     is not true, it will be, nevertheless, as well to match the     duck's own eggs as closely as possible; for we have known     instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and     destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour.
10136-8{_}12131{_}DUCKS.--The Mallard, or Wild Duck, from which is derived the     domestic species, is prevalent throughout Europe, Asia, and     America.
10136-8{_}12132{_}The mallard's most remarkable characteristic is one     which sets at defiance the speculations of the most profound     ornithologist.
10136-8{_}12133{_}The female bird is extremely plain, but the     male's plumage is a splendour of greens and browns, and browns     and blues.
10136-8{_}12134{_}In the spring, however, the plumage of the male     begins to fade, and in two months, every vestige of his finery     has departed, and he is not to be distinguished from his     soberly-garbed wife.
10136-8{_}12135{_}Then the greens, and the blues, and the     browns begin to bud out again, and by October he is once more a     gorgeous drake.
10136-8{_}12136{_}It is to be regretted that domestication has     seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck.
10136-8{_}12137{_}In a     wild state, he is a faithful husband, desiring but one wife, and     devoting himself to her; but no sooner is he domesticated than     he becomes polygamous, and makes nothing of owning ten or a     dozen wives at a time.
10136-8{_}12138{_}As regards the females, they are much     more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild state     than a tame.
10136-8{_}12139{_}Should a tame duck's duckling get into mortal     trouble, its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra     "quack," or so, and a flapping of her wings; but touch a wild     duck's little one if you dare!
10136-8{_}12140{_}she will buffet you with her     broad wings, and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak.
10136-8{_}12141{_}If you search for her nest amongst the long grass, she will try     no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it, her favourite _ruse_     being to pretend lameness, to delude you into the notion that     you have only to pursue _her_ vigorously, and her capture is     certain; so you persevere for half a mile or so, and then she is     up and away, leaving you to find your way back to the nest if     you can.
10136-8{_}12142{_}Among the ancients, opinion was at variance respecting     the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh, but     concerning the excellence of the duck all parties were agreed;     indeed, they not only assigned to duck-meat the palm for     exquisite flavour and delicacy, they even attributed to it     medicinal powers of the highest order.
10136-8{_}12143{_}Not only the Roman     medical writers of the time make mention of it, but likewise the     philosophers of the period.
10136-8{_}12144{_}Plutarch assures us that Cato     preserved his whole household in health, in a season when plague     and disease were rife, through dieting them on roast duck.
10136-8{_}12145{_}STEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12146{_}935.
10136-8{_}12147{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12148{_}of butter, 3 or 4 slices of lean ham or bacon, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 2 pints of thin gravy, 1, or a small bunch of green onions, 3 sprigs of parsley, 3 cloves, 1 pint of young green peas, cayenne and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}12149{_}_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan; cut up the duck into joints, lay them in with the slices of lean ham or bacon; make it brown, then dredge in a tablespoonful of flour, and stir this well in before adding the gravy.
10136-8{_}12150{_}Put in the onion, parsley, cloves, and gravy, and when it has simmered for 1/4 hour, add a pint of young green peas, and stew gently for about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12151{_}Season with cayenne, salt, and sugar; take out the duck, place it round the dish, and the peas in the middle.
10136-8{_}12152{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}12153{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 1s.
10136-8{_}12154{_}_Seasonable_ from June to August.
10136-8{_}12155{_}DUCKS HATCHING.--Concerning incubation by ducks, a practised     writer says, "The duck requires a secret and safe place, rather     than any attendance, and will, at nature's call, cover her eggs     and seek her food.
10136-8{_}12156{_}On hatching, there is not often a necessity     for taking away any of the brood; and, having hatched, let the     mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time.
10136-8{_}12157{_}On her     moving with her brood, let a coop be prepared upon the short     grass, if the weather be fine, and under shelter, if otherwise."
10136-8{_}12158{_}COOPING AND FEEDING DUCKLINGS.--Brood ducks should be cooped at     some distance from any other.
10136-8{_}12159{_}A wide and flat dish of water, to     be often renewed, should stand just outside the coop, and     barley, or any other meal, be the first food of the ducklings.
10136-8{_}12160{_}It will be needful, if it be wet weather, to clip their tails,     lest these draggle, and so weaken the bird.
10136-8{_}12161{_}The period of the     duck's confinement to the coop will depend on the weather, and     on the strength of the ducklings.
10136-8{_}12162{_}A fortnight is usually the     extent of time necessary, and they may even be sometimes     permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at the end of a week.
10136-8{_}12163{_}They should not, however, be allowed to stay too long in the     water at first; for they will then become ill, their feathers     get rough, and looseness of the bowels ensue.
10136-8{_}12164{_}In the latter     case, let them be closely cooped for a few days, and bean-meal     or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food.
10136-8{_}12165{_}[Illustration: AYLESBURY DUCKS.]
10136-8{_}12166{_}THE AYLESBURY DUCK.--The white Aylesbury duck is, and     deservedly, a universal favourite.
10136-8{_}12167{_}Its snowy plumage and     comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry-yard,     while its broad and deep breast, and its ample back, convey the     assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death.
10136-8{_}12168{_}In     parts of Buckinghamshire, this member of the duck family is bred     on an extensive scale; not on plains and commons, however, as     might be naturally imagined, but in the abodes of the cottagers.
10136-8{_}12169{_}Round the walls of the living-rooms, and of the bedroom even,     are fixed rows of wooden boxes, lined with hay; and it is the     business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the     feathered lodgers, to feed the little ducklings, and to take the     old ones out for an airing.
10136-8{_}12170{_}Sometimes the "stock" ducks are the     cottager's own property, but it more frequently happens that     they are intrusted to his care by a wholesale breeder, who pays     him so much _per_ score for all ducklings properly raised.
10136-8{_}12171{_}To be     perfect, the Aylesbury duck should be plump, pure white, with     yellow feet, and a flesh-coloured beak.
10136-8{_}12172{_}STEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12173{_}936.
10136-8{_}12174{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 1/2 pint of good gravy, cayenne and salt to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 oz, of butter rolled in flour, 1-1/2 pint of green peas.
10136-8{_}12175{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the duck into joints, lay it in the gravy, and add a seasoning of cayenne, salt, and minced lemon-peel; let tins gradually warm through, but not boil.
10136-8{_}12176{_}Throw the peas into boiling water slightly salted, and boil them rapidly until tender.
10136-8{_}12177{_}Drain them, stir in the pounded sugar, and the butter rolled in flour; shake them over the fire for two or three minutes, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck laid round.
10136-8{_}12178{_}_Time_.--15 minutes to boil the peas, when they are full grown.
10136-8{_}12179{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 10d.
10136-8{_}12180{_}_Seasonable_ from June to August.
10136-8{_}12181{_}FATTENING DUCKS.--Many duck-keepers give their birds nothing in     the shape of food, letting them wander about and pick up a     living for themselves; and they will seem to get fat even upon     this precarious feeding.
10136-8{_}12182{_}Unless, however, ducks are supplied     with, besides chance food, a liberal feed of solid corn, or     grain, morning and evening, their flesh will become flabby and     insipid.
10136-8{_}12183{_}The simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as     much, substantial food as they will eat, bruised oats and     pea-meal being the standard fattening food for them.
10136-8{_}12184{_}No cramming     is required, as with the turkey and some other poultry: they     will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation.
10136-8{_}12185{_}At the     same time, plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their     service.
10136-8{_}12186{_}AMERICAN MODE OF CAPTURING DUCKS.--On the American rivers, the     modes of capture are various.
10136-8{_}12187{_}Sometimes half a dozen artificial     birds are fastened to a little raft, and which is so weighted     that the sham birds squat naturally on the water.
10136-8{_}12188{_}This is quite     sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock, who descend     to cultivate the acquaintance of the isolated few when the     concealed hunter, with his fowling-piece, scatters a deadly     leaden shower amongst them.
10136-8{_}12189{_}In the winter, when the water is     covered with rubble ice, the fowler of the Delaware paints his     canoe entirely white, lies flat in the bottom of it, and floats     with the broken ice; from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to     distinguish it.
10136-8{_}12190{_}So floats the canoe till he within it     understands, by the quacking, and fluttering, and whirring of     wings, that he is in the midst of a flock, when he is up in a     moment with the murderous piece, and dying quacks and     lamentations rend the still air.
10136-8{_}12191{_}[Illustration: BOW-BILL DUCKS.]
10136-8{_}12192{_}Bow-BILL DUCKS, &c.--Every one knows how awkward are the     _Anatidae_, waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes, and     their short legs, which, being placed considerably backward,     make the fore part of the body preponderate.
10136-8{_}12193{_}Some, however, are     formed more adapted to terrestrial habits than others, and     notably amongst these may be named _Dendronessa sponsa_, the     summer duck of America.
10136-8{_}12194{_}This beautiful bird rears her young in     the holes of trees, generally overhanging the water.
10136-8{_}12195{_}When strong     enough, the young scramble to the mouth of the hole, launch into     the air with their little wings and feet spread out, and drop     into their favourite element.
10136-8{_}12196{_}Whenever their birthplace is at     some distance from the water, the mother carries them to it, one     by one, in her bill, holding them so as not to injure their yet     tender frame.
10136-8{_}12197{_}On several occasions, however, when the hole was     30, 40, or more yards from a piece of water, Audubon observed     that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and     dried leaves beneath the tree, and afterwards led them directly     to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek.
10136-8{_}12198{_}There are some     curious varieties of the domestic duck, which only appear     interesting from their singularity, for there does not seem to     be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which     distinguish them; thus, the bow-bill duck, as shown in the     engraving, called by some writers the hook-bill, is remarkable     for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak, and the tuft     on the top of its head.
10136-8{_}12199{_}The penguin duck, again, waddles in an     upright position, like the penguin, on account of the unnatural     situation of its legs.
10136-8{_}12200{_}These odd peculiarities add nothing of     value to the various breeds, and may be set down as only the     result of accidental malformation, transmitted from generation     to generation.
10136-8{_}12201{_}STEWED DUCK AND TURNIPS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12202{_}937.
10136-8{_}12203{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 1/2 pint of good gravy, 4 shalots, a few slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury herbs, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}12204{_}of turnips, weighed after being peeled, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12205{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}12206{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the duck into joints, fry the shalots, carrots, and herbs, and put them, with the duck, into the gravy; add the pounded mace, and stew gently for 20 minutes or 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12207{_}Cut about 1 lb.
10136-8{_}12208{_}of turnips, weighed after being peeled, into 1/2-inch squares, put the butter into a stewpan, and stew them till quite tender, which will be in about 1/2 hour, or rather more; season with pepper and salt, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck, &c. laid round.
10136-8{_}12209{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour to stew the turnips.
10136-8{_}12210{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 1s.
10136-8{_}12211{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February.
10136-8{_}12212{_}THE WILD DUCK.--In many parts of England the wild duck is to be     found, especially in those desolate fenny parts where water     abounds.
10136-8{_}12213{_}In Lincolnshire they are plentiful, and are annually     taken in the decoys, which consist of ponds situate in the     marshes, and surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds     which frequent them from, being disturbed.
10136-8{_}12214{_}In these the birds     sleep during the day; and as soon as evening sets in, the _decoy     rises_, and the wild fowl feed during the night.
10136-8{_}12215{_}Now is the time     for the decoy ducks to entrap the others.
10136-8{_}12216{_}From the ponds     diverge, in different directions, certain canals, at the end of     which funnel nets are placed; along these the _decoy ducks_,     trained for the purpose, lead the others in search of food.
10136-8{_}12217{_}After they have got a certain length, a decoy-man appears, and     drives them further on, until they are finally taken in the     nets.
10136-8{_}12218{_}It is from these decoys, in Lincolnshire, that the London     market is mostly supplied.
10136-8{_}12219{_}The Chinese have a singular mode of     catching these ducks.
10136-8{_}12220{_}A person wades in the water up to the     chin, and, having his head covered with an empty calabash,     approaches the place where the ducks are.
10136-8{_}12221{_}As the birds have no     suspicion of the nature of the object which is concealed under     the calabash, they suffer its approach, and allow it to move at     will among their flock.
10136-8{_}12222{_}The man, accordingly, walks about in the     midst of his game, and, whenever he pleases, pulls them by the     legs under the water, and fixes them to his belt, until he has     secured as many as he requires, and then moves off as he went     amongst them, without exciting the slightest suspicion of the     trick he has been playing them.
10136-8{_}12223{_}This singular mode of     duck-hunting is also practised on the Ganges, the earthen     vessels of the Hindoos being used instead of calabashes.
10136-8{_}12224{_}These     vessels, being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice,     are considered, after once being used, as defiled, and are     accordingly thrown into the river.
10136-8{_}12225{_}The duck-takers, finding them     suitable for their purpose, put them on their heads; and as the     ducks, from seeing them constantly floating down the stream, are     familiar with their appearance, they regard them as objects from     which no danger is to be expected.
10136-8{_}12226{_}[Illustration: CALL-DUCKS.]
10136-8{_}12227{_}DUCK-SNARES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE FENS.--The following interesting     account of how duck-snaring used to be managed in the     Lincolnshire fens, was published some years ago, in a work     entitled the "Feathered Tribes."
10136-8{_}12228{_}--"In the lakes to which they     resorted, their favourite haunts were observed, and in the most     sequestered part of a haunt, a pipe or ditch was cut across the     entrance, decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the     further end, which was not more than two feet wide.
10136-8{_}12229{_}The ditch     was of a circular form, but did not bend much for the first ten     yards.
10136-8{_}12230{_}The banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept     clear of weeds and close herbage, in order that the ducks might     get on them to sit and dress themselves.
10136-8{_}12231{_}Along the ditch, poles     were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side, and     the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together.
10136-8{_}12232{_}The     poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch, and formed     an arch, the top of which was tea feet distant from the surface     of the water; the arch was made to decrease in height as the     ditch decreased in width, so that the remote end was not more     than eighteen inches in height.
10136-8{_}12233{_}The poles were placed about six     feet from each other, and connected by poles laid lengthwise     across the arch, and tied together.
10136-8{_}12234{_}Over the whole was thrown a     net, which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and     nine or ten yards up the ditch, and afterwards strongly pegged     to the ground.
10136-8{_}12235{_}At the end of the ditch furthest from the     entrance, was fixed what was called a tunnel-net, of about four     yards in length, of a round form, and kept open by a number of     hoops about eighteen inches in diameter, placed at a small     distance from each other to keep it distended.
10136-8{_}12236{_}Supposing the     circular bend of the ditch to be to the right, when one stands     with his back to the lake, then on the left-hand side, a number     of reed fences were constructed, called shootings, for the     purpose of screening the decoy-man from observation, and, in     such a manner, that the fowl in the decoy would not be alarmed     while he was driving those that were in the pipe.
10136-8{_}12237{_}These     shootings, which were ten in number, were about four yards in     length and about six feet high.
10136-8{_}12238{_}From the end of the last     shooting a person could not see the lake, owing to the bend of     the ditch; and there was then no further occasion for shelter.
10136-8{_}12239{_}Were it not for these shootings, the fowl that remained about     the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed, if the person     driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed,     and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place."
10136-8{_}12240{_}THE DECOY MAN, DOG, AND DUCKS.--"The first thing the decoy-man     did, on approaching the ditch, was to take a piece of lighted     peat or turf, and to hold it near his mouth, to prevent the     birds from smelling him.
10136-8{_}12241{_}He was attended by a dog trained to     render him assistance.
10136-8{_}12242{_}He walked very silently about halfway up     the shootings, where a small piece of wood was thrust through     the reed fence, which made an aperture just large enough to     enable him to see if there were any fowl within; if not, he     walked to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch.
10136-8{_}12243{_}If     there were, he stopped, made a motion to his dog, and gave him a     piece of cheese to eat, when the dog went directly to a hole     through the reed fence, and the birds immediately flew off the     back into the water.
10136-8{_}12244{_}The dog returned along the bank between the     reed fences, and came out to his master at another hole.
10136-8{_}12245{_}The man     then gave the dog something more to encourage him, and the dog     repeated his rounds, till the birds were attracted by his     motions, and followed him into the mouth of the ditch--an     operation which was called 'working them.'
10136-8{_}12246{_}The man now retreated     further back, working the dog at different holes, until the     ducks were sufficiently under the net.
10136-8{_}12247{_}He then commanded his dog     to lie down under the fence, and going himself forward to the     end of the ditch next the lake, he took off his hat, and gave it     a wave between the shootings.
10136-8{_}12248{_}All the birds that were under the     net could then see him, but none that were in the lake could.
10136-8{_}12249{_}The former flew forward, and the man then ran to the next     shooting, and waved his hat, and so on, driving them along until     they came into the tunnel-net, into which they crept.
10136-8{_}12250{_}When they     were all in, the man gave the net a twist, so as to prevent them     getting back.
10136-8{_}12251{_}He then took the net off from the end of the     ditch, and taking out, one by one, the ducks that were in it,     dislocated their necks."
10136-8{_}12252{_}BOILED FOWLS OR CHICKENS.
10136-8{_}12253{_}[Illustration: BOILED FOWL.]
10136-8{_}12254{_}938.
10136-8{_}12255{_}INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; water.
10136-8{_}12256{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--In choosing fowls for boiling, it should be borne in mind that those that are not black-legged are generally much whiter when dressed.
10136-8{_}12257{_}Pick, draw, singe, wash, and truss them in the following manner, without the livers in the wings; and, in drawing, be careful not to break the gall-bladder:--Cut off the neck, leaving sufficient skin to skewer back.
10136-8{_}12258{_}Cut the feet off to the first joint, tuck the stumps into a slit made on each side of the belly, twist the wings over the back of the fowl, and secure the top of the leg and the bottom of the wing together by running a skewer through them and the body.
10136-8{_}12259{_}The other side must be done in the same manner.
10136-8{_}12260{_}Should the fowl be very large and old, draw the sinews of the legs before tucking them in.
10136-8{_}12261{_}Make a slit in the apron of the fowl, large enough to admit the parson's nose, and tie a string on the tops of the legs to keep them in their proper place.
10136-8{_}12262{_}_Mode_.--When, they are firmly trussed, put them into a stewpan with plenty of hot water; bring it to boil, and carefully remove all the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}12263{_}_Simmer very gently_ until the fowl is tender, and bear in mind that the slower it boils, the plumper and whiter will the fowl be.
10136-8{_}12264{_}Many cooks wrap them in a floured cloth to preserve the colour, and to prevent the scum from clinging to them; in this case, a few slices of lemon should be placed on the breasts; over these a sheet of buttered paper, and then the cloth; cooking them in this manner renders the flesh very white.
10136-8{_}12265{_}Boiled ham, bacon, boiled tongue, or pickled pork, are the usual accompaniments to boiled fowls, and they may be served with Béchamel, white sauce, parsley and butter, oyster, lemon, liver, celery, or mushroom sauce.
10136-8{_}12266{_}A little should be poured over the fowls, after the skewers are removed, and the remainder sent in a tureen to table.
10136-8{_}12267{_}_Time_.--Large fowl, 1 hour; moderate-sized one, 3/4 hour; chicken, from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12268{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 5s.
10136-8{_}12269{_}the pair.
10136-8{_}12270{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}12271{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.
10136-8{_}12272{_}[Illustration: GAME-FOWLS.]
10136-8{_}12273{_}THE GAME FOWL.--Respecting the period at which this well-known     member of the _Gallus_ family became domesticated, history is     silent.
10136-8{_}12274{_}There is little doubt, however, that, like the dog, it     has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to     civilization.
10136-8{_}12275{_}Although the social position of this bird is, at     the present time, highly respectable, it is nothing to what it     was when Rome was mistress of the world.
10136-8{_}12276{_}Writing at that period,     Pliny says, respecting the domestic cock, "The gait of the cock     is proud and commanding; he walks with head erect and elevated     crest; alone, of all birds, he habitually looks up to the sky,     raising, at the same time, his curved and scythe-formed tail,     and inspiring terror in the lion himself, that most intrepid of     animals.----They regulate the conduct of our magistrates, and     open or close to them their own houses.
10136-8{_}12277{_}They prescribe rest or     movement to the Roman fasces: they command or prohibit battles.
10136-8{_}12278{_}In a word, they lord it over the masters of the world."
10136-8{_}12279{_}As well     among the ancient Greeks as the Romans, was the cock regarded     with respect, and even awe.
10136-8{_}12280{_}The former people practised     divinations by means of this bird.
10136-8{_}12281{_}Supposing there to be a doubt     in the camp as to the fittest day to fight a battle, the letter     of every day in the week would be placed face downwards, and a     grain of corn placed on each; then the sacred cock would be let     loose, and, according to the letters he pecked his corn from, so     would the battle-time be regulated.
10136-8{_}12282{_}On one momentous occasion,     however, a person inimical to priestly interest officiously     examined the grain, and found that those lying on the letters     not wanted were made of wax, and the birds, preferring the true     grain, left these untouched.
10136-8{_}12283{_}It is needless to add that, after     this, divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out     of fashion.
10136-8{_}12284{_}Whether or no the learned fowl above alluded to were     of the "game" breed, is unknown; but that the birds were bred     for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the     Christian era, there can be no doubt.
10136-8{_}12285{_}Themistocles, the Athenian     king, who flourished more than two thousand years ago, took     advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to     harangue his soldiers on courage.
10136-8{_}12286{_}"Observe," said he, "with what     intrepid valour they fight, inspired by no other motive than     lore of victory; whereas you have to contend for your religion     and your liberty, for your wives and children, and for the tombs     of your ancestors."
10136-8{_}12287{_}And to this day his courage has not     degenerated.
10136-8{_}12288{_}He still preserves his bold and elegant gait, his     sparkling eye, while his wedge-shaped beak and cruel spurs are     ever ready to support his defiant crow.
10136-8{_}12289{_}It is no wonder that the     breed is not plentiful--first, on account of the few eggs laid     by the hen; and, secondly, from the incurable pugnacity of the     chicks.
10136-8{_}12290{_}Half fledged broods may be found blind as bats from     fighting, and only waiting for the least glimmer of sight to be     at it again.
10136-8{_}12291{_}Without doubt, the flesh of game fowls is every way     superior to that of every chicken of the family.
10136-8{_}12292{_}BROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOM SAUCE.
10136-8{_}12293{_}939.
10136-8{_}12294{_}INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, seasoning, to taste, of pepper and salt, 2 handfuls of button mushrooms, 1 slice of lean ham, 3/4 pint of thickened gravy, 1 teaspoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}12295{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into quarters, roast it until three-parts done, and keep it well basted whilst at the fire.
10136-8{_}12296{_}Take the fowl up, broil it for a few minutes over a clear fire, and season it with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}12297{_}Have ready some mushroom sauce made in the following manner.
10136-8{_}12298{_}Put the mushrooms into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, the ham, a seasoning of pepper and salt, and the gravy; simmer these gently for 1/2 hour, add the lemon-juice and sugar, dish the fowl, and pour the sauce round them.
10136-8{_}12299{_}_Time_.--To roast the fowl, 35 minutes; to broil it, 10 to 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}12300{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 2s.
10136-8{_}12301{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12302{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}12303{_}_Seasonable_.--In full season from May to January.
10136-8{_}12304{_}[Illustration: BLACK BANTAMS.]
10136-8{_}12305{_}THE BANTAM.--No one will dispute that for beauty, animation,     plumage, and courage the Bantam is entitled to rank next to the     game fowl.
10136-8{_}12306{_}As its name undoubtedly implies, the bird is of     Asiatic origin.
10136-8{_}12307{_}The choicest sorts are the buff-coloured, and     those that are entirely black.
10136-8{_}12308{_}A year-old Bantam cock of pure     breed will not weigh more than sixteen ounces.
10136-8{_}12309{_}Despite its small     size, however, it is marvellously bold, especially in defence of     its progeny.
10136-8{_}12310{_}A friend of the writer's, residing at Kensington,     possessed a pair of thorough-bred Bantams, that were allowed the     range of a yard where a fierce bull-terrier was kennelled.
10136-8{_}12311{_}The     hen had chicks; and, when about three weeks old, one of them     strayed into the dog-kennel.
10136-8{_}12312{_}The grim beast within took no     notice of the tiny fledgling; but, when the anxious mother     ventured in to fetch out the truant, with a growl the dog woke,     and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws.
10136-8{_}12313{_}The cock bird     saw the tragic fate of its partner; but, nothing daunted, flew     at the dog with a fierce cry, and pecked savagely at its face.
10136-8{_}12314{_}The odds, however, were too great; and, when the terrier had     sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the     sudden and unexpected attack, he seized the audacious Bantam,     and shook him to death; and, in five minutes, the devoted couple     were entombed in _Pincher's_ capacious maw.
10136-8{_}12315{_}BOILED FOWL AND RICE.
10136-8{_}12316{_}940.
10136-8{_}12317{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, mutton broth, 2 onions, 2 small blades of pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1/4 pint of rice, parsley and butter.
10136-8{_}12318{_}_Mode_.--Truss the fowl as for boiling, and put it into a stewpan with sufficient clear well-skimmed mutton broth to cover it; add the onion, mace, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; stew very gently for about 1 hour, should the fowl be large, and about 1/2 hour before it is ready put in the rice, which should be well washed and soaked.
10136-8{_}12319{_}When the latter is tender, strain it from the liquor, and put it on a sieve reversed to dry before the fire, and, in the mean time, keep the fowl hot.
10136-8{_}12320{_}Dish it, put the rice round as a border, pour a little parsley and butter over the fowl, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12321{_}_Time_.--A large fowl, 1 hour.

10136-8{_}12326{_}[Illustration: DORKINGS.]
10136-8{_}12327{_}THE DORKING.--This bird takes its name from that of a town in     Surrey, where the breed is to be found in greater numbers, and     certainly in greater perfection, than elsewhere.
10136-8{_}12328{_}It is generally     believed that this particular branch of poultry was found in the     town above mentioned as long ago as the Roman era.
10136-8{_}12329{_}The Dorking's     chief characteristic is that he has five claws on each foot; the     extra claw, however, is never of sufficient length to encumber     the foot, or to cause it to "drag" its nest, or scratch out the     eggs.
10136-8{_}12330{_}The colour of the true Dorking is pure white; long in the     body, short in the legs, and a prolific layer.
10136-8{_}12331{_}Thirty years ago,     there was much controversy respecting the origin of the Dorking.
10136-8{_}12332{_}The men of Sussex declared that the bird belonged to them, and     brought birds indigenous to their weald, and possessing all the     Dorking fine points and peculiarities, in proof of the     declaration.
10136-8{_}12333{_}Others inclined to the belief that the Poland bird     was the father of the Dorking, and not without at least a show     of reason, as the former bird much resembles the latter in     shape; and, despite its sombre hue, it is well known that the     Poland cock will occasionally beget thorough white stock from     white English hens.
10136-8{_}12334{_}The commotion has, however, long ago     subsided, and Dorking still retains its fair reputation for     fowl.
10136-8{_}12335{_}CURRIED FOWL.
10136-8{_}12336{_}941.
10136-8{_}12337{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12338{_}of butter, 3 onions sliced, 1 pint of white veal gravy, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 apple, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}12339{_}_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan, with the onions sliced, the fowl cut into small joints, and the apple peeled, cored, and minced.
10136-8{_}12340{_}Fry of a pale brown, add the stock, and stew gently for 20 minutes; rub down the curry-powder and flour with a little of the gravy, quite smoothly, and stir this to the other ingredients; simmer for rather more than 1/2 hour, and just before serving, add the above proportion of hot cream and lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}12341{_}Serve with boiled rice, which may either be heaped lightly on a dish by itself, or put round the curry as a border.
10136-8{_}12342{_}_Time_.--50 minutes.

10136-8{_}12344{_}3d.

10136-8{_}12347{_}_Note_.--This curry may be made of cold chicken, but undressed meat will be found far superior.
10136-8{_}12348{_}THE POLAND.--This bird, a native of Holland, is a great     favourite with fowl-keepers, especially those who have on eye to     profit rather than to amusement.
10136-8{_}12349{_}Those varieties known as the     "silver spangled" and the "gold spangled" are handsome enough to     please the most fastidious; but the common black breed, with the     bushy crown of white feathers, is but a plain bird.
10136-8{_}12350{_}The chief     value of the common Poland lies in the great number of eggs they     produce; indeed, in many parts, they are as well known as     "everlasting layers" as by their proper name.
10136-8{_}12351{_}However, the     experienced breeder would take good care to send the eggs of his     everlasting layers to market, and not use them for home     consumption, as, although they may be as large as those laid by     other hens, the amount of nutriment contained in them is not     nearly so great.
10136-8{_}12352{_}Mr. Mowbray once kept an account of the number     of eggs produced by this prolific bird, with the following     result:--From the 25th of October to the 25th of the following     September five hens laid 503 eggs; the average weight of each     egg was one ounce five drachms, and the total weight of the     whole, exclusive of the shells, 50-1/4 pounds.
10136-8{_}12353{_}Taking the weight     of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each, we thus     see them producing within a year double their weight of egg     alone; and, supposing every egg to contain a chick, and allowing     the chick to, grow, in less than eighteen months from the laying     of the first egg, _two thousand five hundred pounds_ of     chicken-meat would be the result.
10136-8{_}12354{_}The Poland is easily fattened,     and its flesh is generally considered juicier and of richer     flavour than most others.

10136-8{_}12369{_}The     first pair that ever made their appearance here were natives of     Shanghai, and were presented to the queen, who exhibited them at     the Dublin poultry-show of 1818.
10136-8{_}12370{_}Then began the "Cochin"     _furor_.
10136-8{_}12371{_}As soon as it was discovered, despite the most     strenuous endeavours to keep the tremendous secret, that a     certain dealer was possessed of a pair of these birds,     straightway the avenues to that dealer's shop were blocked by     broughams, and chariots, and hack cabs, until the shy poulterer     had been tempted by a sufficiently high sum to part with his     treasure.
10136-8{_}12372{_}Bank-notes were exchanged for Cochin chicks, and     Cochin eggs were in as great demand as though they had been laid     by the fabled golden goose.
10136-8{_}12373{_}The reign of the Cochin China was,     however, of inconsiderable duration.
10136-8{_}12374{_}The bird that, in 1847,     would fetch thirty guineas, is now counted but ordinary     chicken-meat, and its price is regulated according to its weight     when ready for the spit.
10136-8{_}12375{_}As for the precious buff eggs, against     which, one time of day, guineas were weighed,--send for     sixpenn'orth at the cheesemonger's, and you will get at least     five; which is just as it should be.
10136-8{_}12376{_}For elegance of shape or     quality of flesh, the Cochin cannot for a moment stand     comparison with our handsome dunghill; neither can the     indescribable mixture of growling and braying, peculiar to the     former, vie with the musical trumpeting of our own morning     herald: yet our poultry-breeders have been immense gainers by     the introduction of the ungainly celestial, inasmuch as _new     blood_ has been infused into the English chicken family.
10136-8{_}12377{_}Of this     incalculable advantage we may be sure; while, as to the Cochin's     defects, they are certain to be lost in the process of "cross     and cross" breeding.
10136-8{_}12378{_}BOILED FOWLS A LA BECHAMEL.
10136-8{_}12379{_}943.
10136-8{_}12380{_}INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel, No, 367, a few bunches of boiled brocoli or cauliflower.
10136-8{_}12381{_}_Mode_.--Truss and boil the fowls by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12382{_}938; make a pint of Béchamel sauce by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12383{_}367; pour some of this over the fowls, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12384{_}Garnish the dish with bunches of boiled cauliflowers or brocoli, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}12385{_}The sauce should be made sufficiently thick to adhere to the fowls; that for the tureen should be thinned by adding a spoonful or two of stock.
10136-8{_}12386{_}_Time_.--From 1/2 to 1 hour, according to size.
10136-8{_}12387{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 5s.
10136-8{_}12388{_}a pair.
10136-8{_}12389{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}12390{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.
10136-8{_}12391{_}SPACE FOR FOWLS.--We are no advocates for converting the     domestic fowl into a cage-bird.
10136-8{_}12392{_}We have known amateur     fowl-keepers--worthy souls, who would butter the very barley     they gave their pets, if they thought they would the more enjoy     it--coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary     egg-chest placed on its side, and with the front closely barred     with iron hooping!
10136-8{_}12393{_}This system will not do.
10136-8{_}12394{_}Every animal, from     man himself to the guinea-pig, must have what is vulgarly, but     truly, known as "elbow-room;" and it must be self-evident how     emphatically this rule applies to winged animals.
10136-8{_}12395{_}It may be     urged, in the case of domestic fowls, that from constant disuse,     and from clipping and plucking, and other sorts of maltreatment,     their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of flight; we     maintain, however, that you may pluck a fowl's wing-joints as     bare as a pumpkin, but you will not erase from his memory that     he is a fowl, and that his proper sphere is the open air.
10136-8{_}12396{_}If he     likewise reflects that he is an ill-used fowl--a prison-bird--he     will then come to the conclusion, that there is not the least     use, under such circumstances, for his existence; and you must     admit that the decision is only logical and natural.
10136-8{_}12397{_}BOILED FOWL, with Oysters.
10136-8{_}12398{_}(_Excellent_.)
10136-8{_}12399{_}944.
10136-8{_}12400{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 young fowl, 3 dozen oysters, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/4 pint of cream.
10136-8{_}12401{_}_Mode_.--Truss a young fowl as for boiling; fill the inside with oysters which have been bearded and washed in their own liquor; secure the ends of the fowl, put it into a jar, and plunge the jar into a saucepan of boiling water.
10136-8{_}12402{_}Keep it boiling for 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer; then take the gravy that has flowed from the oysters and fowl, of which there will be a good quantity; stir in the cream and yolks of eggs, add a few oysters scalded in their liquor; let the sauce get quite _hot_, but do not allow it to _boil;_ pour some of it over the fowl, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12403{_}A blade of pounded mace added to the sauce, with the cream and eggs, will be found an improvement.
10136-8{_}12404{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12405{_}Average cost, 4s.
10136-8{_}12406{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12407{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}12408{_}_Seasonable_ from September to April.
10136-8{_}12409{_}THE FOWL-HOUSE.--In building a fowl-house, take care that it be,     if possible, built against a wall or fence that faces the     _south_, and thus insure its inmates against many cold winds,     driving rains, and sleets they will otherwise suffer.
10136-8{_}12410{_}Let the     floor of the house slope half an inch to the foot from back to     front, so as to insure drainage; let it also be close, hard, and     perfectly smooth; so that it may be cleanly swept out.
10136-8{_}12411{_}A capital     plan is to mix a few bushels of chalk and dry earth, spread it     over the floor, and pay a paviour's labourer a trifle to hammer     it level with his rammer.
10136-8{_}12412{_}The fowl-house should be seven feet     high, and furnished with perches at least two feet apart.
10136-8{_}12413{_}The     perches must be level, and not one above the other, or     unpleasant consequences may ensue to the undermost row.
10136-8{_}12414{_}The     perches should be ledged (not fixed--just dropped into sockets,     that they may be easily taken out and cleaned) not lower than     five feet from the ground, convenient slips of wood being driven     into the wall, to render the ascent as easy as possible.
10136-8{_}12415{_}The     front of the fowl-house should be latticed, taking care that the     interstices be not wide enough even to tempt a chick to crawl     through.
10136-8{_}12416{_}Nesting-boxes, containing soft hay, and fitted against     the walls, so as to be easily reached by the perch-ladder,     should be supplied.
10136-8{_}12417{_}It will be as well to keep by you a few     portable doors, so that you may hang one before the entrance to     a nesting-box, when the hen goes in to sit.
10136-8{_}12418{_}This will prevent     other hens from intruding, a habit to which some are much     addicted.
10136-8{_}12419{_}FRICASSEED FOWL OR CHICKEN (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12420{_}945.
10136-8{_}12421{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 small fowls or 1 large one, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}12422{_}of butter, a bunch of parsley and green onions, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, 1 shalot, 1 bay-leaf, salt and white pepper to taste, 1/4 pint of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs.
10136-8{_}12423{_}_Mode_.--Choose a couple of fat plump chickens, and, after drawing, singeing, and washing them, skin, and carve them into joints; blanch these in boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes; take them out, and immerse them in cold water to render them white.
10136-8{_}12424{_}Put the trimmings, with the necks and legs, into a stewpan; add the parsley, onions, clove, mace, shalot, bay-leaf, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pour to these the water that the chickens were blanched in, and simmer gently for rather more than 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12425{_}Have ready another stewpan; put in the joints of fowl, with the above proportion of butter; dredge them with flour, let them get hot, but do not brown them much; then moisten the fricassee with the gravy made from the trimmings, &c., and stew very gently for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12426{_}Lift the fowl into another stewpan, skim the sauce, reduce it quickly over the fire, by letting it boil fast, and strain it over them.
10136-8{_}12427{_}Add the cream, and a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne; let it boil up, and when ready to serve, stir to it the well-beaten yolks of 3 eggs: these should not be put in till the last moment, and the sauce should be made _hot_, but must _not boil_, or it will instantly curdle.
10136-8{_}12428{_}A few button-mushrooms stewed with the fowl are by many persons considered an improvement.
10136-8{_}12429{_}_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/2 hour to simmer the fowl.
10136-8{_}12430{_}_Average cost_, 5s.
10136-8{_}12431{_}the pair.
10136-8{_}12432{_}_Sufficient_.--1 large fowl for one entrée.
10136-8{_}12433{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12434{_}STOCKING THE FOWL-HOUSE.--Take care that the birds with which     you stock your house are _young_.
10136-8{_}12435{_}The surest indications of old     age are fading of the comb and gills from brilliant red to a     dingy brick-colour, general paleness of plumage, brittleness of     the feathers, length and size of the claws, and the scales of     the legs and feet assuming a ragged and _corny_ appearance.
10136-8{_}12436{_}Your     cock and hens should be as near two years old as possible.
10136-8{_}12437{_}Hens     will lay at a year old, but the eggs are always insignificant in     size, and the layers giddy and unsteady sitters.
10136-8{_}12438{_}The hen-bird is     in her prime for breeding at three years old, and will continue     so, under favourable circumstances, for two years longer; after     which she will decline.
10136-8{_}12439{_}Crowing hens, and those that have large     combs, are generally looked on with mistrust; but this is mere     silliness and superstition--though it is possible that a spruce     young cock would as much object to a spouse with such peculiar     addictions, as a young fellow of our own species would to a     damsel who whistled and who wore whiskers.
10136-8{_}12440{_}Fowls with yellow     legs should be avoided; they are generally of a tender     constitution, loose-fleshed, and of indifferent flavour.
10136-8{_}12441{_}FRICASSEED FOWL (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12442{_}946.
10136-8{_}12443{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, popper and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1/4 pint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}12444{_}_Mode_.--Carve the fowls into nice joints; make gravy of the trimmings and legs, by stewing them with the lemon-peel, mace, herbs, onion, seasoning, and water, until reduced to 1/2 pint; then strain, and put in the fowl.
10136-8{_}12445{_}Warm it through, and thicken with a teaspoonful of flour; stir the yolks of the eggs into the cream; add these to the sauce, let it get thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}12446{_}_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/4 hour to warm the fowl.
10136-8{_}12447{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.
10136-8{_}12448{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12449{_}CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH AND POWER.--The chief characteristics     of health in a fowl are brightness and dryness of eye and     nostrils, the comb and wattles firm and ruddy, the feathers     elastic and glossy.
10136-8{_}12450{_}The most useful cock is generally the     greatest tyrant, who struts among his hens despotically, with     his head erect and his eyes ever watchful.
10136-8{_}12451{_}There is likely to be     handsomer and stronger chicks in a house where a bold,     active--even savage--bird reigns, than where the lord of the     hen-house is a weak, meek creature, who bears the abuse and     peckings of his wives without a remonstrance.
10136-8{_}12452{_}I much prefer     dark-coloured cock-birds to those of light plumage.
10136-8{_}12453{_}A cock, to     be handsome, should be of middling size; his bill should be     short, comb bright-red, wattles large, breast broad, and wings     strong.
10136-8{_}12454{_}His head should be rather small than otherwise, his legs     short and sturdy, and his spurs well-formed; his feathers should     be short and close, and the more frequently and heartily he     crows, the better father he is likely to become.
10136-8{_}12455{_}The common     error of choosing hens _above_ the ordinary stature of their     respective varieties should be avoided, as the best     breeding-hens are those of medium size.
10136-8{_}12456{_}FRIED FOWLS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12457{_}I.
10136-8{_}12458{_}947.
10136-8{_}12459{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, vinegar, salt and cayenne to taste, 3 or 4 minced shalots.
10136-8{_}12460{_}For the batter,--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}12461{_}of flour, 1/2 pint of hot water, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12462{_}of butter, the whites of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}12463{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into nice joints; steep them for an hour in a little vinegar, with salt, cayenne, and minced shalots.
10136-8{_}12464{_}Make the batter by mixing the flour and water smoothly together; melt in it the butter, and add the whites of egg beaten to a froth; take out the pieces of fowl, dip them in the batter, and fry, in boiling lard, a nice brown.
10136-8{_}12465{_}Pile them high in the dish, and garnish with fried parsley or rolled bacon.
10136-8{_}12466{_}When approved, a sauce or gravy may be served with them.
10136-8{_}12467{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the fowl.
10136-8{_}12468{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 8d.
10136-8{_}12469{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12470{_}CHANTICLEER AND HIS COMPANIONS.--On bringing the male and female     birds together for the first time, it will be necessary to watch     the former closely, as it is a very common occurrence with him     to conceive a sudden and violent dislike for one or more of his     wives, and not allow the obnoxious ones to approach within some     distance of the others; indeed, I know many cases where the     capricious tyrant has set upon the innocent cause of his     resentment and killed her outright.
10136-8{_}12471{_}In all such cases, the hen     objected to should be removed and replaced by another.
10136-8{_}12472{_}If the     cock should, by any accident, get killed, considerable delicacy     is required in introducing a new one.
10136-8{_}12473{_}The hens may mope, and     refuse to associate with their new husband, clustering in     corners, and making odious comparisons between him and the     departed; or the cock may have his own peculiar notions as to     what a wife should be, and be by no means satisfied with those     you have provided him.
10136-8{_}12474{_}The plan is, to keep him by himself     nearly the whole day, supplying him plentifully with     exhilarating food, then to turn him loose among the hens, and to     continue this practice, allowing him more of the society of his     wives each day, until you suffer him to abide with them     altogether.
10136-8{_}12475{_}II.
10136-8{_}12476{_}948.
10136-8{_}12477{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, vinegar, salt and cayenne to taste, 4 minced shalots, yolk of egg; to every teacupful of bread crumbs allow 1 blade of pounded mace, 5 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne.
10136-8{_}12478{_}_Mode_.--Steep the pieces of fowl as in the preceding recipe, then dip them into the yolk of an egg or clarified butter; sprinkle over bread crumbs with which have been mixed salt, mace, cayenne, and lemon-peel in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}12479{_}Fry a light brown, and serve with or without gravy, as may be preferred.
10136-8{_}12480{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the fowl.
10136-8{_}12481{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 6d.
10136-8{_}12482{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12483{_}VARIOUS MODES OF FATTENING FOWLS.--It would, I think, be a     difficult matter to find, among the entire fraternity of     fowl-keepers, a dozen whose mode of fattening "stock" is the     same.
10136-8{_}12484{_}Some say that the grand f secret is to give them abundance     of saccharine food; others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped     in milk; while another breeder, celebrated in his day, and the     recipient of a gold medal from a learned society, says, "The     best method is as follows:-The chickens are to be taken from the     hen the night after they are hatched, and fed with eggs     hard-boiled, chopped, and mixed with crumbs of bread, as larks     and other small birds are fed, for the first fortnight; after     which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble, of     which the chickens are very fond, and thrive so fast that, at     the end of two months, they will be as large as full-grown     fowls."
10136-8{_}12485{_}Others there are who insist that nothing beats     oleaginous diet, and cram their birds with ground oats and suet.
10136-8{_}12486{_}But, whatever the course of diet favoured, on one point they     seem agreed; and that is, that, while fattening, the fowls     _should be kept in the dark_.
10136-8{_}12487{_}Supposing the reader to be a     dealer--a breeder of gross chicken meat for the market (against     which supposition the chances are 10,000 to 1), and beset with     as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster, the advice is     valuable.
10136-8{_}12488{_}"Laugh and grow fat" is a good maxim enough; but     "Sleep and grow fat" is, as is well known to folks of porcine     attributes, a better.
10136-8{_}12489{_}The poor birds, immured in their dark     dungeons, ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad, tuck     their heads under their wings and make a long night of it; while     their digestive organs, having no harder work than to pile up     fat, have an easy time enough.
10136-8{_}12490{_}But, unless we are mistaken, he     who breeds poultry for his own eating, bargains for a more     substantial reward than the questionable pleasure of burying his     carving-knife in chicken grease.
10136-8{_}12491{_}Tender, delicate, and     nutritious flesh is the great aim; and these qualities, I can     affirm without fear of contradiction, were never attained by a     dungeon-fatted chicken: perpetual gloom and darkness is as     incompatible with chicken life as it is with human.
10136-8{_}12492{_}If you wish     to be convinced of the absurdity of endeavouring to thwart     nature's laws, plant a tuft of grass, or a cabbage-plant, in the     darkest corner of your coal-cellar.
10136-8{_}12493{_}The plant or the tuft may     increase in length and breadth, but its colour will be as wan     and pale, almost, as would be your own face under the     circumstances.
10136-8{_}12494{_}POULET A LA MARENGO.
10136-8{_}12495{_}949.
10136-8{_}12496{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 large fowl, 4 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}12497{_}105, or water, about 20 mushroom-buttons, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a very small piece of garlic.
10136-8{_}12498{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into 8 or 10 pieces; put them with the oil into a stewpan, and brown them over a moderate fire; dredge in the above proportion of flour; when that is browned, pour in the stock or water; let it simmer very slowly for rather more than 1/2 hour, and skim off the fat as it rises to the top; add the mushrooms; season with salt, pepper, garlic, and sugar; take out the fowl, which arrange pyramidically on the dish, with the inferior joints at the bottom.
10136-8{_}12499{_}Reduce the sauce by boiling it quickly over the fire, keeping it stirred until sufficiently thick to adhere to the back of a spoon; pour over the fowl, and serve.
10136-8{_}12500{_}_Time_.--Altogether 50 minutes.
10136-8{_}12501{_}_Average cost_, 3s.
10136-8{_}12502{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12503{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}12504{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12505{_}A FOWL À LA MARENGO.--The following is the origin of the     well-known dish Poulet à la Marengo:--On the evening of the     battle the first consul was very hungry after the agitation of     the day, and a fowl was ordered with all expedition.
10136-8{_}12506{_}The fowl     was procured, but there was no butter at hand, and unluckily     none could be found in the neighbourhood.
10136-8{_}12507{_}There was oil in     abundance, however; and the cook having poured a certain     quantity into his skillet, put in the fowl, with a clove of     garlic and other seasoning, with a little white wine, the best     the country afforded; he then garnished it with mushrooms, and     served it up hot.
10136-8{_}12508{_}This dish proved the second conquest of the     day, as the first consul found it most agreeable to his palate,     and expressed his satisfaction.
10136-8{_}12509{_}Ever since, a fowl à la Marengo     is a favourite dish with all lovers of good cheer.
10136-8{_}12510{_}MINCED FOWL A LA BECHAMEL.
10136-8{_}12511{_}950.
10136-8{_}12512{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 6 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel sauce No.
10136-8{_}12513{_}367, 6 tablespoonfuls of white stock No.
10136-8{_}12514{_}107, the white of 1 egg, bread crumbs, clarified butter.
10136-8{_}12515{_}_Mode_.--Take the remains of roast fowls, mince the white meat very small, and put it into a stewpan with the Béchamel and stock; stir it well over the fire, and just let it boil up.
10136-8{_}12516{_}Pour the mince into a dish, beat up the white of egg, spread it over, and strew on it a few grated bread crumbs; pour a very little clarified butter on the whole, and brown either before the fire or with a salamander.

10136-8{_}12520{_}THE BEST WAY TO FATTEN FOWLS.--The barn-door fowl is in itself a     complete refutation of the cramming and dungeon policy of     feeding practised by some.
10136-8{_}12521{_}This fowl, which has the common run     of the farm-yard, living on dairy-scraps and offal from the     stable, begins to grow fat at threshing-time.
10136-8{_}12522{_}He has his fill of     the finest corn; he has his fill of fresh air and natural     exercise, and at last he comes smoking to the table,--a dish     for the gods.
10136-8{_}12523{_}In the matter of unnaturally stuffing and     confining fowls, Mowbray is exactly of our opinion.
10136-8{_}12524{_}He says:     "The London chicken-butchers, as they are termed, are said to     be, of all others, the most expeditious and dexterous feeders,     putting up a coop of fowls, and making them thoroughly fat     within the space of a fortnight, using much grease, and that     perhaps not of the most delicate kind, in the food.
10136-8{_}12525{_}In this way     I have no boasts to make, having always found it necessary to     allow a considerable number of weeks for the purpose of making     fowls fat in coops.
10136-8{_}12526{_}In the common way this business is often     badly managed, fowls being huddled together in a small coop,     tearing each other to pieces, instead of enjoying that repose     which alone can insure, the wished-for object--irregularly fed     and cleaned, until they become so stenched and poisoned in their     own excrement, that their flesh actually smells and tastes when     smoking upon the table."
10136-8{_}12527{_}Sussex produces the fattest and largest     poultry of any county in England, and the fatting process there     most common is to give them a gruel made of pot-liquor and     bruised oats, with which are mixed hog's grease, sugar, and     milk.
10136-8{_}12528{_}The fowls are kept very warm, and crammed morning and     night.
10136-8{_}12529{_}They are put into the coop, and kept there two or three     days before the cramming begins, and then it is continued for a     fortnight, and the birds are sent to market.
10136-8{_}12530{_}RAGOUT OF FOWL.
10136-8{_}12531{_}951.
10136-8{_}12532{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 3 shalots, 2 blades of mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 or three slices of lean ham, 1 pint of stock or water, pepper and salt to taste, 1 onion, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}12533{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}12534{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowls up into neat pieces, the same as for a fricassee; put the trimmings into a stewpan with the shalots, mace, herbs, ham, onion, and stock (water may be substituted for this).
10136-8{_}12535{_}Boil it slowly for 1 hour, strain the liquor, and put a small piece of butter into a stewpan; when melted, dredge in sufficient flour to dry up the butter, and stir it over the fire.
10136-8{_}12536{_}Put in the strained liquor, boil for a few minutes, and strain it again over the pieces of fowl.
10136-8{_}12537{_}Squeeze in the lemon-juice, add the sugar and a seasoning of pepper and salt, make it hot, but do not allow it to boil; lay the fowl neatly on the dish, and garnish with croûtons.
10136-8{_}12538{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12539{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 9d.
10136-8{_}12540{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12541{_}THE BEST FOWLS TO FATTEN, &c.--The chicks most likely to fatten     well are those first hatched in the brood, and those with the     shortest legs.
10136-8{_}12542{_}Long-legged fowls, as a rule, are by far the most     difficult to fatten.
10136-8{_}12543{_}The most delicate sort are those which are     put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them; for, as says     an old writer, "then they will be in fine condition, and full of     flesh, which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of     foraging for food, and in the increase of stature; and it may be     a work of some weeks to recover it,--especially with young     cocks."
10136-8{_}12544{_}But whether you take them in hand as chicks, or not till     they are older, the three prime rules to be observed are, sound     and various food, warmth, and cleanliness.
10136-8{_}12545{_}There is nothing that     a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water.
10136-8{_}12546{_}If water     any way foul be offered him, he will not drink it, but sulk with     his food, and pine, and you all the while wondering the reason     why.
10136-8{_}12547{_}Keep them separate, allowing to each bird as much space as     you can spare.
10136-8{_}12548{_}Spread the ground with sharp sandy gravel; take     care that they are not disturbed.
10136-8{_}12549{_}In addition to their regular     diet of good corn, make them a cake of ground oats or beans,     brown sugar, milk, and mutton suet.
10136-8{_}12550{_}Let the cake lie till it is     stale, then crumble it, and give each bird a gill-measureful     morning and evening.
10136-8{_}12551{_}No entire grain should be given to fowls     during the time they are fattening; indeed, the secret of     success lies in supplying them with the most nutritious food     without stint, and in such a form that their digestive mills     shall find no difficulty in grinding it.
10136-8{_}12552{_}[Illustration: ROAST FOWL.]
10136-8{_}12553{_}ROAST FOWLS.
10136-8{_}12554{_}952.
10136-8{_}12555{_}INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; a little flour.
10136-8{_}12556{_}_Mode_.--Fowls to be tender should be killed a couple of days before they are dressed; when the feathers come out easily, then let them be picked and cooked.
10136-8{_}12557{_}In drawing them, be careful not to break the gall-bag, as, wherever it touches, it would impart a very bitter taste; the liver and gizzard should also be preserved.
10136-8{_}12558{_}Truss them in the following manner:--After having carefully picked them, cut off the head, and skewer the skin of the neck down over the back.
10136-8{_}12559{_}Cut off the claws; dip the legs in boiling water, and scrape them; turn the pinions under, run a skewer through them and the middle of the legs, which should be passed through the body to the pinion and leg on the other side, one skewer securing the limbs on both sides.
10136-8{_}12560{_}The liver and gizzard should be placed in the wings, the liver on one side and the gizzard on the other.
10136-8{_}12561{_}Tie the legs together by passing a trussing-needle, threaded with twine, through the backbone, and secure it on the other side.
10136-8{_}12562{_}If trussed like a capon, the legs are placed more apart.
10136-8{_}12563{_}When firmly trussed, singe them all over; put them down to a bright clear fire, paper the breasts with a sheet of buttered paper, and keep the fowls well basted.
10136-8{_}12564{_}Roast them for 3/4 hour, more or less, according to the size, and 10 minutes before serving, remove the paper, dredge the fowls with a little fine flour, put a piece of butter into the basting-ladle, and as it melts, baste the fowls with it; when nicely frothed and of a rich colour, serve with good brown gravy, a little of which should be poured over the fowls, and a tureen of well-made bread sauce, No.
10136-8{_}12565{_}371.
10136-8{_}12566{_}Mushroom, oyster, or egg sauce are very suitable accompaniments to roast fowl.--Chicken is roasted in the same manner.
10136-8{_}12567{_}_Time_.--A very large fowl, quite 1 hour, medium-sized one 3/4 hour, chicken 1/2 hour, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}12568{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 5s.
10136-8{_}12569{_}a pair; when scarce, 7s.

10136-8{_}12572{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}12573{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.
10136-8{_}12574{_}THE DISEASES OF FOWLS, AND HOW TO CURE THEM.--The diseases to     which _Gallus domesticus_ is chiefly liable, are roup, pip,     scouring, and chip.
10136-8{_}12575{_}The first-mentioned is the most common of     all, and results from cold.
10136-8{_}12576{_}The ordinary symptoms,--swollen     eyes, running at the nostrils, and the purple colour of the     wattles.
10136-8{_}12577{_}Part birds so affected from the healthy ones, as, when     the disease is at its height it is as contagious as glanders     among horses.
10136-8{_}12578{_}Wash out the nostrils with warm water, give daily     a peppercorn inclosed in dough; bathe the eyes and nostrils with     warm milk and water.
10136-8{_}12579{_}If the head is much swollen, bathe with     warm brandy and water.
10136-8{_}12580{_}When the bird is getting well, put half a     spoonful of sulphur in his drinking-water.
10136-8{_}12581{_}Some fanciers     prescribe for this disease half a spoonful of table salt,     dissolved in half a gill of water, in which rue has been     steeped; others, pills composed of ground rice and fresh butter:     but the remedy first mentioned will be found far the best.
10136-8{_}12582{_}As     there is a doubt respecting the wholesomeness of the eggs laid     by roupy hens, it will be as well to throw them away.
10136-8{_}12583{_}The pip is     a white horny skin growing on the tip of the bird's tongue.
10136-8{_}12584{_}It     should be removed with the point of a penknife, and the place     rubbed with salt.
10136-8{_}12585{_}FOWL AND RICE CROQUETTES (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12586{_}953.
10136-8{_}12587{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}12588{_}of rice, 1 quart of stock or broth, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}12589{_}of butter, minced fowl, egg, and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}12590{_}_Mode_.--Put the rice into the above proportion of cold stock or broth, and let it boil very gently for 1/2 hour; then add the butter, and simmer it till quite dry and soft When cold, make it into balls, hollow out the inside, and fill with minced fowl made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12591{_}956.
10136-8{_}12592{_}The mince should be rather thick.
10136-8{_}12593{_}Cover over with rice, dip the balls into egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry a nice brown.
10136-8{_}12594{_}Dish them, and garnish with fried parsley.
10136-8{_}12595{_}Oysters, white sauce, or a little cream, may be stirred into the rice before it cools.
10136-8{_}12596{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to boil the rice, 10 minutes to fry the croquettes.
10136-8{_}12597{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.
10136-8{_}12598{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12599{_}CHIP.--If the birds are allowed to puddle about on wet soil, or     to be much out in the rain, they will get "chip."
10136-8{_}12600{_}Young chicks     are especially liable to this complaint.
10136-8{_}12601{_}They will sit shivering     in out-of-the-way corners, perpetually uttering a dolorous     "chip, chip;" seemingly frozen with cold, though, on handling     them, they are found to be in high fever.
10136-8{_}12602{_}A wholesale breeder     would take no pains to attempt the cure of fowls so afflicted;     but they who keep chickens for the pleasure, and not for the     profit they yield, will be inclined to recover them if possible.
10136-8{_}12603{_}Give them none but warm food, half a peppercorn rolled in a     morsel of dough every night, and a little nitre in their water.
10136-8{_}12604{_}Above all, keep them warm; a corner in the kitchen fender, for a     day or two, will do more to effect a cure than the run of a     druggist's warehouse.
10136-8{_}12605{_}CROQUETTES OF FOWL (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12606{_}954.
10136-8{_}12607{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 shalots, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}12608{_}of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, white sauce; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste; 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, the remains of cold roast fowls, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg, and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}12609{_}_Mode_.--Mince the fowl, carefully removing all skin and bone, and fry the shalots in the butter; add the minced fowl, dredge in the flour, put in the pepper, salt, mace, pounded sugar, and sufficient white sauce to moisten it; stir to it the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs, and set it by to cool.
10136-8{_}12610{_}Then make the mixture up into balls, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry a nice brown.
10136-8{_}12611{_}They may be served on a border of mashed potatoes, with gravy or sauce in the centre.
10136-8{_}12612{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the balls.
10136-8{_}12613{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12614{_}THE TURN.--What is termed "turrling" with song-birds, is known,     as regard fowls, as the "turn."
10136-8{_}12615{_}Its origin is the same in both     cases,--over-feeing and want of exercise.
10136-8{_}12616{_}Without a moment's     warning, a fowl so afflicted will totter and fall from its     perch, and unless assistance be at hand, speedily give up the     ghost.
10136-8{_}12617{_}The veins of the palate should be opened, and a few drops     of mixture composed of six parts of sweet nitre and one of     ammonia, poured down its throat.
10136-8{_}12618{_}I have seen ignorant keepers     plunge a bird, stricken with the "turn," into cold water; but I     never saw it taken out again alive; and for a good reason: the     sudden chill has the effect of driving the blood to the     head,--of aggravating the disease indeed, instead of relieving     it.
10136-8{_}12619{_}HASHED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12620{_}955.
10136-8{_}12621{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 pint of water, 1 onion, 2 or three small carrots, 1 blade of pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, thickening of butter and flour, 1-1/2 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}12622{_}_Mode_.--Cut off the best joints from the fowl, and the remainder make into gravy, by adding to the bones and trimmings a pint of water, an onion sliced and fried of a nice brown, the carrots, mace, seasoning, and herbs.
10136-8{_}12623{_}Let these stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, strain the liquor, and thicken with a little flour and butter.
10136-8{_}12624{_}Lay in the fowl, thoroughly warm it through, add the ketchup, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}12625{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1-3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}12626{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 4d.
10136-8{_}12627{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12628{_}SKIN-DISEASE IN FOWLS.--Skin-disease is, nine times out of ten,     caused by the feathers being swarmed by parasites.
10136-8{_}12629{_}Poor feeding     will induce this, even if cleanliness be observed;     uncleanliness, however liberal the bill of fare, will be taken     as an invitation by the little biting pests, and heartily     responded to.
10136-8{_}12630{_}Mix half a teaspoonful of hydro-oxalic acid with     twelve teaspoonfuls of water,--apply to the itching parts with     an old shaving-brush.
10136-8{_}12631{_}OBSTRUCTION OF THE CROP.--Obstruction of the crop is occasioned     by weakness or greediness.
10136-8{_}12632{_}You may know when a bird is so     afflicted by his crop being distended almost to bursting.
10136-8{_}12633{_}Mowbray tells of a hen of his in this predicament; when the crop     was opened, a quantity of new beans were discovered in a state     of vegetation.
10136-8{_}12634{_}The crop should be slit from the _bottom_ to the     _top_ with a sharp pair of scissors, the contents taken out, and     the slit sewed up again with line white thread.
10136-8{_}12635{_}MINCED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12636{_}956.
10136-8{_}12637{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 hard-boiled eggs, salt, cayenne, and pounded mace, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}12638{_}of butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}12639{_}_Mode_.--Cut out from the fowl all the white meat, and mince it finely without any skin or bone; put the bones, skin, and trimmings into a stewpan with an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a blade of mace, and nearly a pint of water; let this stew for an hour, then strain the liquor.
10136-8{_}12640{_}Chop the eggs small; mix them with the fowl; add salt, cayenne, and pounded mace, put in the gravy and remaining ingredients; let the whole just boil, and serve with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}12641{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12642{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.
10136-8{_}12643{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12644{_}_Note_.--Another way to make this is to mince the fowl, and warm it in white sauce or Béchamel.
10136-8{_}12645{_}When dressed like this, 3 or 4 poached eggs may be placed on the top: oysters, or chopped mushrooms, or balls of oyster forcemeat, may be laid round the dish.
10136-8{_}12646{_}THE MOULTING SEASON.--During the moulting season beginning     properly at the end of September, the fowls will require a     little extra attention.
10136-8{_}12647{_}Keep them dry and warm, and feed them     liberally on warm and satisfying food.
10136-8{_}12648{_}If in any fowl the moult     should seem protracted, examine it for broken feather-stumps     still beaded in the skin: if you find any, extract them     carefully with a pair of tweezers.
10136-8{_}12649{_}If a fowl is hearty and     strong, six weeks will see him out of his trouble; if he is     weakly, or should take cold during the time, he will not     thoroughly recover in less than three months.
10136-8{_}12650{_}It is seldom or     ever that hens will lay during the moult; while the cock, during     the same period, will give so little of his consideration to the     frivolities of love, that you may as well, nay, much better,     keep him by himself till he perfectly recovers.
10136-8{_}12651{_}A moulting     chicken makes but a sorry dish.
10136-8{_}12652{_}HASHED FOWL, Indian Fashion (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12653{_}957.--INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 3 or 4 sliced onions, 1 apple, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12654{_}of butter, pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 pint of gravy.
10136-8{_}12655{_}_Mode_.--Cut the onions into slices, mince the apple, and fry these in the butter; add pounded mace, pepper, salt, curry-powder, vinegar, flour, and sugar in the above proportions; when the onion is brown, put it the gravy, which should be previously made from the bones and trimmings of the fowls, and stew for 3/4 hour; add the fowl cut into nice-sized joints, let it warm through, and when quite tender, serve.
10136-8{_}12656{_}The dish should be garnished with au edging of boiled rice.
10136-8{_}12657{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}12658{_}Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.
10136-8{_}12659{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12660{_}THE SCOUR OR DYSENTERY.--The scour, or dysentery, or diarrhoea,     is induced variously.
10136-8{_}12661{_}A sudden alteration in diet will cause it,     as will a superabundance of green food.
10136-8{_}12662{_}The best remedy is a     piece of toasted biscuit sopped in ale.
10136-8{_}12663{_}If the disease has too     tight a hold on the bird to be quelled by this, give six drops     of syrup of white poppies and six drops of castor-oil, mixed     with a little oatmeal or ground rice.
10136-8{_}12664{_}Restrict the bird's diet,     for a few days, to dry food,--crushed beans or oats, stale     bread-crumbs, &c.      FOWL SCOLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}12665{_}958.
10136-8{_}12666{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, 1/2     pint of Béchamel, No.
10136-8{_}12667{_}367, or white sauce, No.
10136-8{_}12668{_}537 or 539.
10136-8{_}12669{_}_Mode_.--Strip off the skin from the fowl; cut the meat into     thin slices, and warm them in about 1/2 pint, or rather more, of     Béchamel, or white sauce.
10136-8{_}12670{_}When quite hot, serve, and garnish the     dish with rolled ham or bacon toasted.
10136-8{_}12671{_}_Time_.--1 minute to simmer the slices of fowl.

10136-8{_}12673{_}[Illustration: THE FEATHER LEGGED BANTAM.]
10136-8{_}12674{_}THE FEATHER LEGGED BANTAM.--Since the introduction of the Bantam     into Europe, it has ramified into many varieties, none of which     are destitute of elegance, and some, indeed, remarkable for     their beauty.
10136-8{_}12675{_}All are, or ought to be, of small size, but lively     and vigorous, exhibiting in their movements both grace and     stateliness.
10136-8{_}12676{_}The variety shown in the engraving is remarkable     for the _tarsi_, or beams of the legs, being plumed to the toes,     with stiff, long feathers, which brush the ground.
10136-8{_}12677{_}Owing,     possibly, to the little care taken to preserve this variety from     admixture, it is now not frequently seen.
10136-8{_}12678{_}Another variety is     often red, with a black breast and single dentated comb.
10136-8{_}12679{_}The     _tarsi_ are smooth, and of a dusky blue.
10136-8{_}12680{_}When this sort of     Bantam is pure, it yields in courage and spirit to none, and is,     in fact, a game-fowl in miniature, being as beautiful and     graceful as it is spirited.

10136-8{_}12684{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 3 or 4 sliced onions, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, salt to taste.
10136-8{_}12685{_}_Mode_.--Divide the fowl into joints; slice and fry the onions in a little butter, taking care not to burn them; sprinkle over the fowl a little curry-powder and salt; fry these nicely, pile them high in the centre of the dish, cover with the onion, and serve with a cut lemon on a plate.
10136-8{_}12686{_}Care must be taken that the onions are not greasy: they should be quite dry, but not burnt.
10136-8{_}12687{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to fry the onions, 10 minutes to fry the fowl.
10136-8{_}12688{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 4d.
10136-8{_}12689{_}_Seasonable_ during the winter month.
10136-8{_}12690{_}[Illustration: SPECKLED HAMBURGS.]
10136-8{_}12691{_}THE SPECKLED HAMBURG.--Of the speckled, or spangled Hamburg     which is a favourite breed with many persons, there are two     varieties,--the golden-speckled and the silver-speckled.
10136-8{_}12692{_}The     general colour of the former is golden, or orange-yellow, each     feather having a glossy dark brown or black tip, particularly     remarkable on the hackles of the cock and the wing-coverts, and     also on the darker feathers of the breast.
10136-8{_}12693{_}The female is yellow,     or orange-brown, the feathers in like manner being margined with     black.
10136-8{_}12694{_}The silver-speckled variety is distinguished by the     ground-colour of the plumage being of a silver-white, with     perhaps a tinge of straw-yellow, every leather being margined     with a semi-lunar mark of glossy black.
10136-8{_}12695{_}Both of these varieties     are extremely beautiful, the hens laying freely.
10136-8{_}12696{_}First-rate     birds command a high price.
10136-8{_}12697{_}FOWL SAUTE WITH PEAS (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12698{_}960.
10136-8{_}12699{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12700{_}of butter, pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of weak stock, 1 pint of green peas, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}12701{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into nice pieces; put the butter into a stew-pan; sautez or fry the fowl a nice brown colour, previously sprinkling it with pepper, salt, and pounded mace.
10136-8{_}12702{_}Dredge in the flour, shake the ingredients well round, then add the stock and peas, and stew till the latter are tender, which will be in about 20 minutes; put in the pounded sugar, and serve, placing the chicken round, and the peas in the middle of the dish.
10136-8{_}12703{_}When liked, mushrooms may be substituted for the peas.
10136-8{_}12704{_}_Time_.--Altogether 40 minutes.
10136-8{_}12705{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 7d.
10136-8{_}12706{_}_Seasonable_ from June to August.
10136-8{_}12707{_}BOUDIN A LA REINE (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12708{_}(M. Ude's Recipe.)
10136-8{_}12709{_}961.
10136-8{_}12710{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel No.
10136-8{_}12711{_}367, salt and cayenne to taste, egg and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}12712{_}_Mode_.--Take the breasts and nice white meat from the fowls; cut it into small dice of an equal size, and throw them into some good Béchamel, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12713{_}367; season with salt and cayenne, and put the mixture into a dish to cool.
10136-8{_}12714{_}When this preparation is quite cold, cut it into 2 equal parts, which should be made into _boudins_ of a long shape, the size of the dish they are intended to be served on; roll them in flour, egg and bread-crumb them, and be careful that the ends are well covered with the crumbs, otherwise they would break in the frying-pan; fry them a nice colour, put them before the fire to drain the greasy moisture from them, and serve with the remainder of the Béchamel poured round: this should be thinned with a little stock.
10136-8{_}12715{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the boudins.
10136-8{_}12716{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 1s.
10136-8{_}12717{_}3d.
10136-8{_}12718{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 entrée.
10136-8{_}12719{_}[Illustration: SEBRIGHT BANTAMS.]
10136-8{_}12720{_}SIR JOHN SEBRIGHT'S BANTAMS.--Above all Bantams is placed, the     celebrated and beautiful breed called Sir John Sebright's Silver     Bantams.
10136-8{_}12721{_}This breed, which Sir John brought to perfection after     years of careful trials, is very small, with un-feathered legs,     and a rose comb and short hackles.
10136-8{_}12722{_}The plumage is gold or     silver, spangled, every feather being of a golden orange, or of     a silver white, with a glossy jet-black margin; the cocks have     the tail folded like that of a hen, with the sickle feathers     shortened straight, or nearly so, and broader than usual.
10136-8{_}12723{_}The     term _hen-cocks_ is, in consequence, often applied to them; but     although the sickle feathers are thus modified, no bird     possesses higher courage, or a more gallant carriage.
10136-8{_}12724{_}The     attitude of the cock is, indeed, singularly proud; and he is     often seen to bear himself so haughtily, that his head, thrown     back as if in disdain, nearly touches the two upper     feathers--sickles they can scarcely be called--of his tail.
10136-8{_}12725{_}Half-bred birds of this kind are not uncommon, but birds of the     pure breed are not to be obtained without trouble and expense;     indeed, some time ago, it was almost impossible to procure     either a fowl or an egg.
10136-8{_}12726{_}"The finest," says the writer whom we     have consulted as to this breed, "we have ever seen, were in Sir     John's poultry-yard, adjacent to Turnham-Green Common, in the     byroad leading to Acton."
10136-8{_}12727{_}FOWL A LA MAYONNAISE.
10136-8{_}12728{_}962.
10136-8{_}12729{_}INGREDIENTS.--A cold roast fowl, Mayonnaise sauce No.
10136-8{_}12730{_}468, 4 or 5 young lettuces, 4 hard-boiled eggs, a few water-cresses, endive.
10136-8{_}12731{_}_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into neat joints, lay them in a deep dish, piling them high in the centre, sauce the fowl with Mayonnaise made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12732{_}468, and garnish the dish with young lettuces cut in halves, water-cresses, endive, and hard-boiled eggs: these may be sliced in rings, or laid on the dish whole, cutting off at the bottom a piece of the white, to make the egg stand.
10136-8{_}12733{_}All kinds of cold meat and solid fish may be dressed à la Mayonnaise, and make excellent luncheon or supper dishes.
10136-8{_}12734{_}The sauce should not be poured over the fowls until the moment of serving.
10136-8{_}12735{_}Should a very large Mayonnaise be required, use 2 fowls instead of 1, with an equal proportion of the remaining ingredients.
10136-8{_}12736{_}_Average cost_, with one fowl, 3s.
10136-8{_}12737{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12738{_}_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.
10136-8{_}12739{_}_Seasonable_ from April to September.
10136-8{_}12740{_}[Illustration: BLACK SPANISH.]
10136-8{_}12741{_}BLACK SPANISH.--The real Spanish fowl is recognized by its     uniformly black colour burnished with tints of green; its     peculiar white face, and the large development of its comb and     wattle.
10136-8{_}12742{_}The hens are excellent layers, and their eggs are of a     very large size.
10136-8{_}12743{_}They are, however, bad nurses; consequently,     their eggs should be laid in the nest of other varieties to be     hatched.
10136-8{_}12744{_}"In purchasing Spanish," says an authority, "blue legs,     the entire absence of white or coloured feathers in the plumage,     and a large, white face, with a very large high comb, which     should be erect in the cock, though pendent in the hens, should     be insisted on."
10136-8{_}12745{_}The flesh of this fowl is esteemed; but, from     the smallness of its body when compared with that of the     Dorking, it is not placed on an equality with it for the table.
10136-8{_}12746{_}Otherwise, however, they are profitable birds, and their     handsome carriage, and striking contrast of colour in the comb,     face, and plumage, are a high recommendation to them as kept     fowls.
10136-8{_}12747{_}For a town fowl, they are perhaps better adapted than any     other variety.
10136-8{_}12748{_}FOWL PILLAU, based on M. Soyer's Recipe (an Indian Dish).
10136-8{_}12749{_}963.
10136-8{_}12750{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}12751{_}of rice, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12752{_}of butter, a fowl, 2 quarts of stock or good broth, 40 cardamum-seeds, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}12753{_}of coriander-seed, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}12754{_}of cloves, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}12755{_}of allspice, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}12756{_}of mace, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}12757{_}of cinnamon, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}12758{_}of peppercorns, 4 onions, 6 thin slices of bacon, 2 hard-boiled eggs.
10136-8{_}12759{_}_Mode_.--Well wash 1 lb.
10136-8{_}12760{_}of the best Patna rice, put it into a frying-pan with the butter, which keep moving over a slow fire until the rice is lightly browned.
10136-8{_}12761{_}Truss the fowl as for boiling, put it into a stewpan with the stock or broth; pound the spices and seeds thoroughly in a mortar, tie them in a piece of muslin, and put them in with the fowl.
10136-8{_}12762{_}Let it boil slowly until it is nearly done; then add the rice, which should stew until quite tender and almost dry; cut the onions into slices, sprinkle them with flour, and fry, without breaking them, of a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}12763{_}Have ready the slices of bacon curled and grilled, and the eggs boiled hard.
10136-8{_}12764{_}Lay the fowl in the form of a pyramid upon a dish, smother with the rice, garnish with the bacon, fried onions, and the hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}12765{_}Before taking the rice out, remove the spices.
10136-8{_}12766{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to stew the fowl without the rice; 1/2 hour with it.
10136-8{_}12767{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}12768{_}3d.
10136-8{_}12769{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}12770{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12771{_}[Illustration: SULTANS.]
10136-8{_}12772{_}THE SERAI TA-OOK, OR FOWLS OF THE SULTAN.--This fowl is the size     of our English Polands, and is the latest species introduced to     England.
10136-8{_}12773{_}They have a white and flowing plumage, a full-sized,     compact Poland tuft on the head, are muffed, have a full flowing     tail, short legs well feathered, and five toes upon each foot.
10136-8{_}12774{_}Their comb consists merely of two little points, and their     wattles are very small: their colour is that of a pure white.
10136-8{_}12775{_}In     January, 1854, they arrived in this country from Constantinople;     and they take their name from _sarai_, the Turkish word for     sultan's palace, and _ta-ook_, the Turkish for fowl.
10136-8{_}12776{_}They are     thus called the "fowls of the sultan," a name which has the     twofold advantage of being the nearest to be found to that by     which they have been known in their own country, and of     designating the country whence they come.
10136-8{_}12777{_}Their habits are     described as being generally brisk and happy-tempered, but not     so easily kept in as Cochin-Chinas.
10136-8{_}12778{_}They are excellent layers;     but they are non-sitters and small eaters: their eggs are large     and white.
10136-8{_}12779{_}Brahmas or Cochins will clear the crop of a grass-run     long before they will, and, with scattered food, they soon     satisfy themselves and walk away.
10136-8{_}12780{_}POULET AUX CRESSONS.
10136-8{_}12781{_}964.
10136-8{_}12782{_}INGREDIENTS.--A fowl, a large bunch of water-cresses, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1/4 pint of gravy.
10136-8{_}12783{_}_Mode_.--Truss and roast a fowl by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12784{_}952, taking care that it is nicely frothed and brown.
10136-8{_}12785{_}Wash and dry the water-cresses, pick them nicely, and arrange them in a flat layer on a dish.
10136-8{_}12786{_}Sprinkle over a little salt and the above proportion of vinegar; place over these the fowl, and pour over it the gravy.
10136-8{_}12787{_}A little gravy should be served in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12788{_}When not liked, the vinegar may be omitted.
10136-8{_}12789{_}_Time_.--From 1/2 to 1 hour, according to size.
10136-8{_}12790{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 2s.
10136-8{_}12791{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12792{_}each.
10136-8{_}12793{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}12794{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}12795{_}ROAST FOWL, Stuffed.
10136-8{_}12796{_}965.
10136-8{_}12797{_}INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}12798{_}417, a little flour.
10136-8{_}12799{_}_Mode_.--Select a large plump fowl, fill the breast with forcemeat, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12800{_}417, truss it firmly, the same as for a plain roast fowl, dredge it with flour, and put it down to a bright fire.
10136-8{_}12801{_}Roast it for nearly or quite an hour, should it be very large; remove the skewers, and serve with a good brown gravy and a tureen of bread sauce.
10136-8{_}12802{_}_Time_.--Large fowl, nearly or quite 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12803{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 2s.
10136-8{_}12804{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12805{_}each.
10136-8{_}12806{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}12807{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.
10136-8{_}12808{_}_Note_.--Sausage-meat stuffing may be substituted for the above: this is now a very general mode of serving fowl.
10136-8{_}12809{_}[Illustration: PENCILLED HAMBURG.]
10136-8{_}12810{_}PENCILLED HAMBURG.--This variety of the Hamburg fowl is of two     colours, golden and silver, and is very minutely marked.
10136-8{_}12811{_}The     hens of both should have the body clearly pencilled across with     several bars of black, and the hackle in both, sexes should be     perfectly free from dark marks.
10136-8{_}12812{_}The cocks do not exhibit the     pencillings, but are white or brown in the golden or silver     birds respectively.
10136-8{_}12813{_}Their form is compact, and their attitudes     graceful and sprightly.
10136-8{_}12814{_}The hens do not sit, but lay extremely     well; hence one of their common names, that of Dutch every-day     layers.
10136-8{_}12815{_}They are also known in different parts of the country,     as Chitteprats, Creoles, or Corals, Bolton bays and grays, and,     in some parts of Yorkshire, by the wrong name of Corsican fowls.
10136-8{_}12816{_}They are imported in large numbers from Holland, but those bred     in this country are greatly superior in size.
10136-8{_}12817{_}GIBLET PIE.
10136-8{_}12818{_}966.
10136-8{_}12819{_}INGREDIENTS.--A set of duck or goose giblets, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}12820{_}of rump-steak, 1 onion, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, a bunch of savoury herbs, plain crust.
10136-8{_}12821{_}_Mode_.--Clean, and put the giblets into a stewpan with an onion, whole pepper, and a bunch of savoury herbs; add rather more than a pint of water, and simmer gently for about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12822{_}Take them out, let them cool, and cut them into pieces; line the bottom of a pie-dish with a few pieces of rump-steak; add a layer of giblets and a few more pieces of steak; season with pepper and salt, and pour in the gravy (which should be strained), that the giblets were stewed in; cover with a plain crust, and bake for rather more than 1-1/2 hour in a brisk oven.
10136-8{_}12823{_}Cover a piece of paper over the pie, to prevent the crust taking too much colour.
10136-8{_}12824{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to stew the giblets, about 1 hour to bake the pie.
10136-8{_}12825{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the giblets, 1s.
10136-8{_}12826{_}4d.
10136-8{_}12827{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}12828{_}THE BRENT GOOSE.--This is the smallest and most numerous species     of the geese which visit the British islands.
10136-8{_}12829{_}It makes its     appearance in winter, and ranges over the whole of the coasts     and estuaries frequented by other migrant geese.
10136-8{_}12830{_}Mr. Selby     states that a very large body of these birds annually resort to     the extensive sandy and muddy flats which lie between the     mainland and Holy Island, on the Northumbrian coast, and which     are covered by every flow of the tide.
10136-8{_}12831{_}This part of the coast     appears to have been a favourite resort of these birds from time     immemorial, where they have always received the name of Ware     geese, no doubt from their continually feeding on marine     vegetables.
10136-8{_}12832{_}Their flesh is very agreeable.
10136-8{_}12833{_}HASHED GOOSE.
10136-8{_}12834{_}967.
10136-8{_}12835{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast goose, 2 onions, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}12836{_}of butter, 1 pint of boiling water, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}12837{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the goose into pieces of the size required; the inferior joints, trimmings, &c., put into a stewpan to make the gravy; slice and fry the onions in the butter of a very pale brown; add these to the trimmings, and pour over about a pint of boiling water; stew these gently for 3/4 hour, then skim and strain the liquor.
10136-8{_}12838{_}Thicken it with flour, and flavour with port wine and ketchup, in the above proportion; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and put in the pieces of goose; let these get thoroughly hot through, but do not allow them to boil, and serve with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}12839{_}_Time_.--Altogether, rather more than 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12840{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold goose, 4d.
10136-8{_}12841{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March.
10136-8{_}12842{_}THE WILD GOOSE.--This bird is sometimes called the "Gray-lag"     and is the original of the domestic goose.
10136-8{_}12843{_}It is, according to     Pennant, the only species which the Britons could take young,     and familiarize.
10136-8{_}12844{_}"The Gray-lag," says Mr. Gould, "is known to     Persia, and we believe it is generally dispersed over Asia     Minor."
10136-8{_}12845{_}It is the bird that saved the Capitol by its vigilance,     and by the Romans was cherished accordingly.
10136-8{_}12846{_}ROAST GOOSE.
10136-8{_}12847{_}968.
10136-8{_}12848{_}INGREDIENTS.--Goose, 4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}12849{_}of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}12850{_}of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.
10136-8{_}12851{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Select a goose with a clean white skin, plump breast, and yellow feet: if these latter are red, the bird is old.
10136-8{_}12852{_}Should the weather permit, let it hang for a few days: by so doing, the flavour will be very much improved.
10136-8{_}12853{_}Pluck, singe, draw, and carefully wash and wipe the goose; cut off the neck close to the back, leaving the skin long enough to turn over; cut off the feet at the first joint, and separate the pinions at the first joint.
10136-8{_}12854{_}Beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin, put a skewer through the under part of each wing, and having drawn up the legs closely, put a skewer into the middle of each, and pass the same quite through the body.
10136-8{_}12855{_}Insert another skewer into the small of the leg, bring it close down to the side bone, run it through, and do the same to the other side.
10136-8{_}12856{_}Now cut off the end of the vent, and make a hole in the skin sufficiently large for the passage of the rump, in order to keep in the seasoning.
10136-8{_}12857{_}[Illustration: ROAST GOOSE.]
10136-8{_}12858{_}_Mode_.--Make a sage-and-onion stuffing of the above ingredients, by recipe No.
10136-8{_}12859{_}504; put it into the body of the goose, and secure it firmly at both ends, by passing the rump through the hole made in the skin, and the other end by tying the skin of the neck to the back; by this means the seasoning will not escape.
10136-8{_}12860{_}Put it down to a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and roast from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according to the size.
10136-8{_}12861{_}Remove the skewers, and serve with a tureen of good gravy, and one of well-made apple-sauce.
10136-8{_}12862{_}Should a very highly-flavoured seasoning be preferred, the onions should not be parboiled, but minced raw: of the two methods, the mild seasoning is far superior.
10136-8{_}12863{_}A ragoût, or pie, should be made of the giblets, or they may be stewed down to make gravy.
10136-8{_}12864{_}Be careful to serve the goose before the breast falls, or its appearance will be spoiled by coming flattened to table.
10136-8{_}12865{_}As this is rather a troublesome joint to carve, a _large_ quantity of gravy should not be poured round the goose, but sent in a tureen.
10136-8{_}12866{_}_Time_.--A large goose, 1-3/4 hour; a moderate-sized one, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12867{_}_Seasonable_ from September to March; but in perfection from Michaelmas to Christmas.

10136-8{_}12870{_}each.
10136-8{_}12871{_}_Sufficient_ for 8 or 9 persons.
10136-8{_}12872{_}_Note_.--A teaspoonful of made mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne, mixed with a glass of port wine, are sometimes poured into the goose by a slit made in the apron.
10136-8{_}12873{_}This sauce is, by many persons, considered an improvement.
10136-8{_}12874{_}[Illustration: EMDEN GOOSE.]
10136-8{_}12875{_}THE GOOSE.--This bird is pretty generally distributed over the     face of the globe, being met with in North America, Lapland,     Iceland, Arabia, and Persia.
10136-8{_}12876{_}Its varieties are numerous; but in     England there is only one species, which is supposed to be a     native breed.
10136-8{_}12877{_}The best geese are found on the borders of     Suffolk, and in Norfolk and Berkshire; but the largest flocks     are reared in the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridge.
10136-8{_}12878{_}They     thrive best where they have an easy access to water, and large     herds of them are sent every year to London, to be fattened by     the metropolitan poulterers.
10136-8{_}12879{_}"A Michaelmas goose," says Dr.     Kitchener, "is as famous in the mouths of the million as the     minced-pie at Christmas; yet for those who eat with delicacy, it     is, at that time, too full-grown.
10136-8{_}12880{_}The true period when the goose     is in the highest perfection is when it has just acquired its     full growth, and not begun to harden; if the March goose is     insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank.
10136-8{_}12881{_}The fine time is between     both; from the second week in June to the first in September."
10136-8{_}12882{_}It is said that the Michaelmas goose is indebted to Queen     Elizabeth for its origin on the table at that season.
10136-8{_}12883{_}Her     majesty happened to dine on one at the table of an English     baronet, when she received the news of the discomfiture of the     Spanish Armada.
10136-8{_}12884{_}In commemoration of this event, she commanded     the goose to make its appearance at table on every Michaelmas.
10136-8{_}12885{_}We here give an engraving of the Emden goose.
10136-8{_}12886{_}TO DRESS A GREEN GOOSE.
10136-8{_}12887{_}969.
10136-8{_}12888{_}INGREDIENTS.--Goose, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}12889{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}12890{_}_Mode_.--Geese are called green till they are about four months old, and should not be stuffed.
10136-8{_}12891{_}After it has been singed and trussed, the same as in the preceding recipe, put into the body a seasoning of pepper and salt, and the butter to moisten it inside.
10136-8{_}12892{_}Roast before a clear fire for about 3/4 hour, froth and brown it nicely, and serve with a brown gravy, and, when liked, gooseberry-sauce.
10136-8{_}12893{_}This dish should be garnished with water-cresses.
10136-8{_}12894{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour.

10136-8{_}12900{_}[Illustration: TOULOUSE GOOSE.]
10136-8{_}12901{_}THE EGYPTIAN GOOSE.--Especial attention has been directed to     this bird by Herodotus, who says it was held sacred by the     ancient Egyptians, which has been partially confirmed by modern     travellers.
10136-8{_}12902{_}Mr. Salt remarks, "Horus Apollo says the old geese     stay with their young in the most imminent danger, at the risk     of their own lives, which I have myself frequently witnessed.
10136-8{_}12903{_}Vielpanser is the goose of the Nile, and wherever this goose is     represented on the walls of the temples in colours, the     resemblance may be clearly traced."
10136-8{_}12904{_}The goose is also said to     have been a bird under the care of Isis.
10136-8{_}12905{_}It has been placed by     Mr. Gould amongst the birds of Europe; not from the number of     half-reclaimed individuals which are annually shot in Britain,     but from the circumstance of its occasionally visiting the     southern parts of the continent from its native country, Africa.
10136-8{_}12906{_}The Toulouse goose, of which we give an engraving, is a     well-known bird.
10136-8{_}12907{_}ROAST GUINEA-FOWL, Larded.
10136-8{_}12908{_}970.
10136-8{_}12909{_}INGREDIENTS.--A Guinea-fowl, lardoons, flour, and salt.
10136-8{_}12910{_}_Mode_.--When this bird is larded, it should be trussed the same as a pheasant; if plainly roasted, truss it like a turkey.
10136-8{_}12911{_}After larding and trussing it, put it down to roast at a brisk fire; keep it well basted, and a short time before serving, dredge it with a little flour, and let it froth nicely.
10136-8{_}12912{_}Serve with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same, and one of well-made bread-sauce.
10136-8{_}12913{_}_Time_.--Guinea-fowl, larded, 1-1/4 hour; plainly roasted, about 1 hour.
10136-8{_}12914{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}12915{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}12916{_}_Note_.--The breast, if larded, should be covered with a piece of paper, and removed about 10 minutes before serving.
10136-8{_}12917{_}[Illustration: GUINEA-FOWLS.]
10136-8{_}12918{_}THE GUINEA-FOWL.--The bird takes its name from Guinea, in     Africa, where it is found--wild, and in great abundance.
10136-8{_}12919{_}It is     gregarious in its habits, associating in flocks of two or three     hundred, delighting in marshy grounds, and at night perching     upon trees, or on high situations.
10136-8{_}12920{_}Its size is about the same as     that of a common hen, but it stands higher on its legs.
10136-8{_}12921{_}Though     domesticated, it retains much of its wild nature, and is apt to     wander.
10136-8{_}12922{_}The hens lay abundantly, and the eggs are excellent.
10136-8{_}12923{_}In     their flesh, however, they are not so white as the common fowl,     but more inclined to the colour of the pheasant, for which it     frequently makes a good substitute at table.
10136-8{_}12924{_}The flesh is both     savoury and easy of digestion, and is in season when game is out     of season.
10136-8{_}12925{_}LARK PIE (an Entree).
10136-8{_}12926{_}971.
10136-8{_}12927{_}INGREDIENTS.--A few thin slices of beef, the same of bacon, 9 larks, flour; for stuffing, 1 teacupful of bread crumbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 egg, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of chopped shalot, 1/2 pint of weak stock or water, puff-paste.
10136-8{_}12928{_}_Mode_.--Make a stuffing of bread crumbs, minced lemon-peel, parsley, and the yolk of an egg, all of which should be well mixed together; roll the larks in flour, and stuff them.
10136-8{_}12929{_}Line the bottom of a pie-dish with a few slices of beef and bacon; over these place the larks, and season with salt, pepper, minced parsley, and chopped shalot, in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}12930{_}Pour in the stock or water, cover with crust, and bake for an hour in a moderate oven.
10136-8{_}12931{_}During the time the pie is baking, shake it 2 or 3 times, to assist in thickening the gravy, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}12932{_}_Time_.--1 hour.

10136-8{_}12934{_}6d.
10136-8{_}12935{_}a dozen.
10136-8{_}12936{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.

10136-8{_}12938{_}ROAST LARKS.
10136-8{_}12939{_}972.
10136-8{_}12940{_}INGREDIENTS.--Larks, egg and bread crumbs, fresh butter.
10136-8{_}12941{_}_Mode_.--These birds are by many persons esteemed a great delicacy, and may be either roasted or broiled.
10136-8{_}12942{_}Pick, gut, and clean them; when they are trussed, brush them over with the yolk of an egg; sprinkle with bread crumbs, and roast them before a quick fire; baste them continually with fresh butter, and keep sprinkling with the bread crumbs until the birds are well covered.
10136-8{_}12943{_}Dish them on bread crumbs fried in clarified butter, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
10136-8{_}12944{_}Broiled larks are also very excellent: they should be cooked over a clear fire, and would take about 10 minutes or 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}12945{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to roast; 10 minutes to broil.
10136-8{_}12946{_}_Seasonable_.--In full season in November.
10136-8{_}12947{_}_Note_.--Larks may also be plainly roasted, without covering them with egg and bread crumbs; they should be dished on fried crumbs.
10136-8{_}12948{_}BROILED PIGEONS.
10136-8{_}12949{_}973.
10136-8{_}12950{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pigeons, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}12951{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}12952{_}_Mode_.--Take care that the pigeons are quite fresh, and carefully pluck, draw, and wash them; split the backs, rub the birds over with butter, season them with pepper and salt, and broil them over a moderate fire for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}12953{_}Serve very hot, with either mushroom-sauce or a good gravy.
10136-8{_}12954{_}Pigeons may also be plainly boiled, and served with parsley and butter; they should be trussed like boiled fowls, and take from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes to boil.
10136-8{_}12955{_}_Time_.--To broil a pigeon, from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes; to boil one, the same time.
10136-8{_}12956{_}_Average cost_, from 6d.
10136-8{_}12957{_}to 9d.
10136-8{_}12958{_}each.
10136-8{_}12959{_}_Seasonable_ from April to September, but in the greatest perfection from midsummer to Michaelmas.
10136-8{_}12960{_}THE POUTER PIGEON.--This is a very favourite pigeon, and,     without doubt, the most curious of his species.
10136-8{_}12961{_}He is a tail     strong bird, as he had need be to carry about his great inflated     crop, frequently as large and as round as a middling-sized     turnip.
10136-8{_}12962{_}A perfect pouter, seen on a windy day, is certainly a     ludicrous sight: his feathered legs have the appearance of white     trousers; his tapering tail looks like a swallow-tailed coat;     his head is entirely concealed by his immense windy     protuberance; and, altogether, he reminds you of a little     "swell" of a past century, staggering under a bale of linen.
10136-8{_}12963{_}The     most common pouters are the blues, buffs, and whites, or an     intermixture of all these various colours.
10136-8{_}12964{_}The pouter is not a     prolific breeder, is a bad nurse, and more likely to degenerate,     if not repeatedly crossed and re-crossed with Irish stock, than     any other pigeon: nevertheless, it is a useful bird to keep if     you are founding a new colony, as it is much attached to its     home, and little apt to stray; consequently it is calculated to     induce more restless birds to fettle down and make themselves     comfortable.
10136-8{_}12965{_}If you wish to breed pouters, you cannot do worse     than intrust them with the care of their own eggs.
10136-8{_}12966{_}ROAST PIGEONS.
10136-8{_}12967{_}974.
10136-8{_}12968{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pigeons, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}12969{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}12970{_}_Trussing_.--Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh (if kept a little, the flavour goes off), and they should be drawn as soon as killed.
10136-8{_}12971{_}Cut off the heads and necks, truss the wings over the backs, and cut off the toes at the first joint: previous to trussing, they should be carefully cleaned, as no bird requires so much washing.
10136-8{_}12972{_}[Illustration: ROAST PIGEON.]
10136-8{_}12973{_}_Mode_.--Wipe the birds very dry, season them inside with pepper and salt, and put about 3/4 oz.
10136-8{_}12974{_}of butter into the body of each: this makes them moist.
10136-8{_}12975{_}Put them down to a bright fire, and baste them well the whole of the time they are cooking (they will be done enough in from 20 to 30 minutes); garnish with fried parsley, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter.
10136-8{_}12976{_}Bread-sauce and gravy, the same as for roast fowl, are exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast pigeons, as also egg-sauce.
10136-8{_}12977{_}_Time_.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}12978{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}12979{_}to 9d.
10136-8{_}12980{_}each.
10136-8{_}12981{_}_Seasonable_ from April to September; but in the greatest perfection from Midsummer to Michaelmas.
10136-8{_}12982{_}THE PIGEON--The pigeon tribe forms a connecting ling between the     passerine birds and poultry.
10136-8{_}12983{_}They are widely distributed over     the world, some of the species being found even in the arctic     regions.
10136-8{_}12984{_}Their chief food is grain, and they drink much; not at     intervals, like other birds, but by a continuous draught, like     quadrupeds.
10136-8{_}12985{_}The wild pigeon, or stockdove, is the parent whence     all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived.
10136-8{_}12986{_}In the     wild state it is still found in many parts of this island,     making its nest in the holes of rocks, in the hollows of trees,     or in old towers, but never, like the ringdove, on branches.
10136-8{_}12987{_}The     blue house-pigeon is the variety principally reared for the     table in this country, and is produced from our farmyards in     great numbers.
10136-8{_}12988{_}When young, and still fed by their parents, they     are most preferable for the table, and are called _squabs_;     under six months they are denominated _squeakers_, and at six     months they begin to breed.
10136-8{_}12989{_}Their flesh is accounted savoury,     delicate, and stimulating, and the dark-coloured birds are     considered to have the highest flavour, whilst the light are     esteemed to have the more delicate flesh.
10136-8{_}12990{_}THE PIGEON-HOUSE, OR DOVECOT.--The first thing to be done     towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for     their reception; and the next is, to provide the pigeons     themselves.
10136-8{_}12991{_}The situation or size of the dovecot will     necessarily depend on convenience; but there is one point which     must invariably be observed, and that is, that every pair of     pigeons has two holes or rooms to nest in.
10136-8{_}12992{_}This is     indispensable, as, without it, there will be no security, but     the constant prospect of confusion, breaking of eggs, and the     destruction of young.
10136-8{_}12993{_}The proper place for the pigeon-house is     the poultry-yard; but it does very well near dwellings, stables,     brewhouses, bakehouses, or such offices.
10136-8{_}12994{_}Some persons keep     pigeons in rooms, and have them making their nests on the floor.
10136-8{_}12995{_}The object is to escape the danger of the young falling out; but     in such cases, there is a great risk of rats or other vermin     getting at the pigeons.
10136-8{_}12996{_}ASPECT OF THE PIGEON-HOUSE.--The front of the pigeon-house     should have a southwest aspect, and, if a room be selected for     the purpose, it is usual to break a hole in the roof of the     building for the passage of the pigeons, but which can be closed     at convenience.
10136-8{_}12997{_}A platform ought to be laid at the entrance for     the pigeons to perch upon, with some kind of defence against     strange cats, which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot.
10136-8{_}12998{_}Yet, although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds, they     are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice,     which will not only suck the eggs, but destroy the birds.
10136-8{_}12999{_}The     platform should be painted white, and renewed as the paint wears     off, white being a favourite colour with pigeons, and also most     conspicuous as a mark to enable them to find their house.
10136-8{_}13000{_}The     boxes ought also to be similarly painted, and renewed when     necessary, for which purpose lime and water will do very well.
10136-8{_}13001{_}THE NECESSITY OF CLEANLINESS.--As cleanliness in human     habitations is of the first importance, so is it in the     pigeon-house.
10136-8{_}13002{_}There the want of it will soon render the place a     nuisance not to be approached, and the birds, both young and     old, will be so covered with vermin and filth, that they will     neither enjoy health nor comforts, whilst early mortality     amongst them will be almost certain.
10136-8{_}13003{_}In some cases, the     pigeon-house is cleaned daily; but it should always be done, at     any rate, once a week, and the floor covered with sifted gravel,     frequently renewed.
10136-8{_}13004{_}Pigeons being exceedingly fond of water, and     having a prescience of the coming of rain, they may be seen upon     the house-tops waiting upon it until late in the evening, and     then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the     refreshing shower.
10136-8{_}13005{_}When they are confined in a room, therefore,     they should be allowed a wide pan of water, to be often renewed.
10136-8{_}13006{_}This serves them for a bath, which cools, refreshes, and assists     them to keep their bodies clear of vermin.
10136-8{_}13007{_}BREEDING PIGEONS.--In breeding pigeons, it is necessary to match     a cock and hen, and shut them up together, or place them near to     each other, and in the course of a day or two there is little     doubt of their mating.
10136-8{_}13008{_}Various rules have been laid down for the     purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen     pigeon; but the masculine forwardness and action of the cock is     generally so remarkable, that he is easily ascertained.
10136-8{_}13009{_}The     pigeon being monogamous, the male attaches and confines himself     to one female, and the attachment is reciprocal, and the     fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial.
10136-8{_}13010{_}At the age of     six months, young pigeons are termed squeakers, and then begin     to breed, when properly managed.
10136-8{_}13011{_}Their courtship, and the     well-known tone of voice in the cock, just then acquired and     commencing, are indications of their approaching union.
10136-8{_}13012{_}Nestlings, while fed by cock and hen, are termed squabs, and     are, at that age, sold and used for the table.
10136-8{_}13013{_}The dove-house     pigeon is said to breed monthly, when well supplied with food.
10136-8{_}13014{_}At all events, it may be depended on, that pigeons of almost any     healthy and well-established variety will breed eight or nine     times in the year; whence it may readily be conceived how vast     are the numbers that may be raised.
10136-8{_}13015{_}[Illustration: CARRIER PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13016{_}THE CARRIER PIGEON.--Without doubt the carrier is entitled to     rank first in the pigeon family, with the exception, perhaps, of     the blue-rock pigeons.
10136-8{_}13017{_}No domestic fowl can be traced to so     remote an antiquity.
10136-8{_}13018{_}When Greece was in its glory, carrier     pigeons were used to convey to distant parts the names of the     victors at the Olympian games.
10136-8{_}13019{_}During the holy war, when Acre     was besieged by King Richard, Saladin habitually corresponded     with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons.
10136-8{_}13020{_}A shaft from an     English crossbow, however, happened to bring one of those     feathered messengers to the ground, and the stratagem was     discovered, the design of the Saracens revealed, and so turned     against the designers, that Acre was in the hands of the     Christians before the wily Saladin dreamt of such a thing.

10136-8{_}13022{_}975.
10136-8{_}13023{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}13024{_}of rump-steak, 2 or 3 pigeons, 3 slices of ham, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}13025{_}of butter, 4 eggs, puff crust.
10136-8{_}13026{_}_Mode_.--Cut the steak into pieces about 3 inches square, and with it line the bottom of a pie-dish, seasoning it well with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}13027{_}Clean the pigeons, rub them with pepper and salt inside and out, and put into the body of each rather more than 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}13028{_}of butter; lay them on the steak, and a piece of ham on each pigeon.
10136-8{_}13029{_}Add the yolks of 4 eggs, and half fill the dish with stock; place a border of puff paste round the edge of the dish, put on the cover, and ornament it in any way that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}13030{_}Clean three of the feet, and place them in a hole made in the crust at the top: this shows what kind of pie it is.
10136-8{_}13031{_}Glaze the crust,--that is to say, brush it over with the yolk of an egg,--and bake it in a well-heated oven for about 1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}13032{_}When liked, a seasoning of pounded mace may be added.
10136-8{_}13033{_}_Time_.--1-1/4 hour, or rather less.

10136-8{_}13039{_}TUMBLER PIGEONS.--The smaller the size of this variety, the     greater its value.
10136-8{_}13040{_}The head should be round and smooth, the neck     thin, and the tail similar to that of the turbit.
10136-8{_}13041{_}Highly-bred     birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight     beyond that of any other pigeons; and it is in seeing these     little birds wing themselves so far into the skies that the     fanciers take such delight.
10136-8{_}13042{_}For four or five hours tumblers have     been known to keep on the wing; and it is when they are almost     lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those     pantomimic feats which give them their name, and which are     marked by a tumbling over-and-over process, which suggests the     idea of their having suddenly become giddy, been deprived of     their self-control, or overtaken by some calamity.
10136-8{_}13043{_}This     acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some     to the absence of a proper power in the tail; but is nothing     more than a natural habit, for which no adequate reason can be     assigned.
10136-8{_}13044{_}Of this variety, the Almond Tumbler is the most     beautiful; and the greater the variation of the colour in the     flight and tail, the greater their value.
10136-8{_}13045{_}[Illustration: RUNT PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13046{_}THE RUNT PIGEON.--This is generally esteemed among the largest     of the pigeon varieties, and being possessed of proportionate     strength, with a strong propensity to exercise it, they keep the     dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering     over the weaker inmates.
10136-8{_}13047{_}They breed tolerably well, however, and     are valuable for the table.
10136-8{_}13048{_}There is both the Leghorn and the     Spanish Runt, variously plumaged; but when red, white, or black     mottled, are most highly esteemed.
10136-8{_}13049{_}One of the great advantages     connected with the Runt is, that he is not likely to fly away     from home.
10136-8{_}13050{_}Being heavy birds, they find it difficult, when well     fed, to mount even to a low housetop.
10136-8{_}13051{_}Again, they require no     loft, or special dwelling-place, but, if properly tended, will     be perfectly satisfied, and thrive as well, in a rabbit-hutch as     any where.
10136-8{_}13052{_}Their flavour is very good; and it is not an uncommon     thing for a squeaker Runt to exceed a pound and a quarter in     weight.
10136-8{_}13053{_}[Illustration: NUN PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13054{_}THE NUN PIGEON.--The Tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this     variety, which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising     from the back of the head, and which, on the whole, is an     extremely pretty little bird.
10136-8{_}13055{_}According to the colour of the     head, it is called the red, black, or yellow-headed Nun.
10136-8{_}13056{_}To be a     perfect bird, it should have a small head and beak; and the     larger the tuft at the back of his head, the handsomer the bird     is esteemed, and proportionately valuable in the eyes of     pigeon-fanciers.
10136-8{_}13057{_}[Illustration: TRUMPETER PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13058{_}THE TRUMPETER PIGEON.--From the circumstance of this bird     imitating the sound of a trumpet, instead of cooing, like other     pigeons, it has received its designation.
10136-8{_}13059{_}It is of the middle     size, having its legs and feet covered with feathers, and its     plumage generally of a mottled black-and-white.
10136-8{_}13060{_}It has a tuft     springing from the root of its beak, and the larger this topknot     is, the higher the estimation in which the breed is held.
10136-8{_}13061{_}In     their powers of trumpeting some are more expert than others; and     whether this has any effect in influencing their own estimate of     themselves, we cannot say; but they are rather select in the     choice of their company.
10136-8{_}13062{_}If two of them are put in a     pigeon-house with other doves, it will be found that they     confine their association almost entirely to each other.
10136-8{_}13063{_}As much     as two guineas have been paid for a well-trained docile bird of     this kind.
10136-8{_}13064{_}[Illustration: WOOD-PIGEON.]
10136-8{_}13065{_}THE WOOD, OR WILD PIGEON.--Buffon enumerates upwards of thirty     varieties of the pigeon, which he derives from one root,--viz.
10136-8{_}13066{_}the stockdove, or common wild pigeon.
10136-8{_}13067{_}All the varieties of     colour and form which we witness, he attributes to human     contrivance and fancy.
10136-8{_}13068{_}Nevertheless, there exist essentially     specific differences in these birds, which would appear to be     attributable rather to the nature of the region, soil, and     climate to which they are indigenous, than to the art and     ingenuity of man.
10136-8{_}13069{_}The stockdove, in its wild state, is still     found in some parts of Britain, forming its nest in the holes of     rocks, old towers, and in the hollows of trees; it never,     however, like the ringdove, nestles in the branches.
10136-8{_}13070{_}Multitudes     of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter, coming     from their more northerly retreats, making their appearance     about November, and retiring again in the spring.
10136-8{_}13071{_}When forests     of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country,     these birds used to haunt them in myriads, frequently covering a     mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to     feed.
10136-8{_}13072{_}STEWED PIGEONS.
10136-8{_}13073{_}976.
10136-8{_}13074{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 pigeons, a few slices of bacon, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}13075{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, sufficient stock No.
10136-8{_}13076{_}104 to cover the pigeons, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine.
10136-8{_}13077{_}_Mode_.--Empty and clean the pigeons thoroughly, mince the livers, add to these the parsley and butter, and put it into the insides of the birds.
10136-8{_}13078{_}Truss them with the legs inward, and put them into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon placed under and over them; add the stock, and stew gently for rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}13079{_}Dish the pigeons, strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and port wine, give one boil, pour over the pigeons, and serve.
10136-8{_}13080{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}13081{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}13082{_}to 9d.
10136-8{_}13083{_}each.
10136-8{_}13084{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}13085{_}_Seasonable_ from April to September.
10136-8{_}13086{_}[Illustration: FANTAIL PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13087{_}THE FANTAIL PIGEON.--This curious variety is inferior in point     of size to most of the other varieties, and is characterized by     having a short, slender bill, pendent wings, and naked legs and     feet.
10136-8{_}13088{_}It has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a     turkey-cock; during which action, especially when paying court     to it's mate, it trembles or shakes, like the peacock when     moving about with his train expanded and in full display.
10136-8{_}13089{_}This     power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the     male bird alone: the female possesses the same power to an equal     extent, and otherwise resembles the male in every respect.
10136-8{_}13090{_}It is     not very prolific, and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or     pigeon-house as most of the other kinds.
10136-8{_}13091{_}[Illustration: JACOBIN PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13092{_}THE JACOBIN PIGEON.--This variety, having the power to transmit     to posterity a form precisely similar, with all its peculiar     characters undiminished, is, among pigeon-fanciers, designated     as of a pure or permanent race.
10136-8{_}13093{_}It is distinguished by a     remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers, which, commencing     behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast, forms a     kind of hood, not unlike that worn by a monk.
10136-8{_}13094{_}From this     circumstance, it has obtained its Gallic name of _nonnain     capuchin_.
10136-8{_}13095{_}In size it is one of the smallest of the domestic     pigeons, and its form is light and elegant.
10136-8{_}13096{_}It is a very     productive species, and, having its flight considerably impeded     by the size and form of its hooded frill, keeps much at home,     and is well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where     pigeons are confined.
10136-8{_}13097{_}[Illustration: TURBIT PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13098{_}THE TURBIT PIGEON.--This variety bears a strong resemblance to     the Jacobin, having a kind of frill in the fore part of its     neck, occasioned by the breast-feathers lying contrariwise and     standing straight out.
10136-8{_}13099{_}The species is classed in accordance with     the colour of the shoulders, similarly as the Nuns are by the     colour of their heads.
10136-8{_}13100{_}Their characteristics of excellence are a     full frill, short bill, and small round head.
10136-8{_}13101{_}In Germany it is     called the ruffle pigeon, in allusion to the feathers on its     breast; and it has rarely any feathers on its feet.
10136-8{_}13102{_}There is a     peculiarity connected with this bird, which somewhat lowers it     in the estimation of fanciers: it seldom rears more than one at     a time, which, therefore, marks it as a bird rather for     amusement than profit.
10136-8{_}13103{_}[Illustration: BARB PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13104{_}THE BARB PIGEON.--The name of this variety is a contraction of     Barbary, from which country it originally comes.
10136-8{_}13105{_}It is both     prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse.
10136-8{_}13106{_}The kind most     esteemed is that of one uniform colour, that of blue-black being     preferable to any other.
10136-8{_}13107{_}Speckled or mottled Barbs are esteemed     the most common of all pigeons.
10136-8{_}13108{_}It is not unlike the Carrier     pigeon, and, at a small distance, might easily be mistaken for     the latter.
10136-8{_}13109{_}It has a short beak and a small wattle.
10136-8{_}13110{_}A spongy,     pinky skin round the eyes is its chief characteristic, however,     and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years     old.
10136-8{_}13111{_}This peculiarity is hardly distinguishable in very young     birds.
10136-8{_}13112{_}[Illustration: BLUE ROCK-PIGEON.]
10136-8{_}13113{_}THE ROCK PIGEON.--This variety, in its wild state, is found upon     the rocky parts of the west of Scotland, and the bold shores of     the Western Isles, more abundant than in any other parts of the     British islands.
10136-8{_}13114{_}As the shores of the mainland are exposed to     the muds of the Atlantic, and the comparatively small islands     are surrounded by that ocean, the low grounds exposed to the     west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time, and     thus the birds easily find a supply of food.
10136-8{_}13115{_}The numbers which     there congregate are often very great, and the din of their     united cry is sometimes very loud and even alarming.
10136-8{_}13116{_}The love of     home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in     the rock-pigeon or _biset_, as it is called by the French.
10136-8{_}13117{_}Flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the     feeding-grounds; but when the time of returning to rest comes     round, each one keeps to its own party.
10136-8{_}13118{_}[Illustration: OWL PIGEONS.]
10136-8{_}13119{_}THE OWL PIGEON.--This pigeon does not seem to be so well known     as it formerly was, if we may judge from the fact that few     modern writers mention it.
10136-8{_}13120{_}Like the Turbit pigeon, the Owl has a     remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast, it having been     compared by some to the frill of a shirt, and by others to a     full-blown white rose.
10136-8{_}13121{_}In size, it is not quite so large a     pigeon as the Jacobin.
10136-8{_}13122{_}It is said to be preferred in France,     above other varieties, as a bird to rear and kill for the table.
10136-8{_}13123{_}In England it is very far from being common; indeed, we have     applied to several keepers of pigeons, who have fancied     themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird, and     they have been able to tell us nothing of it.
10136-8{_}13124{_}Mr. Harrison Weir,     our artist, however, has made his portrait from the life.
10136-8{_}13125{_}BOILED RABBIT.
10136-8{_}13126{_}[Illustration: BOILED RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13127{_}977.
10136-8{_}13128{_}INGREDIENTS.--Rabbit; water.
10136-8{_}13129{_}_Mode_.--For boiling, choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws, as that denotes they are young: should these be blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, the animal is old.
10136-8{_}13130{_}After emptying and skinning it, wash it well in cold water, and let it soak for about 1/4 hour in warm water, to draw out the blood.
10136-8{_}13131{_}Bring the head round to the side, and fasten it there by means of a skewer run through that and the body.
10136-8{_}13132{_}Put the rabbit into sufficient hot water to cover it, let it boil very gently until tender, which will be in from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to its size and age.
10136-8{_}13133{_}Dish it, and smother it either with onion, mushroom, or liver sauce, or parsley-and-butter; the former is, however, generally preferred to any of the last-named sauces.
10136-8{_}13134{_}When liver-sauce is preferred, the liver should be boiled for a few minutes, and minced very finely, or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce.
10136-8{_}13135{_}_Time_.--A very young rabbit, 1/2 hour; a large one, 3/4 hour; an old one, 1 hour or longer.
10136-8{_}13136{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}13137{_}to 1s.

10136-8{_}13140{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}13141{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}13142{_}THE RABBIT.--Though this animal is an inhabitant of most     temperate climates, it does not reach so far north as the hare.
10136-8{_}13143{_}The wild rabbit is a native of Great Britain, and is found in     large numbers in the sandy districts of Norfolk and     Cambridgeshire.
10136-8{_}13144{_}Its flesh is, by some, considered to have a     higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit, although it is     neither so white nor so delicate.
10136-8{_}13145{_}The animal, however, becomes     larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state; but it is     not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made.
10136-8{_}13146{_}CURRIED RABBIT.
10136-8{_}13147{_}978.
10136-8{_}13148{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}13149{_}of butter, 3 onions, 1 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}13150{_}104, 1 tablespoonful of curry powder, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of mushroom powder, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}13151{_}of rice.
10136-8{_}13152{_}_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it neatly into joints.
10136-8{_}13153{_}Put it into a stewpan with the butter and sliced onions, and let them acquire a nice brown colour, but do not allow them to blacken.
10136-8{_}13154{_}Pour in the stock, which should be boiling; mix the curry powder and flour smoothly with a little water, add it to the stock, with the mushroom powder, and simmer gently for rather more than 1/2 hour; squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve in the centre of a dish, with an edging of boiled rice all round.
10136-8{_}13155{_}Where economy is studied, water may be substituted for the stock; in this case, the meat and onions must be very nicely browned.
10136-8{_}13156{_}A little sour apple and rasped cocoa-nut stewed with the curry will be found a great improvement.
10136-8{_}13157{_}_Time_.--Altogether 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}13158{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}13159{_}to 1s.

10136-8{_}13164{_}[Illustration: WILD RABBITS.]
10136-8{_}13165{_}THE COMMON OR WILD RABBIT.--Warrens, or inclosures, are     frequently made in favourable localities, and some of them are     so large as to comprise 2,000 acres.
10136-8{_}13166{_}The common wild rabbit is     of a grey colour, and is esteemed the best for the purposes of     food.
10136-8{_}13167{_}Its skin is valuable as an article of commerce, being used     for the making of hats.
10136-8{_}13168{_}Another variety of the rabbit, however,     called the "silver-grey," has been lately introduced to this     country, and is still more valuable.
10136-8{_}13169{_}Its colour is a black     ground, thickly interspersed with grey hairs; and its powers as     a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be     enormous, especially by those who have gardens in the vicinity     of a rabbit-warren.
10136-8{_}13170{_}FRIED RABBIT.
10136-8{_}13171{_}979.
10136-8{_}13172{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, flour, dripping, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}13173{_}of butter, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}13174{_}_Mode_.--Cut the rabbit into neat joints, and flour them well; make the dripping boiling in a fryingpan, put in the rabbit, and fry it a nice brown.
10136-8{_}13175{_}Have ready a very hot dish, put in the butter, shalot, and ketchup; arrange the rabbit pyramidically on this, and serve as quickly as possible.
10136-8{_}13176{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.

10136-8{_}13183{_}_Note_.--The rabbit may be brushed over with egg, and sprinkled with bread crumbs, and fried as above.
10136-8{_}13184{_}When cooked in this manner, make a gravy in the pan by recipe No.
10136-8{_}13185{_}866, and pour it round, but not over, the pieces of rabbit.
10136-8{_}13186{_}VARIETIES IN RABBITS.--Almost everybody knows that a rabbit is a     furry animal, that lives on plants, and burrows in the ground;     that it has its varieties as well as other animals, and that it     is frequently an especial favourite with boys.
10136-8{_}13187{_}Among its     varieties, the short-legged, with width and substance of loin,     is the most hardy, and fattens the most expeditiously.
10136-8{_}13188{_}It has,     besides, the soundest liver, rabbits generally being subject to     defects of that part.
10136-8{_}13189{_}It is also the smallest variety.
10136-8{_}13190{_}There is     a very large species of the hare-colour, having much bone,     length and depth of carcase, large and long ears, with full     eyes, resembling those of the hare: it might readily be taken     for a hybrid or mule, but for the objection to its breeding.
10136-8{_}13191{_}Its     flesh is high-coloured, substantial, and more savoury than that     of the common rabbit; and, cooked like the hare, it makes a good     dish.
10136-8{_}13192{_}The large white, and yellow and white species, have whiter     and more delicate flesh, and, cooked in the same way, will rival     the turkey.
10136-8{_}13193{_}Rabbits are divided into four kinds, distinguished     as warreners, parkers, hedgehogs, and sweethearts.
10136-8{_}13194{_}The warrener,     as his name implies, is a member of a subterranean community,     and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell _upon_ the     earth and have "the world at their will," and his fur is the     most esteemed.
10136-8{_}13195{_}After him, comes the parker, whose favourite     resort is a gentleman's pleasure-ground, where he usually breeds     in great numbers, and from which he frequently drives away the     hares.
10136-8{_}13196{_}The hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit, that, tinker     like, roams about the country, and would have a much better coat     on his back if he was more settled in his habits, and remained     more at home.
10136-8{_}13197{_}The sweetheart is a tame rabbit, with its fur so     sleek, soft, and silky, that it is also used to some extent in     the important branch of hat-making.

10136-8{_}13202{_}_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it into joints.
10136-8{_}13203{_}Put the butter into a stewpan with the pieces of rabbit; add salt, pepper, and pounded mace, and let it cook until three parts done; then put in the remaining ingredients, and boil for about 10 minutes: it will then be ready to serve.

10136-8{_}13214{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, a few slices of ham, salt and white pepper to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, a few forcemeat balls, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of gravy, puff crust.
10136-8{_}13215{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the rabbit (which should be young), remove the breastbone, and bone the legs.
10136-8{_}13216{_}Put the rabbit, slices of ham, forcemeat balls, and hard eggs, by turns, in layers, and season each layer with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}13217{_}Pour in about 1/2 pint of water, cover with crust, and bake in a well-heated oven for about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}13218{_}Should the crust acquire too much colour, place a piece of paper over it to prevent its burning.
10136-8{_}13219{_}When done, pour in at the top, by means of the hole in the middle of the crust, a little good gravy, which may be made of the breast- and leg-bones of the rabbit and 2 or 3 shank-bones, flavoured with onion, herbs, and spices.
10136-8{_}13220{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}13226{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}13227{_}Note.--The liver of the rabbit may be boiled, minced, and mixed with the forcemeat balls, when the flavour is liked.
10136-8{_}13228{_}FECUNDITY OF THE RABBIT.--The fruitfulness of this animal has     been the subject of wonder to all naturalists.
10136-8{_}13229{_}It breeds seven     times in the year, and generally begets seven or eight young     ones at a time.
10136-8{_}13230{_}If we suppose this to happen regularly for a     period of four years, the progeny that would spring from a     single pair would amount to more than a million.
10136-8{_}13231{_}As the rabbit,     however, has many enemies, it can never be permitted to increase     in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind;     for it not only furnishes man with an article of food, but is,     by carnivorous animals of every description, mercilessly     sacrificed.
10136-8{_}13232{_}Notwithstanding this, however, in the time of the     Roman power, they once infested the Balearic islands to such an     extent, that the inhabitants were obliged to implore the     assistance of a military force from Augustus to exterminate     them.
10136-8{_}13233{_}RAGOUT OF RABBIT OR HARE.
10136-8{_}13234{_}982.
10136-8{_}13235{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 3 teaspoonfuls of flour, 3 sliced onions, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}13236{_}of butter, a few thin slices of bacon, pepper and salt to taste, 2 slices of lemon, 1 bay-leaf, 1 glass of port wine.
10136-8{_}13237{_}_Mode_.--Slice the onions, and put them into a stewpan with the flour and butter; place the pan near the fire, stir well as the butter melts, till the onions become a rich brown colour, and add, by degrees, a little water or gravy till the mixture is of the consistency of cream.
10136-8{_}13238{_}Cut some thin slices of bacon; lay in these with the rabbit, cut into neat joints; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, the lemon and bay-leaf, and let the whole simmer until tender.
10136-8{_}13239{_}Pour in the port wine, give one boil, and serve.
10136-8{_}13240{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to simmer the rabbit.

10136-8{_}13247{_}THE RABBIT-HOUSE.--Rabbit-keeping is generally practised by a     few individuals in almost every town, and by a few in almost     every part of the country.
10136-8{_}13248{_}Forty years ago, there were in the     metropolis one or two considerable feeders, who, according to     report, kept from 1,600 to 2,000 breeding does.
10136-8{_}13249{_}These large     establishments, however, have ceased to exist, and London     receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from     the country.
10136-8{_}13250{_}Where they are kept, however, the rabbit-house     should be placed upon a dry foundation, and be well ventilated.
10136-8{_}13251{_}Exposure to rain, whether externally or internally, is fatal to     rabbits, which, like sheep, are liable to the rot, springing     from the same causes.
10136-8{_}13252{_}Thorough ventilation and good air are     indispensable where many rabbits are kept, or they will neither     prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time.
10136-8{_}13253{_}A thorough     draught or passage for the air is, therefore, absolutely     necessary, and should be so contrived as to be checked in cold     or wet weather by the closing or shutting of opposite doors or     windows.
10136-8{_}13254{_}ROAST OR BAKED RABBIT.
10136-8{_}13255{_}983.
10136-8{_}13256{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}13257{_}417, buttered paper, sausage-meat.
10136-8{_}13258{_}[Illustration: ROAST RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13259{_}_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and thoroughly wash the rabbit; wipe it dry, line the inside with sausage-meat and forcemeat made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}13260{_}417, and to which has been added the minced liver.
10136-8{_}13261{_}Sew the stuffing inside, skewer back the head between the shoulders, cut off the fore-joints of the shoulders and legs, bring: them close to the body, and secure them by means of a skewer.
10136-8{_}13262{_}Wrap the rabbit in buttered paper, and put it down to a bright clear fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before it is done remove the paper, flour and froth it, and let it acquire a nice brown colour.
10136-8{_}13263{_}Take out the skewers, and serve with brown gravy and red-currant jelly.
10136-8{_}13264{_}To bake the rabbit, proceed in the same manner as above; in a good oven, it will take about the same time as roasting.
10136-8{_}13265{_}_Time_.--A young rabbit, 35 minutes; a large one, about 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}13266{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}13267{_}to 1s.

10136-8{_}13271{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}13272{_}THE HUTCH.--Hutches are generally placed one above another to     the height required by the number of rabbits and the extent of     the room.
10136-8{_}13273{_}Where a large stock is kept, to make the most of room,     the hutches may be placed in rows, with a sufficient interval     between for feeding and cleaning, instead of being, in the usual     way, joined to the wall.
10136-8{_}13274{_}It is preferable to rest the hutches     upon stands, about a foot above the ground, for the convenience     of cleaning under them.
10136-8{_}13275{_}Each of the hutches intended for     breeding should have two rooms,--a feeding and a bed-room.
10136-8{_}13276{_}Those     are single for the use of the weaned rabbits, or for the bucks,     which are always kept separate.
10136-8{_}13277{_}The floors should be planed     smooth, that wet may run off, and a common hoe, with a short     handle, and a short broom, are most convenient implements for     cleaning these houses.
10136-8{_}13278{_}STEWED RABBIT.
10136-8{_}13279{_}984.
10136-8{_}13280{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 2 large onions, 6 cloves, 1 small teaspoonful of chopped lemon-peel, a few forcemeat balls, thickening of butter and flour, 1 large tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.
10136-8{_}13281{_}_Mode_.--Cut the rabbit into small joints; put them into a stewpan, add the onions sliced, the cloves, and minced lemon-peel.
10136-8{_}13282{_}Pour in sufficient water to cover the meat, and, when the rabbit is nearly done, drop in a few forcemeat balls, to which has been added the liver, finely chopped.
10136-8{_}13283{_}Thicken the gravy with flour and butter, put in the ketchup, give one boil, and serve.
10136-8{_}13284{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}13285{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}13286{_}to 1s.
10136-8{_}13287{_}6d each.
10136-8{_}13288{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}13289{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}13290{_}[Illustration: LOP-EARED RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13291{_}FANCY RABBITS.--The graceful fall of the ears is the first thing     that is looked to by the fancier; next, the dewlap, if the     animal is in its prime; then the colours and marked points, and,     lastly, the shape and general appearance.
10136-8{_}13292{_}The ears of a fine     rabbit should extend not less than seven inches, measured from     tip to tip in a line across the skull; but even should they     exceed this length, they are admitted with reluctance into a     fancy stock, unless they have a uniform and graceful droop.
10136-8{_}13293{_}The     dewlap, which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat, is     only seen in fancy rabbits, after they have attained their full     growth: it commences immediately under the jaw, and adds greatly     to the beauty of their appearance.
10136-8{_}13294{_}It goes down the throat and     between the fore legs, and is so broad that it projects beyond     the chin.
10136-8{_}13295{_}The difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back,     independent of the ears, is sufficient to strike the common     observer.
10136-8{_}13296{_}Fancy rabbits fetch a very high price; so much as five     and ten guineas, and even more, is sometimes given for a     first-rate doe.
10136-8{_}13297{_}If young ones are first procured from a good     family, the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for     a much smaller sum.
10136-8{_}13298{_}Sometimes the ears, instead of drooping     down, slope backwards: a rabbit with this characteristic is     scarcely admitted into a fancy lot, and is not considered worth     more than the common variety.
10136-8{_}13299{_}The next position is when one ear     lops outwards, and the other stands erect: rabbits of this kind     possess but little value, however fine the shape and beautiful     the colour, although they sometimes breed as good specimens as     finer ones.
10136-8{_}13300{_}The forward or horn-lop is one degree nearer perfection than the     half-lop: the ears, in this case, slope forward and down over     the forehead.
10136-8{_}13301{_}Rabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in     other respects, with the exception of the droop of the ears, and     often become the parents of perfect young ones: does of this     kind often have the power of lifting an ear erect.
10136-8{_}13302{_}In the     ear-lop, the ears spread out in an horizontal position, like the     wings of a bird in flight, or the arms of a man swimming.
10136-8{_}13303{_}A     great many excellent does have this characteristic, and some of     the best-bred bucks in the fancy are entirely so.
10136-8{_}13304{_}Sometimes a     rabbit drops one ear completely, but raises the other so neatly     horizontally as to constitute an ear-lop: this is superior to     all others, except the perfect fall, which is so rarely to be     met with, that those which are merely ear-lopped are considered     as valuable rabbits, if well bred and with other good qualities.
10136-8{_}13305{_}"The real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek,     slanting somewhat outward in their descent, with the open part     of the ear inward, and sometimes either backwards or forwards     instead of perpendicular: when the animals stand in an easy     position, the tips of the ears touch the ground.
10136-8{_}13306{_}The hollows of     the ears, in a fancy rabbit of a first-rate kind, should be     turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them     should remain in front: they should match exactly in their     descent, and should slant outwards as little as possible."
10136-8{_}13307{_}The same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare, that a     breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect     does would consider himself lucky if, in the course of a year,     he managed to raise twelve full-lopped rabbits out of them all.
10136-8{_}13308{_}As regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder     says:--      "The fur of fancy rabbits may be blue, or rather lead-colour,     and white, or black and white, or tawny and white, that is,     tortoiseshell-coloured.
10136-8{_}13309{_}But it is not of so much importance what     colours the coat of a rabbit displays, as it is that those     colours shall be arranged in a particular manner, forming     imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects.
10136-8{_}13310{_}Hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by     distinctive designations.
10136-8{_}13311{_}What is termed 'the blue butterfly     smut' was, for some time, considered the most valuable of fancy     rabbits.
10136-8{_}13312{_}It is thus named on account of having bluish or     lead-coloured spots on either side of the nose, having some     resemblance to the spread wings of a butterfly, what may be     termed the groundwork of the rabbit's face being white.
10136-8{_}13313{_}A black     and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar     manner, constituting a 'black butterfly smut.'
10136-8{_}13314{_}"But A good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks, without     which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind.
10136-8{_}13315{_}There     should be a black or blue patch on its back, called the saddle;     the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout;     while the legs should be all white; and there ought to be dark     stripes on both sides of the body in front, passing backwards to     meet the saddle, and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the     part called the withers in a horse.
10136-8{_}13316{_}These stripes form what is     termed the 'chain' having somewhat the appearance of a chain or     collar hanging round the neck."
10136-8{_}13317{_}"Among thorough-bred fancy rabbits, perhaps not one in a hundred     will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on     the coat; but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a     rabbit approach to the pattern described, the greater will be     its value, so far, at least, as relates to colour.
10136-8{_}13318{_}The beauty     and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit, however, depends a good     deal on its shape, or what is styled its carriage.
10136-8{_}13319{_}A rabbit is     said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched,     rising full two inches above the top of its head, which must be     held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to     reach almost to the ground."
10136-8{_}13320{_}STEWED RABBIT, Larded.
10136-8{_}13321{_}985.
10136-8{_}13322{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, a few strips of bacon, rather more than 1 pint of good broth or stock, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of sherry.
10136-8{_}13323{_}_Mode_.--Well wash the rabbit, cut it into quarters, lard them with Blips of bacon, and fry them; then put them into a stewpan with the broth, herbs, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; simmer gently until the rabbit is tender, then strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add the sherry, give one boil, pour it over the rabbit, and serve.
10136-8{_}13324{_}Garnish with slices of cut lemon.
10136-8{_}13325{_}_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}13332{_}[Illustration: THE HARE-RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13333{_}THE HARE-RABBIT.--There has been lately introduced to French     tables an animal called the "Hare-rabbit," partaking of the     nature, characteristics, and qualifications of both the hare and     the rabbit.
10136-8{_}13334{_}It is highly spoken of, both as regards flesh and     flavour; and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to     perpetuate its race.
10136-8{_}13335{_}We hope that some enterprising individual     will soon secure for English, tables what would seem to be a     really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes;     although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its     proper position, as within or without the meaning of "game," as     by law established.
10136-8{_}13336{_}Only a few specimens have been seen in     England at present, but there is no reason to doubt that our     rabbit-fanciers will prove equal to the occasion, and cope     successfully with our neighbours across the Channel in     introducing a new animal serviceable in the kitchen.
10136-8{_}13337{_}[Illustration: ANGORA RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13338{_}THE ANGORA RABBIT.--This is one of the handsomest of all     rabbits.
10136-8{_}13339{_}It takes its name from being an inhabitant of Angora, a     city and district of Asia Minor.
10136-8{_}13340{_}Like the well-known Angora goat     and cat, both of which are valuable on account of the fineness     of their wool and fur, this rabbit is prized for its long,     waved, silky fur, which, as an article of commerce is highly     esteemed.
10136-8{_}13341{_}We are not aware whether it is eaten by the     inhabitants, and but few specimens have been introduced into     England, where, doubtless, the beauty of its coat would     materially suffer from the more humid and less genial character     of the climate.
10136-8{_}13342{_}To the rabbits of the ancient and mountainous     district of Angora the words of the wise man would seem most to     apply, "The conies are but feeble folk, yet make they their     houses in the rocks."
10136-8{_}13343{_}[Illustration: HIMALAYA RABBITS.]
10136-8{_}13344{_}THE HIMALAYA RABBIT.--Amidst the mighty Himalaya mountains,     whose peaks are the highest on the globe, the pretty rabbit here     portrayed is found; and his colour seems to be like the snow,     which, above the altitude of from 13,000 to 16,000 feet,     perpetually crowns the summits of these monarchs of the world.
10136-8{_}13345{_}It is, at present, a very rare animal in England, but will,     doubtless, be more extensively known in the course of a few     years.

10136-8{_}13347{_}BOILED TURKEY.
10136-8{_}13348{_}986.
10136-8{_}13349{_}INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}13350{_}417.
10136-8{_}13351{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling, on account of their whiteness and tenderness, and one of moderate size should be selected, as a large one is not suitable for this mode of cooking.
10136-8{_}13352{_}They should not be dressed until they have been killed 3 or 4 days, as they will neither look white, nor will they be tender.
10136-8{_}13353{_}Pluck the bird, carefully draw, and singe it with a piece of white paper, wash it inside and out, and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth.
10136-8{_}13354{_}Cut off the head and neck, draw the strings or sinews of the thighs, and cut off the legs at the first joint; draw the legs into the body, fill the breast with forcemeat made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}13355{_}417; run a skewer through the wing and the middle joint of the leg, quite into the leg and wing on the opposite side; break the breastbone, and make the bird look as round and as compact as possible.
10136-8{_}13356{_}[Illustration: BOILED TURKEY.]
10136-8{_}13357{_}_Mode_.--Put the turkey into sufficient _hot_ water to cover it; let it come to a boil, then carefully remove all the scum: if this is attended to, there is no occasion to boil the bird in a floured cloth; but it should be well covered with the water.
10136-8{_}13358{_}Let it simmer very gently for about 1-1/2 hour to 1-3/4 hour, according to the size, and serve with either white, celery, oyster, or mushroom sauce, or parsley-and-butter, a little of which should be poured over the turkey.
10136-8{_}13359{_}Boiled ham, bacon, tongue, or pickled pork, should always accompany this dish; and when oyster sauce is served, the turkey should be stuffed with oyster forcemeat.
10136-8{_}13360{_}_Time_.--A small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; a large one, 1-3/4 hour.

10136-8{_}13366{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}13367{_}_Seasonable_ from December to February.
10136-8{_}13368{_}THE TURKEY.--The turkey, for which fine bird we are indebted to     America, is certainly one of the most glorious presents made by     the New World to the Old.
10136-8{_}13369{_}Some, indeed, assert that this bird     was known to the ancients, and that it was served at the     wedding-feast of Charlemagne.
10136-8{_}13370{_}This opinion, however, has been     controverted by first-rate authorities, who declare that the     French name of the bird, _dindon_, proves its origin; that the     form of the bird is altogether foreign, and that it is found in     America alone in a wild state.
10136-8{_}13371{_}There is but little doubt, from     the information which has been gained at considerable trouble,     that it appeared, generally, in Europe about the end of the 17th     century; that it was first imported into France by Jesuits, who     had been sent out missionaries to the West; and that from France     it spread over Europe.
10136-8{_}13372{_}To this day, in many localities in     France, a turkey is called a Jesuit.
10136-8{_}13373{_}On the farms of N. America,     where turkeys are very common, they are raised either from eggs     which have been found, or from young ones caught in the woods:     they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage.
10136-8{_}13374{_}The     turkey only became gradually acclimated, both on the continent     and in England: in the middle of the 18th century, scarcely 10     out of 20 young turkeys lived; now, generally speaking, 15 out     of the same number arrive at maturity.

10136-8{_}13377{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turkey; to every 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}13378{_}of meat allow 2 oz.
10136-8{_}13379{_}of ham or bacon, 2 shalots, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}13380{_}of butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}13381{_}_Mode_.--The smaller pieces, that will not do for a fricassée or hash, answer very well for this dish.
10136-8{_}13382{_}Mince the meat finely with ham or bacon in the above proportion; make a gravy of the bones and trimmings, well seasoning it; mince the shalots, put them into a stewpan with the butter, add the flour; mix well, then put in the mince, and about 1/2 pint of the gravy made from the bones.
10136-8{_}13383{_}(The proportion of the butter must be increased or diminished according to the quantity of mince.)
10136-8{_}13384{_}When just boiled, add the yolks of 2 eggs; put the mixture out to cool, and then shape it in a wineglass.
10136-8{_}13385{_}Cover the croquettes with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them a delicate brown.
10136-8{_}13386{_}Put small pieces of parsley-stems for stalks, and serve with, rolled bacon cut very thin.
10136-8{_}13387{_}_Time_.--8 minutes to fry the croquettes.
10136-8{_}13388{_}_Seasonable_ from December to February.
10136-8{_}13389{_}THE WILD TURKEY.--In its wild state, the turkey is gregarious,     going together in extensive flocks, numbering as many as five     hundred.
10136-8{_}13390{_}These frequent the great swamps of America, where they     roost; but, at sunrise, leave these situations to repair to the     dry woods, in search of berries and acorns.
10136-8{_}13391{_}They perch on the     boughs of trees, and, by rising from branch to branch, attain     the height they desire.
10136-8{_}13392{_}They usually mount to the highest tops,     apparently from an instinctive conception that the loftier they     are the further they are out of danger.
10136-8{_}13393{_}They fly awkwardly, but     run with great swiftness, and, about the month of March become     so fat as not to be able to take a flight beyond three or four     hundred yards, and are then, also, easily run down by a     horseman.
10136-8{_}13394{_}Now, however, it rarely happens that wild turkeys are     seen in the inhabited parts of America.
10136-8{_}13395{_}It is only in the     distant and more unfrequented parts that they are found in great     numbers.
10136-8{_}13396{_}FRICASSEED TURKEY (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}13397{_}988.
10136-8{_}13398{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled turkey; a strip of lemon-peel, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, the yolk of an egg.
10136-8{_}13399{_}_Mode_.--Cut some nice slices from the remains of a cold turkey, and put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan, with the lemon-peel, herbs, onion, pepper, salt, add the water; stew for an hour, strain the gravy, and lay in the pieces of turkey.
10136-8{_}13400{_}When warm through, add the cream and the yolk of an egg; stir it well round, and, when getting thick, take out the pieces, lay them on a hot dish, and pour the sauce over.
10136-8{_}13401{_}Garnish the fricassée with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}13402{_}Celery or cucumbers, cut into small pieces, may be put into the sauce; if the former, it must be boiled first.
10136-8{_}13403{_}_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy.
10136-8{_}13404{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold turkey, 4d.
10136-8{_}13405{_}_Seasonable_ from December to February.
10136-8{_}13406{_}THE TURKEY.--This is one of the gallinaceous birds, the     principal genera of which are Pheasants, Turkeys, Peacocks,     Bustards, Pintatoes, and Grouse.
10136-8{_}13407{_}They live mostly on the ground,     scraping the earth with their feet, and feeding on seeds and     grains, which, previous to digestion, are macerated in their     crops.
10136-8{_}13408{_}They usually associate in families, consisting of one     male and several females.
10136-8{_}13409{_}Turkeys are particularly fond of the     seeds of nettles, whilst the seeds of the foxglove will poison     them.
10136-8{_}13410{_}The common turkey is a native of North America, and, in     the reign of Henry VIII., was introduced into England.
10136-8{_}13411{_}According     to Tusser's "Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry," it began     about the year 1585 to form a dish at our rural Christmas     feasts:--        "Beefe, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best,       Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well drest;       Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear,       As then in the country is counted good cheer."
10136-8{_}13412{_}The turkey is one of the most difficult birds to rear, and its     flesh is much esteemed.
10136-8{_}13413{_}THE DISPOSITION OF THE TURKEY.--Among themselves, turkeys are     extremely furious, whilst amongst other animals they are usually     both weak and cowardly.
10136-8{_}13414{_}The domestic cock frequently makes them     keep at a distance, whilst they will rarely attack him but in a     united body, when the cock is rather crushed by their weight     than defeated by their prowess.
10136-8{_}13415{_}The disposition of the female is     in general much more gentle than that of the male.
10136-8{_}13416{_}When leading     forth her young to collect their food, though so large and     apparently so powerful a bird, she gives them very slight     protection from the attacks of any rapacious animal which may     appear against them.
10136-8{_}13417{_}She rather warns them of their danger than     offers to defend them; yet she is extremely affectionate to her     young.
10136-8{_}13418{_}HASHED TURKEY.
10136-8{_}13419{_}989.
10136-8{_}13420{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast turkey, 1 onion, pepper and salt to taste, rather more than 1 pint of water, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 blade of mace, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine, thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}13421{_}_Mode_.--Cut the turkey into neat joints; the best pieces reserve for the hash, the inferior joints and trimmings put into a stewpan with an onion cut in slices, pepper and salt, a carrot, turnip, mace, herbs, and water in the above proportion; simmer these for an hour, then strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, flavour with ketchup and port wine, and lay in the pieces of turkey to warm through; if there is any stuffing left, put that in also, as it so much improves the flavour of the gravy.
10136-8{_}13422{_}When it boils, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}13423{_}_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy.
10136-8{_}13424{_}_Seasonable_ from December to February.
10136-8{_}13425{_}HUNTING TURKEYS.--Formerly, in Canada, hunting turkeys was one     of the principal diversions of the natives of that country.
10136-8{_}13426{_}When     they discovered the retreat of the birds, which was generally     near a field of nettles, or where grain of any kind was     plentiful, they would send a well-trained dog into the midst of     the flock.
10136-8{_}13427{_}The turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they     would run off at full speed, and with such swiftness that they     would leave the dog far behind.
10136-8{_}13428{_}He, however, would follow in     their wake, and as they could not, for a great length of time,     continue at their speed, they were at last forced to seek     shelter in the trees.
10136-8{_}13429{_}There they would sit, spent with fatigue,     till the hunters would approach, and, with long poles, knock     them down one after the other.
10136-8{_}13430{_}ROAST TURKEY.
10136-8{_}13431{_}990.
10136-8{_}13432{_}INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}13433{_}417.
10136-8{_}13434{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose cock turkeys by their short spurs and black legs, in which case they are young; if the spurs are long, and the legs pale and rough, they are old.
10136-8{_}13435{_}If the bird has been long killed, the eyes will appear sunk and the feet very dry; but, if fresh, the contrary will be the case.
10136-8{_}13436{_}Middling-sized fleshy turkeys are by many persons considered superior to those of an immense growth, as they are, generally speaking, much more tender.
10136-8{_}13437{_}They should never be dressed the same day they are killed; but, in cold weather, should hang at least 8 days; if the weather is mild, 4 or 5 days will be found sufficient.
10136-8{_}13438{_}Carefully pluck the bird, singe it with white paper, and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve the liver and gizzard, and be particular not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will remove the bitter taste it imparts where it once touches.
10136-8{_}13439{_}Wash it _inside_ well, and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth; the _outside_ merely requires nicely wiping, as we have just stated.
10136-8{_}13440{_}Cut off the neck close to the back, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over; break the leg-bone close below the knee, draw out the strings from the thighs, and flatten the breastbone to make it look plump.
10136-8{_}13441{_}Have ready a forcemeat made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}13442{_}417; fill the breast with this, and, if a trussing-needle is used, sew the neck over to the back; if a needle is not at hand, a skewer will answer the purpose.
10136-8{_}13443{_}Run a skewer through the pinion and thigh into the body to the pinion and thigh on the other side, and press the legs as much as possible between the breast and the side bones, and put the liver under one pinion and the gizzard under the other.
10136-8{_}13444{_}Pass a string across the back of the bird, catch it over the points of the skewer, tie it in the centre of the back, and be particular that the turkey is very firmly trussed.
10136-8{_}13445{_}This may be more easily accomplished with a needle and twine than with skewers.
10136-8{_}13446{_}[Illustration: ROAST TURKEY.]
10136-8{_}13447{_}_Mode_.--Fasten a sheet of buttered paper on to the breast of the bird, put it down to a bright fire, at some little distance _at first_ (afterwards draw it nearer), and keep it well basted the whole of the time it is cooking.
10136-8{_}13448{_}About 1/4 hour before serving, remove the paper, dredge the turkey lightly with flour, and put a piece of butter into the basting-ladle; as the butter melts, baste the bird with it.
10136-8{_}13449{_}When of a nice brown and well frothed, serve with a tureen of good brown gravy and one of bread sauce.
10136-8{_}13450{_}Fried sausages are a favourite addition to roast turkey; they make a pretty garnish, besides adding very much to the flavour.
10136-8{_}13451{_}When these are not at hand, a few forcemeat balls should be placed round the dish as a garnish.
10136-8{_}13452{_}Turkey may also be stuffed with sausage-meat, and a chestnut forcemeat with the same sauce is, by many persons, much esteemed as an accompaniment to this favourite dish.--See coloured plate, A1.
10136-8{_}13453{_}_Time_.--Small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; moderate-sized one, about 10 lbs., 2 hours; large turkey, 2-1/2 hours, or longer.
10136-8{_}13454{_}_Average cost_, from 10s.
10136-8{_}13455{_}to 12s., but expensive at Christmas, on account of the great demand.
10136-8{_}13456{_}_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized turkey for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}13457{_}_Seasonable_ from December to February.
10136-8{_}13458{_}ENGLISH TURKEYS.--These are reared in great numbers in Suffolk,     Norfolk, and several other counties, whence they were wont to be     driven to the London market in flocks of several hundreds; the     improvements in our modes of travelling now, however, enable     them to be brought by railway.
10136-8{_}13459{_}Their drivers used to manage them     with great facility, by means of a bit of red rag tied to the     end of a long stick, which, from the antipathy these birds have     to that colour, effectually answered the purpose of a scourge.
10136-8{_}13460{_}There are three varieties of the turkey in this country,--the     black, the white, and the speckled, or copper-coloured.
10136-8{_}13461{_}The     black approaches nearest to the original stock, and is esteemed     the best.
10136-8{_}13462{_}Its flesh is white and tender, delicate, nourishing,     and of excellent flavour; it greatly deteriorates with age,     however, and is then good for little but stewing.
10136-8{_}13463{_}ROAST TURKEY POULTS.
10136-8{_}13464{_}991.
10136-8{_}13465{_}INGREDIENTS.--Turkey poult; butter.
10136-8{_}13466{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose a plump bird, and truss it in the following manner:--After it has been carefully plucked, drawn, and singed, skin the neck, and fasten the head under the wing; turn the legs at the first joint, and bring the feet close to the thighs, as a woodcock should be trussed, _and do not stuff it_.
10136-8{_}13467{_}_Mode_.--Put it down to a bright fire, keep it well basted, and at first place a piece of paper on the breast to prevent its taking too much colour.
10136-8{_}13468{_}About 10 minutes before serving, dredge it lightly with flour, and baste well; when nicely frothed, send it to table immediately, with a little gravy in the dish, and some in a tureen.
10136-8{_}13469{_}If at hand, a few water-cresses may be placed round the turkey as a garnish, or it may be larded.
10136-8{_}13470{_}_Time_.--About 1 hour.
10136-8{_}13471{_}_Average cost_, 7s.
10136-8{_}13472{_}to 8s.
10136-8{_}13473{_}each.
10136-8{_}13474{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}13475{_}_Seasonable_.--In full season from June to October.
10136-8{_}13476{_}THE FUTURE OF THE TURKEY.--Human ingenuity subjects almost every     material to the purposes of ornament or use and the feathers of     turkeys have been found adapted for more ends than one.
10136-8{_}13477{_}The     American Indians convert then into an elegant clothing, and, by     twisting the inner ribs into a strong double string, with hemp     or the inner bark of the mulberry tree, work it like matting.
10136-8{_}13478{_}This fabric has a very rich and glossy appearance and is as fine     as silk shag.
10136-8{_}13479{_}The natives of Louisiana used to make fans of the     tail; and four of that appendage joined together was formerly     constructed into a parasol by the French.
10136-8{_}13480{_}TO BONE A TURKEY OR FOWL WITHOUT OPENING IT.
10136-8{_}13481{_}(_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}13482{_}992.
10136-8{_}13483{_}After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out with a clean cloth, but do not wash it.
10136-8{_}13484{_}Take off the head, cut through the skin all round the first joint of the legs, and pull them from the fowl, to draw out the large tendons.
10136-8{_}13485{_}Raise the flesh first from the lower part of the backbone, and a little also from the end of the breastbone, if necessary; work the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh; with the point of the knife detach the joint from it, take the end of the bone firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it down to the next joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefully, and when the skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the next bone, keeping; the edge of the knife close to it, until the whole of the leg is done.
10136-8{_}13486{_}Remove the bones of the other leg in the same manner; then detach the flesh from the back--and breast-bone sufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the wings; proceed with these as with the legs, but be especially careful not to pierce the skin of the second joint: it is usual to leave the pinions unboned, in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowl when it is dressed.
10136-8{_}13487{_}The merrythought and neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the back-and side-bones taken out without being divided, and the breastbone separated carefully from the flesh (which, as the work progresses, must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out).
10136-8{_}13488{_}After the one remaining bone is removed, draw the wings and legs back to their proper form, and turn the fowl right side outwards.
10136-8{_}13489{_}993.
10136-8{_}13490{_}A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner; but as it requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the logs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of this.
10136-8{_}13491{_}If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled, or stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and forced; but it must be most gently cooled, or it may burst.
10136-8{_}13492{_}ANOTHER MODE OF BONING A TURKEY OR FOWL.
10136-8{_}13493{_}(_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}13494{_}994.
10136-8{_}13495{_}Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until the sockets of the wings and thighs are reached.
10136-8{_}13496{_}Till a little practice has been gained, it will perhaps be bettor to bone these joints before proceeding further; but after they are once detached from it, the whole of the body may easily be separated from the flesh and taken out entire: only the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed.
10136-8{_}13497{_}The bird thus prepared may either be restored to its original form, by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with the livers of two or three fowls, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue freed from the rind, fine sausage-meat, or veal forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good flavour, which will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved; and then be sewn up and trussed as usual; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened on a table, may be covered with sausage-meat, and the various other ingredients we have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in every part; then tightly rolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both ends, and dressed as follows:--Put it into a braising-pan, stewpan, or thick iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its size; add all the chicken-bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two bay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white peppercorns, and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand; cover the whole with good veal broth, add salt, if needed, and stew it very softly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed; and after it is lifted out, boil down the gravy to a jelly and strain it; let it become cold, clear off the fat, and serve it cut into large dice or roughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be served cold.
10136-8{_}13498{_}If restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and may then be sent to table hot, covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that may be preferred; or it may be left until the following day, and served garnished with the jelly, which should be firm, and very clear and well-flavoured: the liquor in which a calf's foot has been boiled down, added to the broth, will give it the necessary degree of consistence.
10136-8{_}13499{_}TO BONE FOWLS FOR FRICASSEES, CURRIES, & PIES.
10136-8{_}13500{_}995.
10136-8{_}13501{_}First carve them entirely into joints, then remove the bones, beginning with the legs and wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold this with the fingers, and work the knife as directed in the recipe above.
10136-8{_}13502{_}The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any instructions.
10136-8{_}13503{_}TO DRESS WHEATEARS.
10136-8{_}13504{_}996.
10136-8{_}13505{_}INGREDIENTS.--Wheatears; fresh butter.
10136-8{_}13506{_}_Mode_.--After the birds are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them like larks, put them down to a quick fire, and baste them well with fresh butter.
10136-8{_}13507{_}When done, which will be in about 20 minutes, dish them on fried bread crumbs, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
10136-8{_}13508{_}_Time_.--20 minutes.
10136-8{_}13509{_}_Seasonable_ from July to October.
10136-8{_}13510{_}THE WHEATEAR.--The wheatear is an annual visitor of England: it     arrives about the middle of March and leaves in September.
10136-8{_}13511{_}The     females come about a fortnight before the males, and continue to     arrive till the middle of May.
10136-8{_}13512{_}They are in season from July to     October, and are taken in large numbers on the South Downs, in     the neighbourhood of Eastbourne, Brighton, and other parts of     Sussex.
10136-8{_}13513{_}They are taken by means of snares and nets, and numbers     of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabitants.
10136-8{_}13514{_}The larger     ones are sent to London and potted, where they are by many as     much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent.
10136-8{_}13515{_}Mr. Pennant     assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about     Eastbourne, the existence of a species of fly which forms their     favourite food, and which feeds on the wild thyme on the     adjacent hills.
10136-8{_}13516{_}[Illustration: THE GUINEA-PIG.]
10136-8{_}13517{_}997.
10136-8{_}13518{_}THE GUINEA-PIG.--This common hutch-companion of the rabbit,     although originally a native of Brazil, propagates freely in     England and other European countries.
10136-8{_}13519{_}Were it not that they     suffer cruelly from cats, and numerous other enemies, and that     it is the habit of the males to devour their own offspring,     their numbers would soon become overwhelming.
10136-8{_}13520{_}Rats, however, it     is said, carefully avoid them; and for this reason they are     frequently bred by rabbit-fanciers, by way of protection for     their young stock against those troublesome vermin.
10136-8{_}13521{_}The lower     tier of a rabbit-hutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the     guinea-pig: here, as he runs loose, he will devour the waste     food of his more admired companion.
10136-8{_}13522{_}Home naturalists assert that     the guinea-pig will breed at two months old, the litter varying     from four to twelve at a time.
10136-8{_}13523{_}It is varied in colour,--white,     fawn, and black, and a mixture of the three colours, forming a     tortoiseshell, which is the more generally admired hue.
10136-8{_}13524{_}Occasionally, the white ones have red eyes, like those of the     ferret and the white rabbit.
10136-8{_}13525{_}Their flesh, although eatable, is     decidedly unfit for food; they have been tasted, however, we     presume by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of     science, or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new     pleasure for his palate.
10136-8{_}13526{_}Unless it has been that they deter rats     from intruding within the rabbit-hutch, they are as useless as     they are harmless.
10136-8{_}13527{_}The usual ornament of an animal's hind     quarters is denied them; and were it not for this fact, and also     for their difference in colour, the Shaksperean locution, "a rat     without a tail," would designate them very properly.
10136-8{_}13528{_}[Illustration: THE CYGNET.]

10136-8{_}13530{_}THE CYGNET.--The Cygnet, or the young Swan, was formerly     much esteemed; but it has "fallen from its high estate," and is     now rarely seen upon the table.
10136-8{_}13531{_}We are not sure that it is not     still fattened in Norwich for the corporation of that place.
10136-8{_}13532{_}Persons who have property on the river there, take the young     birds, and send them to some one who is employed by the     corporation, to be fed; and for this trouble he is paid, or was     wont to be paid, about half a guinea a bird.
10136-8{_}13533{_}It is as the future     bird of elegance and grace that the young swan is mostly     admired; when it has become old enough to grace the waters, then     it is that all admire her, when she with                       "Archèd neck,       Between her white wings mantling,         proudly rows       Her state with oary feet."

10136-8{_}13538{_}No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as do game and poultry; for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly the proper point.
10136-8{_}13539{_}A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a carver's powers and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of the good humour of those in the neighbourhood of the carver; for a sudden tilt of the dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the right or left-hand supporter of the host.
10136-8{_}13540{_}We will endeavour to assist those who are unacquainted with the "gentle art of carving," and also those who are but slightly acquainted with it, by simply describing the rules to follow, and referring to the distinctly-marked Illustrations of each dish, which will further help to bring light to the minds of the uninitiated.
10136-8{_}13541{_}If the bird be a young duckling, it may be carved like a fowl, viz., by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side, as described at No.
10136-8{_}13542{_}1000; but in cases where the duckling is very small, it will be as well not to separate the leg from the wing, as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving.
10136-8{_}13543{_}After the legs and wings are disposed of, the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner as a fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced, as ducklings are tender, and the joints are easily broken by a little gentle forcing, or penetrated by the knife.
10136-8{_}13544{_}In cases where the duck is a large bird, the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose, that is, by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by the lines marked from 1 to 2, commencing to carve the slices close to the wing, and then proceeding upwards from that to the breastbone.
10136-8{_}13545{_}If more should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the breast, then the legs and wings must be attacked, in the same way as is described in connection with carving a fowl.
10136-8{_}13546{_}It may be here remarked, that as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward than those of a fowl, their position causing the waddling motion of the bird, the thigh-bones will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than in a chicken: this is the only difference worth mentioning.
10136-8{_}13547{_}The carver should ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would be agreeable; and in order to get at this, a cut should be made below the breast, as shown by the line from 3 to 4, at the part called the "apron," and the spoon inserted.
10136-8{_}13548{_}(As described in the recipe, it is an excellent plan, when a couple of ducks are served, to have one with, and the other without stuffing.)
10136-8{_}13549{_}As to the prime parts of a duck, it has been said that "the wing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer" are severally the best portions.
10136-8{_}13550{_}Some persons are fond of the feet of the duck; and, in trussing, these should never be taken off.
10136-8{_}13551{_}The leg, wing, and neckbone are here shown; so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be when cut off.
10136-8{_}13552{_}[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECKBONE OF DUCK.]
10136-8{_}13553{_}BOILED FOWL.
10136-8{_}13554{_}[Illustration: BOILED FOWL.]
10136-8{_}13555{_}[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECKBONE OF FOWL.]
10136-8{_}13556{_}1000.
10136-8{_}13557{_}This will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry family to carve, unless, as may happen, a very old farmyard occupant, useless for egg-laying purposes, has, by some unlucky mischance, been introduced info the kitchen as a "fine young chicken."
10136-8{_}13558{_}Skill, however, and the application of a small amount of strength, combined with a fine keeping of the temper, will even get over that difficulty.
10136-8{_}13559{_}Fixing the fork firmly in the breast, let the knife be sharply passed along the line shown from 1 to 2; then cut downwards from that line to fig.
10136-8{_}13560{_}3; and the wing, it will be found, can be easily withdrawn.
10136-8{_}13561{_}The shape of the wing should be like the accompanying engraving.
10136-8{_}13562{_}Let the fork be placed inside the leg, which should be gently forced away from the body of the fowl; and the joint, being thus discovered, the carver can readily cut through it, and the leg can be served.
10136-8{_}13563{_}When the leg is displaced, it should be of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut.
10136-8{_}13564{_}The legs and wings on either side having been taken off, the carver should draw his knife through the flesh in the direction of the line 4 to 5: by this means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought, which, being lifted up and pressed backward, will immediately come off.
10136-8{_}13565{_}The collar--or neck-bones are the next to consider: these lie on each side of the merrythought, close under the upper part of the wings; and, in order to free these from the fowl, they must also be raised by the knife at their broad end, and turned from the body towards the breastbone, until the shorter piece of the bone, as shown in the cut, breaks off.
10136-8{_}13566{_}There will now be left only the breast, with the ribs.
10136-8{_}13567{_}The breast can be, without difficulty, disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the latter, which will offer little impediment.
10136-8{_}13568{_}The side-bones are now to be taken off; and to do this, the lower end of the back should be turned from the carver, who should press the point of the knife through the top of the backbone, near the centre, bringing it down towards the end of the back completely through the bone.
10136-8{_}13569{_}If the knife is now turned in the opposite direction, the joint will be easily separated from the vertebra.
10136-8{_}13570{_}The backbone being now uppermost, the fork should be pressed firmly down on it, whilst at the same time the knife should be employed in raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork, and thus the back will be dislocated about its middle.
10136-8{_}13571{_}The wings, breast, and merrythought are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl, and are usually served to the ladies of the company, to whom legs, except as a matter of paramount necessity, should not be given.
10136-8{_}13572{_}Byron gave it as one reason why he did not like dining with ladies, that they always had the wings of the fowls, which he himself preferred.
10136-8{_}13573{_}We heard a gentleman who, when he might have had a wing, declare his partiality for a leg, saying that he had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time, that he had at last come to like them better than the other more prized parts.
10136-8{_}13574{_}If the fowl is, capon-like, very large, slices maybe carved from its breast in the same manner as from a turkey's.
10136-8{_}13575{_}ROAST FOWL.
10136-8{_}13576{_}[Illustration: ROAST FOWL.]
10136-8{_}13577{_}1001.
10136-8{_}13578{_}Generally speaking, it is not necessary so completely to cut up a fowl as we have described in the preceding paragraphs, unless, indeed, a large family party is assembled, and there are a number of "little mouths" to be filled, or some other such circumstances prevail.
10136-8{_}13579{_}A roast fowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl, No.
10136-8{_}13580{_}1000; viz., by cutting along the line from.
10136-8{_}13581{_}1 to 2, and then round the leg between it and the wing.
10136-8{_}13582{_}The markings and detached pieces, as shown in the engravings under the heading of "Boiled Fowl," supersede the necessity of our lengthily again describing the operation.
10136-8{_}13583{_}It may be added, that the liver, being considered a delicacy, should be divided, and one half served with each wing.
10136-8{_}13584{_}In the case of a fowl being shifted, it will be proper to give each guest a portion, unless it be not agreeable to some one of the party.
10136-8{_}13585{_}ROAST GOOSE.
10136-8{_}13586{_}[Illustration: ROAST GOOSE.]
10136-8{_}13587{_}[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECK-BONE OF GOOSE.]
10136-8{_}13588{_}1002.
10136-8{_}13589{_}It would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of happiness to an inexperienced carver, especially if there is a large party to serve, and the slices off the breast should not suffice to satisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites, produced, may be, by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas and Christmas.
10136-8{_}13590{_}The beginning of the task, however, is not in any way difficult.
10136-8{_}13591{_}Evenly-cut slices, not too thick or too thin, should be carved from the breast in the direction of the line from 2 to 3; after the first slice has been cut, a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron, passing it round the line, as indicated by the figures 1, 1, 1: here the stuffing is located, and some of this should be served on each plate, unless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste of some one guest.
10136-8{_}13592{_}If the carver manages cleverly, he will be able to cut a very large number of fine slices off the breast, and the more so if he commences close down by the wing, and carves upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone.
10136-8{_}13593{_}As many slices as can be taken from the breast being carved, the wings should be cut off; and the same process as described in carving boiled fowl, is made use of in this instance, only more dexterity and greater force will most probably be required: the shape of the leg, when disengaged from the body of the goose, should be like that shown in the accompanying engraving.
10136-8{_}13594{_}It will be necessary, perhaps, in taking off the leg, to turn the goose on its side, and then, pressing down the small end of the leg, the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint; the leg being now turned back by the fork, the knife must cut through the joint, loosening the thigh-bone from its socket.
10136-8{_}13595{_}The merrythought, which in a goose is not so large as might be expected, is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowl--by passing the knife under it, and pressing it backwards towards the neck.
10136-8{_}13596{_}The neck-bones, of which we give a cut, are freed by the same process as are those of a fowl; and the same may be said of all the other parts of this bird.
10136-8{_}13597{_}The breast of a goose is the part most esteemed; all parts, however, are good, and full of juicy flavour.
10136-8{_}13598{_}PIGEON.
10136-8{_}13599{_}[Illustration: PIGEON.]
10136-8{_}13600{_}1003.
10136-8{_}13601{_}A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon: the knife is carried sharply in the direction of the line as shown from 1 to 2, entirely through the bird, cutting it into two precisely equal and similar parts.
10136-8{_}13602{_}If it is necessary to make three pieces of it, a small wing should be cut off with the leg on either side, thus serving two guests; and, by this means, there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest.
10136-8{_}13603{_}RABBITS.
10136-8{_}13604{_}[Illustration: BOILED RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13605{_}1004.
10136-8{_}13606{_}In carving a boiled rabbit, let the knife be drawn on each side of the backbone, the whole length of the rabbit, as shown by the dotted line 3 to 4: thus the rabbit will be in three parts.
10136-8{_}13607{_}Now let the back be divided into two equal parts in the direction of the line from 1 to 2; then let the leg be taken off, as shown by the line 5 to 6, and the shoulder, as shown by the line 7 to 8.
10136-8{_}13608{_}This, in our opinion, is the best plan to carve a rabbit, although there are other modes which are preferred by some.
10136-8{_}13609{_}[Illustration: ROAST RABBIT.]
10136-8{_}13610{_}A roast rabbit is rather differently trussed from one that is meant to be boiled; but the carving is nearly similar, as will be seen by the cut.
10136-8{_}13611{_}The back should be divided into as many pieces as it will give, and the legs and shoulders can then be disengaged in the same manner as those of the boiled animal.
10136-8{_}13612{_}ROAST TURKEY.
10136-8{_}13613{_}[Illustration: ROAST TURKEY.]
10136-8{_}13614{_}1005.
10136-8{_}13615{_}A noble dish is a turkey, roast or boiled.
10136-8{_}13616{_}A Christmas dinner, with the middle classes of this empire, would scarcely be a Christmas dinner without its turkey; and we can hardly imagine an object of greater envy than is presented by a respected portly pater-familias carving, at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity, his own fat turkey, and carving it well.
10136-8{_}13617{_}The only art consists, as in the carving of a goose, in getting from the breast as many fine slices as possible; and all must have remarked the very great difference in the large number of people whom a good carver will find slices for, and the comparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving.
10136-8{_}13618{_}As we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose, the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from, 2 to 3, and then proceed upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone: this is not the usual plan, but, in practice, will be found the best.
10136-8{_}13619{_}The breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey, the legs being very seldom cut off and eaten at table: they are usually removed to the kitchen, where they are taken off, as here marked, to appear only in a form which seems to have a special attraction at a bachelor's supper-table,--we mean devilled: served in this way, they are especially liked and relished.
10136-8{_}13620{_}A boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted.
10136-8{_}13621{_}[Illustration]  CHAPTER XXII.
10136-8{_}13622{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GAME.
10136-8{_}13623{_}1006.
10136-8{_}13624{_}THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND has a maxim, that goods, in which no person can claim any property, belong, by his or her prerogative, to the king or queen.
10136-8{_}13625{_}Accordingly, those animals, those _ferae naturae_, which come under the denomination of game, are, in our laws, styled his or her majesty's, and may therefore, as a matter of course, be granted by the sovereign to another; in consequence of which another may prescribe to possess the same within a certain precinct or lordship.
10136-8{_}13626{_}From this circumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game within their respective liberties; and to protect these species of animals, the game laws were originated, and still remain in force.
10136-8{_}13627{_}There are innumerable acts of parliament inflicting penalties on persons who may illegally kill game, and some of them are very severe; but they cannot be said to answer their end, nor can it be expected that they ever will, whilst there are so many persons of great wealth who have not otherwise the means of procuring game, except by purchase, and who will have it.
10136-8{_}13628{_}These must necessarily encourage poaching, which, to a very large extent, must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their intended effects upon the rustic population.
10136-8{_}13629{_}1007.
10136-8{_}13630{_}THE OBJECT OF THESE LAWS, however, is not wholly confined to the restraining of the illegal sportsman.
10136-8{_}13631{_}Even qualified or privileged persons must not kill game at all seasons.
10136-8{_}13632{_}During the day, the hours allowed for sporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour after sunset; whilst the time of killing certain species is also restricted to certain seasons.
10136-8{_}13633{_}For example, the season for bustard-shooting is from December 1 to March 1; for grouse, or red grouse, from August 12 to December 10; heath-fowl, or black-game, from August 20 to December 20; partridges from September 1 to February 12; pheasants from October 1 to February 1; widgeons, wild ducks, wild geese, wild fowls, at any time but in June, July, August, and September.
10136-8{_}13634{_}Hares may be killed at any time of the year, under certain restrictions defined by an act of parliament of the 10th of George III.
10136-8{_}13635{_}1008.
10136-8{_}13636{_}THE EXERCISE OR DIVERSION OF PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS OF GAME is called hunting, which, to this day, is followed in the field and the forest, with gun and greyhound.
10136-8{_}13637{_}Birds, on the contrary, are not hunted, but shot in the air, or taken with nets and other devices, which is called fowling; or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey, which is called hawking, a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into desuetude in England, although, in some parts, showing signs of being revived.
10136-8{_}13638{_}1009.
10136-8{_}13639{_}IN PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS, such as deer, boars, and hares, properly termed hunting, mankind were, from the earliest ages, engaged.
10136-8{_}13640{_}It was the rudest and the most obvious manner of acquiring human support before the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced.
10136-8{_}13641{_}It is an employment, however, requiring both art and contrivance, as well as a certain fearlessness of character, combined with the power of considerable physical endurance.
10136-8{_}13642{_}Without these, success could not be very great; but, at best, the occupation is usually accompanied with rude and turbulent habits; and, when combined with these, it constitutes what is termed the savage state of man.
10136-8{_}13643{_}As culture advances, and as the soil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough or to the sustenance of the tamer or more domesticated animals, the range of the huntsman is proportionably limited; so that when a country has attained to a high state of cultivation, hunting becomes little else than an amusement of the opulent.
10136-8{_}13644{_}In the case of fur-bearing animals, however, it is somewhat different; for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with one of its most valuable materials of commerce.
10136-8{_}13645{_}1010.
10136-8{_}13646{_}THE THEMES WHICH FORM THE MINSTRELSY OF THE EARLIEST AGES, either relate to the spoils of the chase or the dangers of the battle-field.
10136-8{_}13647{_}Even the sacred writings introduce us to Nimrod, the first mighty hunter before the Lord, and tell us that Ishmael, in the solitudes of Arabia, became a skilful bow-man; and that David, when yet young, was not afraid to join in combat with the lion or the bear.
10136-8{_}13648{_}The Greek mythology teems with hunting exploits.
10136-8{_}13649{_}Hercules overthrows the Nemaean lion, the Erymanthean boar, and the hydra of Lerna; Diana descends to the earth, and pursues the stag; whilst Aesculapius, Nestor, Theseus, Ulysses, and Achilles are all followers of the chase.
10136-8{_}13650{_}Aristotle, sage as he was, advises young men to apply themselves early to it; and Plato finds in it something divine.
10136-8{_}13651{_}Horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the path of glory, and several of the heroes of Homer are its ardent votaries.
10136-8{_}13652{_}The Romans followed the hunting customs of the Greeks, and the ancient Britons were hunters before Julius Caesar invaded their shores.
10136-8{_}13653{_}1011.
10136-8{_}13654{_}ALTHOUGH THE ANCIENT BRITONS FOLLOWED HUNTING, however, they did not confine themselves solely to its pursuit.
10136-8{_}13655{_}They bred cattle and tilled the ground, and, to some extent, indicated the rudimentary state of a pastoral and agricultural life; but, in every social change, the sports of the field maintained their place.
10136-8{_}13656{_}After the expulsion of the Danes, and during the brief restoration of the Saxon monarchy, these were still followed: even Edward the Confessor, who would join in no other secular amusements, took the greatest delight, says William of Malmesbury, "to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game, and to cheer them with his voice."
10136-8{_}13657{_}1012.
10136-8{_}13658{_}NOR WAS EDWARD the only English sovereign who delighted in the pleasures of the chase.
10136-8{_}13659{_}William the Norman, and his two sons who succeeded him, were passionately fond of the sport, and greatly circumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the killing of game.
10136-8{_}13660{_}The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the king and his favourites; and in order that these umbrageous retreats might be made more extensive, whole villages were depopulated, places of worship levelled with the ground, and every means adopted that might give a sufficient amplitude of space, in accordance with the royal pleasure, for the beasts of the chase.
10136-8{_}13661{_}King John was likewise especially attached to the sports of the field; whilst Edward III.
10136-8{_}13662{_}was so enamoured of the exercise, that even during his absence at the wars in France, he took with him sixty couples of stag-hounds and as many hare-hounds, and every day amused himself either with hunting or hawking.
10136-8{_}13663{_}Great in wisdom as the Scotch Solomon, James I., conceited himself to be, he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting, hawking, and shooting.
10136-8{_}13664{_}Yea, it is oven asserted that his precious time was divided between hunting, the bottle, and his standish: to the first he gave his fair weather, to the second his dull, and to the third his cloudy.
10136-8{_}13665{_}From his days down to the present, the sports of the field have continued to hold their high reputation, not only for the promotion of health, but for helping to form that manliness of character which enters so largely into the composition of the sons of the British soil.
10136-8{_}13666{_}That it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt.
10136-8{_}13667{_}The late duke of Grafton, when hunting, was, on one occasion, thrown into a ditch.
10136-8{_}13668{_}A young curate, engaged in the same chase, cried out, "Lie still, my lord!"
10136-8{_}13669{_}leapt over him, and pursued his sport.
10136-8{_}13670{_}Such an apparent want of feeling might be expected to have been resented by the duke; but not so.
10136-8{_}13671{_}On his being helped up by his attendant, he said, "That man shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal: had he stopped to have given me his sympathy, I never would have given him anything."
10136-8{_}13672{_}Such was the manly sentiment of the duke, who delighted in the exemplification of a spirit similarly ardent as his own in the sport, and above the baseness of an assumed sorrow.
10136-8{_}13673{_}1013.
10136-8{_}13674{_}THAT HUNTING HAS IN MANY INSTANCES BEEN CARRIED TO AN EXCESS is well known, and the match given by the Prince Esterhazy, regent of Hungary, on the signing of the treaty of peace with France, is not the least extraordinary upon record.
10136-8{_}13675{_}On that occasion, there were killed 160 deer, 100 wild boars, 300 hares, and 80 foxes: this was the achievement of one day.
10136-8{_}13676{_}Enormous, however, as this slaughter may appear, it is greatly inferior to that made by the contemporary king of Naples on a hunting expedition.
10136-8{_}13677{_}That sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his command, and a longer period for the exercise of his talents; consequently, his sport, if it can so be called, was proportionably greater.
10136-8{_}13678{_}It was pursued during his journey to Vienna, in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia; when he killed 5 bears, 1,820 boars, 1,950 deer, 1,145 does, 1,625 roebucks, 11,121 rabbits, 13 wolves, 17 badgers, 16,354 hares, and 354 foxes.
10136-8{_}13679{_}In birds, during the same expedition, he killed 15,350 pheasants and 12,335 partridges.
10136-8{_}13680{_}Such an amount of destruction can hardly be called sport; it resembles more the indiscriminate slaughter of a battle-field, where the scientific engines of civilized warfare are brought to bear upon defenceless savages.
10136-8{_}13681{_}1014.
10136-8{_}13682{_}DEER AND HARES may be esteemed as the only four-footed animals now hunted in Britain for the table; and even those are not followed with the same ardour as they were wont to be.
10136-8{_}13683{_}Still, there is no country in the world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried to such an extent as in Great Britain, and where the pleasures of the chase are so well understood, and conducted on such purely scientific principles.
10136-8{_}13684{_}The Fox, of all "the beasts of the field," is now considered to afford the best sport.
10136-8{_}13685{_}For this, it is infinitely superior to the stag; for the real sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and found like other game which are pursued with hounds.
10136-8{_}13686{_}In the case of finding an outlying fallow-deer, which is unharboured, in this manner, great sport is frequently obtained; but this is now rarely to be met with in Britain.
10136-8{_}13687{_}In reference to hare-hunting, it is much followed in many parts of this and the sister island; but, by the true foxhunter, it is considered as a sport only fit to be pursued by women and old men.
10136-8{_}13688{_}Although it is less dangerous and exciting than the fox-chase, however, it has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which the other requires.
10136-8{_}13689{_}1015.
10136-8{_}13690{_}THE ART OF TAKING OR KILLING BIRDS is called "fowling," and is either practised as an amusement by persons of rank or property, or for a livelihood by persons who use nets and other apparatus.
10136-8{_}13691{_}When practised as an amusement, it principally consists of killing them with a light firearm called a "fowling-piece," and the sport is secured to those who pursue it by the game laws.
10136-8{_}13692{_}The other means by which birds are taken, consist in imitating their voices, or leading them, by other artifices, into situations where they become entrapped by nets, birdlime, or otherwise.
10136-8{_}13693{_}For taking large numbers of birds, the pipe or call is the most common means employed; and this is done during the months of September and October.
10136-8{_}13694{_}We will here briefly give a description of the _modus operandi_ pursued in this sport.
10136-8{_}13695{_}A thin wood is usually the spot chosen, and, under a tree at a little distance from the others, a cabin is erected, and there are only such branches left on the tree as are necessary for the placing of the birdlime, and which are covered with it.
10136-8{_}13696{_}Around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches, also covered with birdlime.
10136-8{_}13697{_}Having thus prepared all that is necessary, the birdcatcher places himself in the cabin, and, at sunrise and sunset, imitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance.
10136-8{_}13698{_}Supposing that the cry of the owl is imitated, immediately different kinds of birds will flock together at the cry of their common enemy, when, at every instant, they will be seen falling to the ground, their wings being of no use to them, from their having come in contact with the birdlime.
10136-8{_}13699{_}The cries of those which are thus situated now attract others, and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time.
10136-8{_}13700{_}If owls were themselves desired to be taken, it is only during the night that this can be done, by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse.
10136-8{_}13701{_}Larks, other birds, and water-fowl, are sometimes taken by nets; but to describe fully the manner in which this is done, would here occupy too much space.
10136-8{_}13702{_}1016.
10136-8{_}13703{_}FEATHERED GAME HAVE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL given gratification to the palate of man.
10136-8{_}13704{_}With the exception of birds of prey, and some other species, Moses permitted his people to eat them; and the Egyptians made offerings to their priests of their most delicate birds.
10136-8{_}13705{_}The ancient Greeks commenced their repasts with little roasted birds; and feathered game, amongst the Romans, was served as the second course.
10136-8{_}13706{_}Indeed, several of the ancient _gourmands_ of the "imperial city" were so fond of game, that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and pheasants.
10136-8{_}13707{_}"Some modern nations, the French among others," says Monsieur Soyer, "formerly ate the heron, crane, crow, stork, swan, cormorant, and bittern.
10136-8{_}13708{_}The first three especially were highly esteemed; and Laillevant, cook of Charles VII., teaches us how to prepare these meagre, tough birds.
10136-8{_}13709{_}Belon says, that in spite of its revolting taste when unaccustomed to it, the bittern is, however, among the delicious treats of the French.
10136-8{_}13710{_}This writer also asserts, that a falcon or a vulture, either roasted or boiled, is excellent eating; and that if one of these birds happened to kill itself in flying after game, the falconer instantly cooked it.
10136-8{_}13711{_}Lebaut calls the heron a royal viand."
10136-8{_}13712{_}1017.
10136-8{_}13713{_}THE HERON WAS HUNTED BY THE HAWK, and the sport of hawking is usually placed at the head of those amusements that can only be practised in the country.
10136-8{_}13714{_}This precedency it probably obtained from its being a pastime to generally followed by the nobility, not in Great Britain only, but likewise on the continent.
10136-8{_}13715{_}In former times, persons of high rank rarely appeared in public without their dogs and their hawks: the latter they carried with them when they journeyed from one country to another, and sometimes even took them to battle with them, and would not part with them when taken prisoners, even to obtain their own liberty.
10136-8{_}13716{_}Such birds were esteemed as the ensigns of nobility, and no action was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank than that of giving up his hawk.
10136-8{_}13717{_}We have already alluded to the hunting propensities of our own Edward III., and we may also allude to his being equally addicted to hawking.
10136-8{_}13718{_}According to Froissart, when this sovereign invaded France, he took with him thirty falconers on horseback, who had charge of his hawks, and every day, as his royal fancy inclined him, he either hunted, or went to the river for the purpose of hawking.
10136-8{_}13719{_}In the great and powerful, the pursuit of game as a sport is allowable, but in those who have to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, it is to be condemned.
10136-8{_}13720{_}In Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy" we find a humorous story, told by Poggius, the Florentine, who reprobates this folly in such persons.
10136-8{_}13721{_}It is this.
10136-8{_}13722{_}A physician of Milan, that cured madmen, had a pit of water in his house, in which he kept his patients, some up to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the chin, _pro modo insaniae_, as they were more or less affected.
10136-8{_}13723{_}One of them by chance, that was well recovered, stood in the door, and seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk on his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him, would needs know to what use all this preparation served.
10136-8{_}13724{_}He made answer, To kill certain fowl.
10136-8{_}13725{_}The patient demanded again, what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year?
10136-8{_}13726{_}He replied, Five or ten crowns; and when he urged him further, what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him in, he told him four hundred crowns.
10136-8{_}13727{_}With that the patient bade him begone, as he loved his life and welfare; "for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the pit, amongst the madmen, up to the chin."
10136-8{_}13728{_}Thus reproving the madness of such men as will spend themselves in those vain sports, to the neglect of their business and necessary affairs.
10136-8{_}13729{_}1018.
10136-8{_}13730{_}AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS is, at least to limit, if not entirely to suppress, such sports as we have here been treating of, much of the romance of country life has passed away.
10136-8{_}13731{_}This is more especially the case with falconry, which had its origin about the middle of the fourth century, although, lately, some attempts have been rather successfully made to institute a revival of the "gentle art" of hawking.
10136-8{_}13732{_}Julius Firmicus, who lived about that time, is, so far as we can find, the first Latin author who speaks of falconers, and the art of teaching one species of birds to fly after and catch others.
10136-8{_}13733{_}The occupation of these functionaries has now, however, all but ceased.
10136-8{_}13734{_}New and nobler efforts characterize the aims of mankind in the development of their civilization, and the sports of the field have, to a large extent, been superseded by other exercises, it may be less healthful and invigorating, but certainly more elegant, intellectual, and humanizing.

10136-8{_}13737{_}ROAST BLACK-COCK.
10136-8{_}13738{_}1019.
10136-8{_}13739{_}INGREDIENTS.--Black-cock, butter, toast.
10136-8{_}13740{_}[Illustration: ROAST BLACK-COCK.]
10136-8{_}13741{_}_Mode_.--Let these birds hang for a few days, or they will be tough and tasteless, if not well kept.
10136-8{_}13742{_}Pluck and draw them, and wipe the insides and outsides with a damp cloth, as washing spoils the flavour.
10136-8{_}13743{_}Cut off the heads, and truss them, the same as a roast fowl, cutting off the toes, and scalding and peeling the feet.
10136-8{_}13744{_}Trussing them with the head on, as shown in the engraving, is still practised by many cooks, but the former method is now considered the best.
10136-8{_}13745{_}Put them down to a brisk fire, well baste them with butter, and serve with a piece of toast under, and a good gravy and bread sauce.
10136-8{_}13746{_}After trussing, some cooks cover the breast with vine-leaves and slices of bacon, and then roast them.
10136-8{_}13747{_}They should be served in the same manner and with the same accompaniments as with the plainly-roasted birds.
10136-8{_}13748{_}_Time_.--45 to 50 minutes.
10136-8{_}13749{_}_Average cost_, from 5s.
10136-8{_}13750{_}to 6s.
10136-8{_}13751{_}the brace; but seldom bought.
10136-8{_}13752{_}_Sufficient_,--2 or 3 for a dish.
10136-8{_}13753{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of August to the end of December.
10136-8{_}13754{_}[Illustration: THE BLACK-COCK.]
10136-8{_}13755{_}THE BLACK-COCK, HEATH-COCK, MOOR-FOWL, OR HEATH-POULT.--This     bird sometimes weighs as much as four pounds, and the hen about     two.
10136-8{_}13756{_}It is at present confined to the more northern parts of     Britain, culture and extending population having united in     driving it into more desolate regions, except, perhaps, in a few     of the more wild and less-frequented portions of England.
10136-8{_}13757{_}It may     still be found in the New Forest, in Hampshire, Dartmoor, and     Sedgmoor, in Devonshire, and among the hills of Somersetshire,     contiguous to the latter.
10136-8{_}13758{_}It may also be found in Staffordshire,     in North Wales, and again in the north of England; but nowhere     so plentiful as in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland.
10136-8{_}13759{_}The     males are hardly distinguishable from the females until they are     about half-grown, when the black feathers begin to appear, first     about the sides and breast.
10136-8{_}13760{_}Their food consists of the tops of     birch and heath, except when the mountain berries are ripe, at     which period they eagerly and even voraciously pick the     bilberries and cranberries from the bushes.
10136-8{_}13761{_}Large numbers of     these birds are found in Norway, almost rivalling the turkey in     point of size.
10136-8{_}13762{_}Some of them have begun to be imported into     London, where they are vended in the shops; but the flavour of     their flesh is not equal to that of the Scotch bird.
10136-8{_}13763{_}HASHED WILD DUCK.
10136-8{_}13764{_}1020.
10136-8{_}13765{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast wild duck, 1 pint of good brown gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 glass of claret, salt, cayenne, and mixed spices to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon or Seville orange-juice.
10136-8{_}13766{_}_Mode_.--Cut the remains of the duck into neat joints, put them into a stewpan, with all the above ingredients; let them get gradually hot by the side of the fire, and occasionally stir the contents; when on the point of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}13767{_}_Time_.--About 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}13768{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February.
10136-8{_}13769{_}RAGOUT OF WILD DUCK.
10136-8{_}13770{_}1021.
10136-8{_}13771{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 wild ducks, 4 shalots, 1 pint of stock No.
10136-8{_}13772{_}105, 1 glass of port wine, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}13773{_}of butter, a little flour, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}13774{_}_Mode_.--Ducks that have been dressed and left from the preceding day will answer for this dish.
10136-8{_}13775{_}Cut them into joints, reserve the legs, wings, and breasts until wanted; put the trimmings into a stewpan with the shalots and stock, and let them simmer for about 1/2 hour, and strain the gravy.
10136-8{_}13776{_}Put the butter into a stewpan; when melted, dredge in a little flour, and pour in the gravy made from the bones; give it one boil, and strain it again; add the wine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; lay in the pieces of duck, and let the whole gradually warm through, but do not allow it to boil, or the duck will be hard.
10136-8{_}13777{_}The gravy should not be too thick, and should be very highly seasoned.
10136-8{_}13778{_}The squeeze of a Seville orange is a great improvement to this dish.
10136-8{_}13779{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to make the gravy; 1/4 hour for the duck gradually to warm through.
10136-8{_}13780{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February.
10136-8{_}13781{_}ROAST WILD DUCK.
10136-8{_}13782{_}1022.
10136-8{_}13783{_}INGREDIENTS.--Wild duck, flour, butter.
10136-8{_}13784{_}[Illustration: ROAST WILD DUCK.]
10136-8{_}13785{_}_Mode_.--Carefully pluck and draw them; Cut off the heads close to the necks, leaving sufficient skin to turn over, and do not cut off the feet; some twist each leg at the knuckle, and rest the claws on each side of the breast; others truss them as shown in our Illustration.
10136-8{_}13786{_}Roast the birds before a quick fire, and, when they are first put down, let them remain for 5 minutes without basting (this will keep the gravy in); afterwards baste plentifully with butter, and a few minutes before serving dredge them lightly with flour; baste well, and send them to table nicely frothed, and full of gravy.
10136-8{_}13787{_}If overdone, the birds will lose their flavour.
10136-8{_}13788{_}Serve with a good gravy in the dish, or orange gravy, No.
10136-8{_}13789{_}488; and send to table with them a cut lemon.
10136-8{_}13790{_}To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, baste them for a few minutes with hot water to which have been added an onion and a little salt; then take away the pan, and baste with butter.--See coloured plate, G1.
10136-8{_}13791{_}_Time_.--When liked underdressed, 20 to 25 minutes; well done, 25 to 35 minutes.
10136-8{_}13792{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}13793{_}to 5s.
10136-8{_}13794{_}the couple.
10136-8{_}13795{_}_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.
10136-8{_}13796{_}_Seasonable_ from November to February.
10136-8{_}13797{_}[Illustration: THE WILD DUCK.]
10136-8{_}13798{_}THE WILD DUCK.--The male of the wild dock is called a mallard;     and the young ones are called flappers.
10136-8{_}13799{_}The time to try to find     a brood of these is about the month of July, among the rushes of     the deepest and most retired parts of some brook or stream,     where, if the old bird is sprung, it may be taken as a certainty     that its brood is not far off.
10136-8{_}13800{_}When once found, flappers are     easily killed, as they attain their full growth before their     wings are fledged.
10136-8{_}13801{_}Consequently, the sport is more like hunting     water-rats than shooting birds.
10136-8{_}13802{_}When the flappers take wing,     they assume the name of wild ducks, and about the month of     August repair to the corn-fields, where they remain until they     are disturbed by the harvest-people.
10136-8{_}13803{_}They then frequent the     rivers pretty early in the evening, and give excellent sport to     those who have patience to wait for them.
10136-8{_}13804{_}In order to know a     wild duck, it is necessary only to look at the claws, which     should be black.
10136-8{_}13805{_}HASHED GAME (Cold Meat Cookery).
10136-8{_}13806{_}1023.
10136-8{_}13807{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold game, 1 onion stuck with 3 cloves, a few whole peppers, a strip of lemon-peel, salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 pint of water or weak stock.
10136-8{_}13808{_}_Mode_.--Cut the remains of cold game into joints, reserve the best pieces, and the inferior ones and trimmings put into a stewpan with the onion, pepper, lemon-peel, salt, and water or weak stock; stew these for about an hour, and strain the gravy; thicken it with butter and flour; add the wine, lemon-juice, and ketchup; lay in the pieces of game, and let them gradually warm through by the side of the fire; do not allow it to boil, or the game will be hard.
10136-8{_}13809{_}When on the point of simmering, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}13810{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}13811{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March.
10136-8{_}13812{_}_Note_.--Any kind of game may be hashed by the above recipe, and the flavour may be varied by adding flavoured vinegars, curvy powder, &c.; but we cannot recommend these latter ingredients, as a dish of game should really have a gamy taste; and if too many sauces, essences, &c., are added to the gravy, they quite overpower and destroy the flavour the dish should possess.
10136-8{_}13813{_}GROUSE PIE.
10136-8{_}13814{_}1024.
10136-8{_}13815{_}INGREDIENTS.--Grouse; cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 lb.
10136-8{_}13816{_}of rump-steak, 1/2 pint of well-seasoned broth, puff paste.
10136-8{_}13817{_}_Mode_.--Line the bottom of a pie-dish with the rump-steak cut into neat pieces, and, should the grouse be large, cut them into joints; but, if small, they may be laid in the pie whole; season highly with salt, cayenne, and black pepper; pour in the broth, and cover with a puff paste; brush the crust over with the yolk of an egg, and bake from 3/4 to 1 hour.
10136-8{_}13818{_}If the grouse is cut into joints, the backbones and trimmings will make the gravy, by stewing them with an onion, a little sherry, a bunch of herbs, and a blade of mace: this should be poured in after the pie is baked.
10136-8{_}13819{_}_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour.
10136-8{_}13820{_}_Average cost_, exclusive of the grouse, which are seldom bought, 1s.
10136-8{_}13821{_}9d.
10136-8{_}13822{_}_Seasonable_ from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.
10136-8{_}13823{_}ROAST GROUSE.
10136-8{_}13824{_}[Illustration: ROAST GROUSE.]
10136-8{_}13825{_}1025.
10136-8{_}13826{_}INGREDIENTS.--Grouse, butter, a thick slice of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}13827{_}_Mode_.--Let the birds hang as long as possible; pluck and draw them; wipe, but do not wash them, inside and out, and truss them without the head, the same as for a roast fowl.
10136-8{_}13828{_}Many persons still continue to truss them with the head under the wing, but the former is now considered the most approved method.
10136-8{_}13829{_}Put them down to a sharp clear fire; keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking, and serve them on a buttered toast, soaked in the dripping-pan, with a little melted butter poured over them, or with bread-sauce and gravy.--See coloured plate, L1.
10136-8{_}13830{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour; if liked very thoroughly done, 35 minutes.
10136-8{_}13831{_}_Average cost_, 2s.

10136-8{_}13837{_}[Illustration: RED GROUSE.]
10136-8{_}13838{_}GROUSE.--These birds are divided into wood grouse, black grouse,     red grouse, and white grouse.
10136-8{_}13839{_}The wood grouse is further     distinguished as the cock of the wood, or capercalzie, and is as     large as the turkey, being about two feet nine inches in length,     and weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds.
10136-8{_}13840{_}The female is     considerably less than the male, and, in the colour of her     feathers, differs widely from the other.
10136-8{_}13841{_}This beautiful species     is found principally in lofty, mountainous regions, and is very     rare in Great Britain; but in the pine forests of Russia,     Sweden, and other northern countries, it is very common.
10136-8{_}13842{_}In     these it has its habitat, feeding on the cones of the trees, and     the fruits of various kinds of plants, especially the berry of     the jumper.
10136-8{_}13843{_}Black grouse is also distinguished as black-game, or     the black-cock.
10136-8{_}13844{_}It is not larger than the common hen, and weighs     only about four pounds.
10136-8{_}13845{_}The female is about one-third less than     the male, and also differs considerably from him in point of     colour.
10136-8{_}13846{_}Like the former, they are found chiefly in high     situations, and are common in Russia, Siberia, and other     northern countries.
10136-8{_}13847{_}They are also found in the northern parts of     Great Britain, feeding in winter on the various berries and     fruits belonging to mountainous countries, and, in summer,     frequently descending to the lower lands, to feed upon corn.
10136-8{_}13848{_}The     red grouse, gorcock, or moor-cock, weighs about nineteen ounces,     and the female somewhat less.
10136-8{_}13849{_}In the wild heathy tracts of the     northern counties of England it is plentiful, also in Wales and     the Highlands of Scotland.
10136-8{_}13850{_}Mr. Pennant considered it peculiar to     Britain, those found in the mountainous parts of Spain, France,     and Italy, being only varieties of the same bird.
10136-8{_}13851{_}White grouse,     white game, or ptarmigan, is nearly the same size as the red     grouse, and is found in lofty situations, where it supports     itself in the severest weather.
10136-8{_}13852{_}It is to be met with in most of     the northern countries of Europe, and appears even in Greenland.
10136-8{_}13853{_}In the Hebrides, Orkneys, and the Highlands of Scotland, it is     also found; and sometimes, though rarely, among the fells of     Northumberland and Cumberland.
10136-8{_}13854{_}In winter they fly in flocks, and     are so little familiar with the sight of man, that they are     easily shot, and even snared.
10136-8{_}13855{_}They feed on the wild produce of     the hills, which sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but     not unpalatable taste.
10136-8{_}13856{_}According to Buffon, it is dark-coloured,     and somewhat flavoured like the hare.
10136-8{_}13857{_}GROUSE SALAD.
10136-8{_}13858{_}(_Soyer's Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}13859{_}1026.
10136-8{_}13860{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, butter, fresh salad, 1 or 2 grouse; for the sauce, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}13861{_}of salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar, 1 gill of cream.
10136-8{_}13862{_}_Mode_.--Boil the eggs hard, shell them, throw them into cold water cut a thin slice off the bottom to facilitate the proper placing of them in the dish, cut each one into four lengthwise, and make a very thin flat border of butter, about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is to be served on; fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the yolk outside, or the yolk and white alternately; lay in the centre a fresh salad of whatever is in season, and, having previously roasted the grouse rather underdone, cut it into eight or ten pieces, and prepare the sauce as follows:--Put the shalots into a basin, with the sugar, the yolk of an egg, the parsley, and salt, and mix in by degrees the oil and vinegar; when these ingredients are well mixed, put the sauce on ice or in a cool place.
10136-8{_}13863{_}When ready to serve, whip the cream rather thick, which lightly mix with it; then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad, sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse, pour the rest of the sauce over, and serve.
10136-8{_}13864{_}The eggs may be ornamented with a little dot of radishes or beetroot on the point.
10136-8{_}13865{_}Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed between, or cut gherkins in slices, and a border of them laid round.
10136-8{_}13866{_}Tarragon or chervil-leaves are also a pretty addition.
10136-8{_}13867{_}The remains of cold black-game, pheasant, or partridge may be used in the above manner, and will make a very delicate dish.

10136-8{_}13870{_}_Seasonable_ from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.
10136-8{_}13871{_}[Illustration: THE CAPERCALZIE.]
10136-8{_}13872{_}THE CAPERCALZIE.--This bird was to be met with formerly both in     Ireland and Scotland, but is now extinct.
10136-8{_}13873{_}The male lives     separate from the females, except in the breeding season.
10136-8{_}13874{_}Its     manners and habits are very like those of black grouse, except     that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine, on the     tender shoots of which it feeds.
10136-8{_}13875{_}It is by no means uncommon in     the woods of Norway, whence we received it.
10136-8{_}13876{_}It is also found     abundant in Russia, Siberia, Italy, and in some portions of the     Alps.
10136-8{_}13877{_}It was, in 1760, last seen in Scotland, in the woods of     Strathglass.
10136-8{_}13878{_}Recent attempts have been made to re-introduce it     into that country, but without success; principally owing, as we     should imagine, to the want of sufficient food suitable for its     sustenance.
10136-8{_}13879{_}GROUSE.--Under this general term are included several species of     game birds, called black, red, woodland, and white grouse.
10136-8{_}13880{_}The     black is larger than the red (see No.
10136-8{_}13881{_}1025), and is not so     common, and therefore held in higher estimation.
10136-8{_}13882{_}The red,     however, is a bird of exquisite flavour, and is a native of the     mountainous districts of Scotland and the north of England.
10136-8{_}13883{_}It     feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst     them: its colour is a rich chestnut, striped with black.
10136-8{_}13884{_}The     woodland, or cock of the wood, is the largest among the bird     tribes which pass under the denomination of game.
10136-8{_}13885{_}It is smaller     than the turkey, and was originally common in our mountains; but     it is now to be found only in the mountains of Scotland, though     it still abounds in the north of Europe, Germany, and in the     Alps.
10136-8{_}13886{_}It is esteemed as delicious eating, and its plumage is     extremely beautiful.
10136-8{_}13887{_}The white grouse, or ptarmigan, is not a     plentiful bird in Britain; but it is still found in the islands,     and weighs about half a pound.
10136-8{_}13888{_}The London market is supplied by     Norway and Scotland; those from the former country being     esteemed the best.
10136-8{_}13889{_}When young, it is held in high estimation,     being considered as little different from common grouse.
10136-8{_}13890{_}ROAST HARE.
10136-8{_}13891{_}1027.
10136-8{_}13892{_}INGREDIENTS.--Hare, forcemeat No.
10136-8{_}13893{_}417, a little milk, butter.
10136-8{_}13894{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose a young hare; which may be known by its smooth and sharp claws, and by the cleft in the lip not being much spread.
10136-8{_}13895{_}To be eaten in perfection, it must hang for some time; and, if properly taken care of, it may be kept for several days.
10136-8{_}13896{_}It is better to hang without being paunched; but should it be previously emptied, wipe the inside every day, and sprinkle over it a little pepper and ginger, to prevent the musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing.
10136-8{_}13897{_}After it is skinned, wash it well, and soak for an hour in warm water to draw out the blood; if old, let it lie in vinegar for a short time, but wash it well afterwards in several waters.
10136-8{_}13898{_}Make a forcemeat by recipe No.
10136-8{_}13899{_}417, wipe the hare dry, fill the belly with it, and sew it up.
10136-8{_}13900{_}Bring the hind and fore legs close to the body towards the head, run a skewer through each, fix the head between the shoulders by means of another skewer, and be careful to leave the ears on.
10136-8{_}13901{_}Pat a string round the body from skewer to skewer, and tie it above the back.
10136-8{_}13902{_}[Illustration: ROAST HARE.]
10136-8{_}13903{_}_Mode_.--The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is first laid down, or the outside will become dry and hard before the inside is done.
10136-8{_}13904{_}Baste it well with milk for a short time, and afterwards with butter; and particular attention must be paid to the basting, so as to preserve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive.
10136-8{_}13905{_}When it is almost roasted enough, flour the hare, and baste well with butter.
10136-8{_}13906{_}When nicely frothed, dish it, remove the skewers, and send it to table with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same.
10136-8{_}13907{_}Red-currant jelly must also not be forgotten, as this is an indispensable accompaniment to roast hare.
10136-8{_}13908{_}For economy, good beef dripping may be substituted for the milk and butter to baste with; but the basting, as we have before stated, must be continued without intermission.
10136-8{_}13909{_}If the liver is good, it maybe parboiled, minced, and mixed with the stuffing; but it should not be used unless quite fresh.--See coloured plate, E1.
10136-8{_}13910{_}_Time_.--A middling-sized hare, 1-1/4 hour; a large hare, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

10136-8{_}13912{_}to 6s.
10136-8{_}13913{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}13914{_}_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.
10136-8{_}13915{_}THE HARE.--This little animal is found generally distributed over Europe, and, indeed, in most parts of the northern world.
10136-8{_}13916{_}Its extreme timidity is the endowment which Providence has bestowed upon it as a means of defence; it is therefore attentive to every sound, and is supplied with ears both long and tubular, with which it can hear with great acuteness.
10136-8{_}13917{_}Its eyes, also, are so constructed, and placed so prominent in its head, that it can see both before and behind it.
10136-8{_}13918{_}It lives entirely upon vegetables, but its flesh is considered dry, notwithstanding that it is deemed, in many respects, superior to that of the rabbit, being more savoury, and of a much higher flavour.
10136-8{_}13919{_}Its general time of feeding is the evening; but during the day, if not disturbed, it adheres closely to its _form_.
10136-8{_}13920{_}[Illustration: THE HARE.]
10136-8{_}13921{_}POTTED HARE (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).

10136-8{_}13924{_}_Mode_.--Skin, empty, and wash the hare; cut it down the middle, and put it into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon under and over it; add the remaining ingredients, and stew very gently until the hare is tender, and the flesh will separate easily from the bones.
10136-8{_}13925{_}When done enough, take it up, remove the bones, and pound the meat, _with the bacon_, in a mortar, until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste.
10136-8{_}13926{_}Should it not be sufficiently seasoned, add a little cayenne, salt, and pounded mace, but be careful that these are well mixed with the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}13927{_}Press the meat into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep in a dry place.
10136-8{_}13928{_}The liquor that the hare was stewed in, should be saved for hashes, soups, &c. &c.
10136-8{_}13929{_}_Time_.--About 21/2 hours to stew the hare.

10136-8{_}13948{_}(_Very Good_.)
10136-8{_}13949{_}1031.
10136-8{_}13950{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, 1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}13951{_}of gravy beef, 1/2 lb.

10136-8{_}13967{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions, each stuck with 3 cloves, 6 whole allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of black pepper, a strip of lemon-peel, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 1/4 pint of port wine.
10136-8{_}13968{_}_Mode._--Wash the hare nicely, cut it up into joints (not too large), and flour and brown them as in the preceding recipe; then put them into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, cloves, allspice, pepper, and lemon-peel; cover with hot water, and when it boils, carefully remove all the scum, and let it simmer gently till tender, which will be in about 1-3/4 hour, or longer, should the hare be very old.
10136-8{_}13969{_}Take out the pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, add the ketchup and port wine, let it boil for about 10 minutes, strain it through a sieve over the hare, and serve.
10136-8{_}13970{_}A few fried forcemeat balls should be added at the moment of serving, or instead of frying them, they may be stewed in the gravy, about 10 minutes before the hare is wanted for table.
10136-8{_}13971{_}Do not omit to serve red-currant jelly with it.
10136-8{_}13972{_}_Time_.--Altogether 2 hours.

10136-8{_}13989{_}[Illustration: THE LANDRAIL.]
10136-8{_}13990{_}THE LANDRAIL, OR CORN-CRAKE.--This bird is migratory in its     habits, yet from its formation, it seems ill adapted for long     aërial passages, its wings being short, and placed so forward     out of the centre of gravity, that it flies in an extremely     heavy and embarrassed manner, and with its legs hanging down.
10136-8{_}13991{_}When it alights, it can hardly be sprung a second time, as it     runs very fast, and seems to depend for its safety more on the     swiftness of its feet than the celerity of its wings.
10136-8{_}13992{_}It makes     its appearance in England about the same time as the quail, that     is, in the months of April and May, and frequents the same     places.
10136-8{_}13993{_}Its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes     long enough to shelter it, and it continues to be heard until     the grass is cut.
10136-8{_}13994{_}The bird, however, is seldom seen, for it     constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage,     and runs so nimbly through it, doubling and winding in every     direction, that it is difficult to get near it.
10136-8{_}13995{_}It leaves this     island before the winter, and repairs to other countries in     search of its food, which principally consists of slugs, large     numbers of which it destroys.
10136-8{_}13996{_}It is very common in Ireland, and,     whilst migrating to this country, is seen in great numbers in     the island of Anglesea.
10136-8{_}13997{_}On its first arrival in England, it is     so lean as scarcely to weigh above five or six ounces; before     its departure, however, it has been known to exceed eight     ounces, and is then most delicious eating.

10136-8{_}14002{_}Roast them before a clear fire, and keep them well basted all the time they are cooking.
10136-8{_}14003{_}A few minutes before serving, dredge them lightly with flour, and froth them nicely.

10136-8{_}14048{_}SALMI DE PERDRIX, or HASHED PARTRIDGES.
10136-8{_}14049{_}1038.
10136-8{_}14050{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 young partridges, 3 shalots, a slice of lean ham, 1 carrot, 3 or 4 mushrooms, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 cloves, 6 whole peppers, 3/4 pint of stock, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira, a small lump of sugar.
10136-8{_}14051{_}_Mode_.--After the partridges are plucked and drawn, roast them rather underdone, and cover them with paper, as they should not be browned; cut them into joints, take off the skin from the wings, legs, and breasts; put these into a stewpan, cover them up, and set by until the gravy is ready.
10136-8{_}14052{_}Cut a slice of ham into small pieces, and put them, with the carrots sliced, the shalots, mushrooms, herbs, cloves, and pepper, into a stewpan; fry them lightly in a little butter, pour in the stock, add the bones and trimming from the partridges, and simmer for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}14053{_}Strain the gravy, let it cool, and skim off every particle of fat; put it to the legs, wings, and breasts, add a glass of sherry or Madeira and a small lump of sugar, let all gradually warm through by the side of the fire, and when on the point of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with croûtons.
10136-8{_}14054{_}The remains of roast partridge answer very well dressed in this way, although not so good as when the birds are in the first instance only half-roasted.
10136-8{_}14055{_}This recipe is equally suitable for pheasants, moor-game, &c.; but care must be taken always to skin the joints.
10136-8{_}14056{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.
10136-8{_}14057{_}_Sufficient_.--2 or 3 partridges for an entrée.
10136-8{_}14058{_}_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.
10136-8{_}14059{_}ROAST PARTRIDGE.
10136-8{_}14060{_}1039.
10136-8{_}14061{_}INGREDIENTS.--Partridge; butter.
10136-8{_}14062{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose young birds, with dark-coloured bills and yellowish legs, and let them hang a few days, or there will be no flavour to the flesh, nor will it be tender.
10136-8{_}14063{_}The time they should be kept, entirely depends on the taste of those for whom they are intended, as what some persons would consider delicious, would be to others disgusting and offensive.
10136-8{_}14064{_}They may be trussed with or without the head, the latter mode being now considered the most fashionable.
10136-8{_}14065{_}Pluck, draw, and wipe the partridge carefully inside and out; cut off the head, leaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer back; bring the legs close to the breast, between it and the side-bones, and pass a skewer through the pinions and the thick part of the thighs.
10136-8{_}14066{_}When the head is left on, it should be brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer.
10136-8{_}14067{_}[Illustration: ROAST PARTRIDGE.]
10136-8{_}14068{_}_Mode_.--When the bird is firmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a nice bright fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before serving, flour and froth it well.
10136-8{_}14069{_}Dish it, and serve with gravy and bread sauce, and send to table hot and quickly.
10136-8{_}14070{_}A little of the gravy should be poured over the bird.--See coloured plate, D1.

10136-8{_}14078{_}[Illustration: PARTRIDGES.]
10136-8{_}14079{_}THE PARTRIDGE.--This bird is to be found in nearly all the     temperate countries of Europe, but is most abundant in the     Ukraine, although it is unable to bear the extremes of climate,     whether hot or cold.
10136-8{_}14080{_}It was formerly very common in France, and     is considered a table luxury in England.
10136-8{_}14081{_}The instinct of this     bird is frequently exemplified in a remarkable manner, for the     preservation of its young.
10136-8{_}14082{_}"I have seen it often," says a very     celebrated writer, and an accurate observer of nature, "and once     in particular, I saw an extraordinary instance of an old bird's     solicitude to save its brood.
10136-8{_}14083{_}As I was hunting with a young     pointer, the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges; the     old bird cried, fluttered, and ran tumbling along just before     the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable     distance, when she took wing, and flew still further off, but     not out of the field; on this the dog returned to me, near the     place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass, which the     old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us, settled     just before the dog's nose again, and by rolling and tumbling     about, drew off his attention from her young, and thus preserved     her brood a second time.
10136-8{_}14084{_}I have also seen, when a kite has been     hovering over a covey of young partridges, the old birds fly up     at the bird of prey, screaming and fighting with all their might     to preserve their brood."
10136-8{_}14085{_}Partridges should be chosen young; if     old, they are valueless.
10136-8{_}14086{_}The young ones are generally known by     their yellow legs and dark-coloured bills.
10136-8{_}14087{_}PHEASANT CUTLETS.
10136-8{_}14088{_}1040.
10136-8{_}14089{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 pheasants, egg and bread crumbs, cayenne and salt to taste, brown gravy.
10136-8{_}14090{_}_Mode_.--Procure 3 young pheasants that have been hung a few days; pluck, draw, and wipe them inside; cut them into joints; remove the bones from the best of these; and the backbones, trimmings, &c., put into a stewpan, with a little stock, herbs, vegetables, seasoning, &c., to make the gravy.
10136-8{_}14091{_}Flatten and trim the cutlets of a good shape, egg and bread crumb them, broil them over a clear fire, pile them high in the dish, and pour under them the gravy made from the bones, which should be strained, flavoured, and thickened.
10136-8{_}14092{_}One of the small bones should be stuck on the point of each cutlet.
10136-8{_}14093{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}14094{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}14095{_}6d.

10136-8{_}14099{_}_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.
10136-8{_}14100{_}ROAST PHEASANT.
10136-8{_}14101{_}1041.
10136-8{_}14102{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pheasant, flour, butter.
10136-8{_}14103{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Old pheasants may be known by the length and sharpness of their spurs; in young ones they are short and blunt.
10136-8{_}14104{_}The cock bird is generally reckoned the best, except when the hen is with egg.
10136-8{_}14105{_}They should hang some time before they are dressed, as, if they are cooked fresh, the flesh will be exceedingly dry and tasteless.
10136-8{_}14106{_}After the bird is plucked and drawn, wipe the inside with a damp cloth, and truss it in the same manner as partridge, No.
10136-8{_}14107{_}1039.
10136-8{_}14108{_}If the head is left on, as shown in the engraving, bring it round under the wing, and fix it on to the point of the skewer.
10136-8{_}14109{_}[Illustration: ROAST PHEASANT.]
10136-8{_}14110{_}_Mode_.--Roast it before a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and flour and froth it nicely.
10136-8{_}14111{_}Serve with brown gravy, a little of which should be poured round the bird, and a tureen of bread sauce.
10136-8{_}14112{_}2 or 3 of the pheasant's best tail-feathers are sometimes stuck in the tail as an ornament; but the fashion is not much to be commended.--See coloured plate, F1.
10136-8{_}14113{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 1 hour, according to the size.
10136-8{_}14114{_}_Average cost_, 2s.

10136-8{_}14119{_}_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.
10136-8{_}14120{_}[Illustration: THE PHEASANT.]
10136-8{_}14121{_}THE PHEASANT.--This beautiful bird is said to have been     discovered by the Argonauts on the banks of the Phasis, near     Mount Ararat, in their expedition to Colchis.
10136-8{_}14122{_}It is common,     however, in almost all the southern parts of the European     continent, and has been long naturalized in the warmest and most     woody counties of England.
10136-8{_}14123{_}It is very common in France; indeed,     so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers.
10136-8{_}14124{_}Although     it has been domesticated, this is not easily accomplished, nor     is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state.
10136-8{_}14125{_}Mr.     Ude says--"It is not often that pheasants are met with     possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long     keeping, as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept     as long as they are in other countries.
10136-8{_}14126{_}The hens, in general,     are the most delicate.
10136-8{_}14127{_}The cocks show their age by their spurs.
10136-8{_}14128{_}They are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from     the bill, which is commonly six days or a week after they have     been killed.
10136-8{_}14129{_}The flesh is white, tender, and has a good flavour,     if you keep it long enough; if not, it is not much different     from that of a common fowl or hen."
10136-8{_}14130{_}BRILLAT SAVARIN'S RECIPE FOR ROAST PHEASANT, a la Sainte Alliance.
10136-8{_}14131{_}1042.
10136-8{_}14132{_}When the pheasant is in good condition to be cooked (_see_ No.
10136-8{_}14133{_}1041), it should be plucked, and not before.
10136-8{_}14134{_}The bird should then be stuffed in the following manner:--Take two snipes, and draw them, putting the bodies on one plate, and the livers, &c., on another.
10136-8{_}14135{_}Take off the flesh, and mince it finely with a little beef, lard, a few truffles, pepper and salt to taste, and stuff the pheasant carefully with this.
10136-8{_}14136{_}Cut a slice of bread, larger considerably than the bird, and cover it with the liver, &c., and a few truffles: an anchovy and a little fresh butter added to these will do no harm.
10136-8{_}14137{_}Put the bread, &c., into the dripping-pan, and, when the bird is roasted, place it on the preparation, and surround it with Florida oranges.
10136-8{_}14138{_}Do not be uneasy, Savarin adds, about your dinner; for a pheasant served in this way is fit for beings better than men.
10136-8{_}14139{_}The pheasant itself is a very good bird; and, imbibing the dressing and the flavour of the truffle and snipe, it becomes thrice better.
10136-8{_}14140{_}BROILED PHEASANT (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).
10136-8{_}14141{_}1043.
10136-8{_}14142{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pheasant, a little lard, egg and bread crumbs, salt and cayenne to taste.
10136-8{_}14143{_}_Mode_.--Cut the legs off at the first joint, and the remainder of the bird into neat pieces; put them into a fryingpan with a little lard, and when browned on both sides, and about half done, take them out and drain them; brush the pieces over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs with which has been mixed a good seasoning of cayenne and salt.
10136-8{_}14144{_}Broil them over a moderate fire for about 10 minutes, or rather longer, and serve with mushroom-sauce, sauce piquante, or brown gravy, in which a few game-bones and trimmings have been stewed.
10136-8{_}14145{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}14146{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}14147{_}_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.
10136-8{_}14148{_}THE HEIGHT OF EXCELLENCE IN A PHEASANT.--Things edible have     their degrees of excellence under various circumstances: thus,     asparagus, capers, peas, and partridges are best when young.
10136-8{_}14149{_}Perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity:     let us say, for example, melons and nearly all fruits (we must     except, perhaps, the medlar), with the majority of those animals     whose flesh we eat.
10136-8{_}14150{_}But others, again, are not good until     decomposition is about to set in; and here we may mention     particularly the snipe and the pheasant.
10136-8{_}14151{_}If the latter bird be     eaten so soon as three days after it has been killed, it then     has no peculiarity of flavour; a pullet would be more relished,     and a quail would surpass it in aroma.
10136-8{_}14152{_}Kept, however, a proper     length of time,--and this can be ascertained by a slight smell     and change of colour,--then it becomes a highly, flavoured dish,     occupying, so to speak, the middle distance between chicken and     venison.
10136-8{_}14153{_}It is difficult to define any exact time to "hang" a     pheasant; but any one possessed of the instincts of     gastronomical science, can at once detect the right moment when     a pheasant should be taken down, in the same way as a good cook     knows whether a bird should be removed from the spit, or have a     turn or two more.
10136-8{_}14154{_}TO DRESS PLOVERS.
10136-8{_}14155{_}1044.
10136-8{_}14156{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 plovers, butter, flour, toasted bread.
10136-8{_}14157{_}_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose those that feel hard at the vent, as that shows their fatness.
10136-8{_}14158{_}There are three sorts,--the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing.
10136-8{_}14159{_}They will keep good for some time, but if very stale, the feet will be very dry.
10136-8{_}14160{_}Plovers are scarcely fit for anything but roasting; they are, however, sometimes stewed, or made into a ragoût, but this mode of cooking is not to be recommended.
10136-8{_}14161{_}_Mode_.--Pluck off the feathers, wipe the outside of the birds with a damp cloth, and do not draw them; truss with the head under the wing, put them down to a clear fire, and lay slices of moistened toast in the dripping-pan, to catch the trail.
10136-8{_}14162{_}Keep them _well basted_, dredge them lightly with flour a few minutes before they are done, and let them be nicely frothed.
10136-8{_}14163{_}Dish them on the toasts, over which the _trail_ should be equally spread.
10136-8{_}14164{_}Pour round the toast a little good gravy, and send some to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}14165{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}14166{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}14167{_}6d.
10136-8{_}14168{_}the brace, if plentiful.
10136-8{_}14169{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.
10136-8{_}14170{_}_Seasonable_.--In perfection from the beginning of September to the end of January.
10136-8{_}14171{_}THE PLOVER.--There are two species of this bird, the grey and     the green, the former being larger than the other, and somewhat     less than the woodcock.
10136-8{_}14172{_}It has generally been classed with those     birds which chiefly live in the water; but it would seem only to     seek its food there, for many of the species breed upon the     loftiest mountains.
10136-8{_}14173{_}Immense flights of these birds are to be     seen in the Hebrides, and other parts of Scotland; and, in the     winter, large numbers are sent to the London market, which is     sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very     cheap.
10136-8{_}14174{_}Previous to dressing, they are kept till they have a game     flavour; and although their flesh is a favourite with many, it     is not universally relished.
10136-8{_}14175{_}The green is preferred to the grey,     but both are inferior to the woodcock.
10136-8{_}14176{_}Their eggs are esteemed     as a great delicacy.
10136-8{_}14177{_}Birds of this kind are migratory.
10136-8{_}14178{_}They     arrive in England in April, live with us all the spring and     summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by     getting together in flocks.
10136-8{_}14179{_}It is supposed that they then retire     to Spain, and frequent the sheep-walks with which that country     abounds.
10136-8{_}14180{_}[Illustration: THE PLOVER.]
10136-8{_}14181{_}TO DRESS THE PTARMIGAN.
10136-8{_}14182{_}1045.
10136-8{_}14183{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 birds; butter, flour, fried bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}14184{_}_Mode_.--The ptarmigan, or white grouse, when young and tender, are exceedingly fine eating, and should be kept as long as possible, to be good.
10136-8{_}14185{_}Pluck, draw, and truss them in the same manner as grouse, No.
10136-8{_}14186{_}1025, and roast them before a brisk fire.
10136-8{_}14187{_}Flour and froth them nicely, and serve on buttered toast, with a tureen of brown gravy.
10136-8{_}14188{_}Bread sauce, when liked, may be sent to table with them, and fried bread crumbs substituted for the toasted bread.
10136-8{_}14189{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}14190{_}_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.
10136-8{_}14191{_}_Seasonable_ from the beginning of February to the end of April.
10136-8{_}14192{_}THE PTARMIGAN, OR WHITE GROUSE.--This bird is nearly the same     size as red grouse, and is fond of lofty situations, where it     braves the severest weather, and is found in most parts of     Europe, as well as in Greenland.
10136-8{_}14193{_}At Hudson's Bay they appear in     such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently     taken at once in a net.
10136-8{_}14194{_}As they are as tame as chickens, this is     done without difficulty.
10136-8{_}14195{_}Buffon says that the Ptarmigan avoids     the solar heat, and prefers the frosts of the summits of the     mountains; for, as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains,     it ascends till it gains the top, where it makes a hole, and     burrows in the snow.
10136-8{_}14196{_}In winter, it flies in flocks, and feeds on     the wild vegetation of the hills, which imparts to its flesh a     bitter, but not altogether an unpalatable taste.
10136-8{_}14197{_}It is     dark-coloured, and has something of the flavour of the hare, and     is greatly relished, and much sought after by some sportsmen.
10136-8{_}14198{_}[Illustration: THE PTARMIGAN.]
10136-8{_}14199{_}TO DRESS QUAILS.
10136-8{_}14200{_}1046.
10136-8{_}14201{_}INGREDIENTS.--Quails, butter, toast.
10136-8{_}14202{_}_Mode_.--These birds keep good several days, and should be roasted without drawing.
10136-8{_}14203{_}Truss them in the same manner as woodcocks, No.
10136-8{_}14204{_}1062; roast them before a clear fire, keep them well basted, and serve on toast.
10136-8{_}14205{_}_Time_.--About 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}14206{_}_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.
10136-8{_}14207{_}_Sufficient_ 2 for a dish.
10136-8{_}14208{_}_Seasonable_ from October to December.
10136-8{_}14209{_}[Illustration: THE QUAIL.]
10136-8{_}14210{_}THE QUAIL.--Quails are almost universally diffused over Europe,     Asia, and Africa.
10136-8{_}14211{_}Being birds of passage, they are seen in     immense flocks, traversing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe to     Africa, in the autumn, and returning again in the spring,     frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of     the Archipelago, which, with their vast numbers, they almost     completely cover.
10136-8{_}14212{_}On the western coasts of the kingdom of     Naples, they have appeared in such prodigious numbers, that,     within the compass of four or five miles, as many as a hundred     thousand have been taken in a day.
10136-8{_}14213{_}"From these circumstances,"     says a writer on natural history, "it appears highly probable     that the quails which supplied the Israelites with food during     their journey through the wilderness, were sent thither, on     their passage to the north, by a wind from the south-west,     sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia towards the shores of the Red     Sea."
10136-8{_}14214{_}In England they are not very numerous, although they breed     in it; and many of them are said to remain throughout the year,     changing their quarters from the interior parts of the country     for the seacoast.
10136-8{_}14215{_}TO DRESS SNIPES.
10136-8{_}14216{_}1047.
10136-8{_}14217{_}INGREDIENTS.--Snipes, butter, flour, toast.
10136-8{_}14218{_}_Mode_.--These, like woodcocks, should be dressed without being drawn.
10136-8{_}14219{_}Pluck, and wipe them outside, and truss them with the head under the wing, having previously skinned that and the neck.
10136-8{_}14220{_}Twist the legs at the first joint, press the feet upon the thighs, and pass a skewer through these and the body.
10136-8{_}14221{_}Place four on a skewer, tie them on to the jack or spit, and roast before a clear fire for about 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}14222{_}Put some pieces of buttered toast into the dripping-pan to catch the trails; flour and froth the birds nicely, dish the pieces of toast with the snipes on them, and pour round, but not over them, a little good brown gravy.
10136-8{_}14223{_}They should be sent to table very hot and expeditiously, or they will not be worth eating.--See coloured plate M1.
10136-8{_}14224{_}[Illustration: ROAST SNIPE.]

10136-8{_}14233{_}[Illustration: THE SNIPE.]
10136-8{_}14234{_}THE SNIPE.--This is a migratory bird, and is generally     distributed over Europe.
10136-8{_}14235{_}It is found in most parts of England,     in the high as well as the low lands, depending much on the     weather.
10136-8{_}14236{_}In very wet seasons it resorts to the hills, but at     other times frequents marshes, where it can penetrate the earth     with its bill, hunting for worms, which form its principal food.
10136-8{_}14237{_}In the Hebrides and the Orkneys snipes are plentiful, and they     are fattest in frosty weather.
10136-8{_}14238{_}In the breeding season the snipe     changes its note entirely from that which it has in the winter.
10136-8{_}14239{_}The male will keep on wing for an hour together, mounting like a     lark, and uttering a shrill piping noise; then, with a bleating     sound, not unlike that made by an old goat, it will descend with     great velocity, especially if the female be sitting in her nest,     from which it will not wander far.
10136-8{_}14240{_}ROAST TEAL.
10136-8{_}14241{_}1048.
10136-8{_}14242{_}INGREDIENTS.--Teal, butter, a little flour.
10136-8{_}14243{_}_Mode_.--Choose fat plump birds, after the frost has set in, as they are generally better flavoured; truss them in the same manner as wild duck, No.
10136-8{_}14244{_}1022; roast them before a brisk fire, and keep them well basted.
10136-8{_}14245{_}Serve with brown or orange gravy, water-cresses, and a cut lemon.

10136-8{_}14252{_}ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.
10136-8{_}14253{_}1049.
10136-8{_}14254{_}INGREDIENTS.--Venison, coarse flour-and-water paste, a little flour.
10136-8{_}14255{_}_Mode_.--Choose a haunch with clear, bright, and thick fat, and the cleft of the hoof smooth and close; the greater quantity of fat there is, the better quality will the meat be.
10136-8{_}14256{_}As many people object to venison when it has too much _haut goût_, ascertain how long it has been kept, by running a sharp skewer into the meat close to the bone; when this is withdrawn, its sweetness can be judged of.
10136-8{_}14257{_}With care and attention, it will keep good a fortnight, unless the weather is very mild.
10136-8{_}14258{_}Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains, and sprinkle over powdered ginger or pepper, as a preventative against the fly.
10136-8{_}14259{_}When required for use, wash it in warm water, and _dry_ it _well_ with a cloth; butter a sheet of white paper, put it over the fat, lay a coarse paste, about 1/2 inch in thickness, over this, and then a sheet or two of strong paper.
10136-8{_}14260{_}Tie the whole firmly on to the haunch with twine, and put the joint down to a strong close fire; baste the venison immediately, to prevent the paper and string from burning, and continue this operation, without intermission, the whole of the time it is cooking.
10136-8{_}14261{_}About 20 minutes before it is done, carefully remove the paste and paper, dredge the joint with flour, and baste well with _butter_ until it is nicely frothed, and of a nice pale-brown colour; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper, and serve with a good, strong, but unflavoured gravy, in a tureen, and currant jelly; or melt the jelly with a little port wine, and serve that also in a tureen.
10136-8{_}14262{_}As the principal object in roasting venison is to preserve the fat, the above is the best mode of doing so where expense is not objected to; but, in ordinary cases, the paste may be dispensed with, and a double paper placed over the roast instead: it will not require so long cooking without the paste.
10136-8{_}14263{_}Do not omit to send very hot plates to table, as the venison fat so soon freezes: to be thoroughly enjoyed by epicures, it should be eaten on hot-water plates.
10136-8{_}14264{_}The neck and shoulder may be roasted in the same manner.
10136-8{_}14265{_}[Illustration: ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.]

10136-8{_}14275{_}THE DEER.--This active tribe of animals principally inhabit wild     and woody regions.
10136-8{_}14276{_}In their contentions, both with each other     and the rest of the brute creation, these animals not only use     their horns, but strike very furiously with their fore feet.
10136-8{_}14277{_}Some of the species are employed as beasts of draught, whilst     the flesh of the whole is wholesome, and that of some of the     kinds, under the name of "venison," is considered very     delicious.
10136-8{_}14278{_}Persons fond of hunting have invented peculiar terms     by which the objects of their pursuit are characterized: thus     the stag is called, the first year, a _calf_, or _hind-calf_;     the second, a _knobber_; the third, a _brock_; the fourth, a     _staggard_; the fifth, a _stag_; and the sixth, a _hart_.
10136-8{_}14279{_}The     female is, the first year, called a _calf_; the second, a     _hearse_; and the third, a _hind_.
10136-8{_}14280{_}In Britain, the stag has     become scarcer than it formerly was; but, in the Highlands of     Scotland, herds of four or five hundred may still be seen,     ranging over the vast mountains of the north; and some of the     stags of a great size.
10136-8{_}14281{_}In former times, the great feudal     chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns,     assembling some thousands of their clans, who drove the deer     into the toils, or to such stations as were occupied by their     chiefs.
10136-8{_}14282{_}As this sport, however, was occasionally used as a means     for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of     concocting rebellion, an act was passed prohibitory of such     assemblages.
10136-8{_}14283{_}In the "Waverley" of Sir Walter Scott, a     deer-hunting scene of this kind is admirably described.
10136-8{_}14284{_}VENISON.--This is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of     deer, and is esteemed as very delicious.
10136-8{_}14285{_}Different species of     deer are found in warm as well as cold climates, and are in     several instances invaluable to man.
10136-8{_}14286{_}This is especially the case     with the Laplander, whose reindeer constitutes a large     proportion of his wealth.
10136-8{_}14287{_}There--        "The reindeer unharness'd in freedom can play,       And safely o'er Odin's steep precipice stray,       Whilst the wolf to the forest recesses may fly,       And howl to the moon as she glides through the sky."
10136-8{_}14288{_}In that country it is the substitute for the horse, the cow, the     goat, and the sheep.
10136-8{_}14289{_}From its milk is produced cheese; from its     skin, clothing; from its tendons, bowstrings and thread; from     its horns, glue; from its bones, spoons; and its flesh furnishes     food.
10136-8{_}14290{_}In England we have the stag, an animal of great beauty,     and much admired.
10136-8{_}14291{_}He is a native of many parts of Europe, and is     supposed to have been originally introduced into this country     from France.
10136-8{_}14292{_}About a century back he was to be found wild in     some of the rough and mountainous parts of Wales, as well as in     the forests of Exmoor, in Devonshire, and the woods on the banks     of the Tamar.
10136-8{_}14293{_}In the middle ages the deer formed food for the     not over abstemious monks, as represented by Friar Tuck's     larder, in the admirable fiction of "Ivanhoe;" and at a later     period it was a deer-stealing adventure that drove the     "ingenious" William Shakspeare to London, to become a common     player, and the greatest dramatist that ever lived.
10136-8{_}14294{_}HASHED VENISON.
10136-8{_}14295{_}1050.
10136-8{_}14296{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of roast venison, its own or mutton gravy, thickening of butter and flour.
10136-8{_}14297{_}_Mode_.--Cut the meat from the bones in neat slices, and, if there is sufficient of its own gravy left, put the meat into this, as it is preferable to any other.
10136-8{_}14298{_}Should there not be enough, put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan, with about a pint of mutton gravy; let them stew gently for an hour, and strain the gravy.
10136-8{_}14299{_}Put a little flour and butter into the stewpan, keep stirring until brown, then add the strained gravy, and give it a boil up; skim and strain again, and, when a little cool, put in the slices of venison.
10136-8{_}14300{_}Place the stewpan by the side of the fire, and, when on the point of simmering, serve: do not allow it to boil, or the meat will be hard.
10136-8{_}14301{_}Send red-currant jelly to table with it.
10136-8{_}14302{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}14303{_}_Seasonable_.--Buck venison, from June to Michaelmas; doe venison, from November to the end of January.
10136-8{_}14304{_}_Note_.--A small quantity of Harvey's sauce, ketchup, or port wine, may be added to enrich the gravy: these ingredients must, however, be used very sparingly, or they will overpower the flavour of the venison.
10136-8{_}14305{_}[Illustration: FALLOW-DEER (BUCK).
10136-8{_}14306{_}FALLOW-DEER (DOE).]
10136-8{_}14307{_}THE FALLOW-DEER.--This is the domestic or park deer; and no two     animals can make a nearer approach to each other than the stag     and it, and yet no two animals keep more distinct, or avoid each     other with a more inveterate animosity.
10136-8{_}14308{_}They never herd or     intermix together, and consequently never give rise to an     intermediate race; it is even rare, unless they have been     transported thither, to find fellow-deer in a country where     stags are numerous.
10136-8{_}14309{_}He is very easily tamed, and feeds upon many     things which the stag refuses: he also browzes closer than the     stag, and preserves his venison better.
10136-8{_}14310{_}The doe produces one     fawn, sometimes two, but rarely three.
10136-8{_}14311{_}In short, they resemble     the stag in all his natural habits, and the greatest difference     between them is the duration of their lives: the stag, it is     said, lives to the age of thirty-five or forty years, and the     fallow-deer does not live more than twenty.
10136-8{_}14312{_}As they are smaller     than the stag, it is probable that their growth is sooner     completed.
10136-8{_}14313{_}STEWED VENISON.
10136-8{_}14314{_}1051.
10136-8{_}14315{_}INGREDIENTS.--A shoulder of venison, a few slices of mutton fat, 2 glasses of port wine, pepper and allspice to taste, 1-1/2 pint of weak stock or gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole allspice.
10136-8{_}14316{_}_Mode_.--Hang the venison till tender; take out the bone, flatten the meat with a rolling-pin, and place over it a few slices of mutton fat, which have been previously soaked for 2 or 3 hours in port wine; sprinkle these with a little fine allspice and pepper, roll the meat up, and bind and tie it securely.
10136-8{_}14317{_}Put it into a stewpan with the bone and the above proportion of weak stock or gravy, whole allspice, black pepper, and port wine; cover the lid down closely, and simmer, very gently, from 3-1/2 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}14318{_}When quite tender, take off the tape, and dish the meat; strain the gravy over it, and send it to table with red-currant jelly.
10136-8{_}14319{_}Unless the joint is very fat, the above is the best mode of cooking it.

10136-8{_}14328{_}[Illustration: THE ROEBUCK.]
10136-8{_}14329{_}THE ROEBUCK.--This is the _Certuscapreolus_, or common roe, and     is of a reddish-brown colour.
10136-8{_}14330{_}It is an inhabitant of Asia, as     well as of Europe.
10136-8{_}14331{_}It has great grace in its movements, and     stands about two feet seven inches high, and has a length of     about three feet nine.
10136-8{_}14332{_}The extent of its horns is from six to     eight inches.
10136-8{_}14333{_}[Illustration: THE STAG.
10136-8{_}14334{_}THE HIND.]
10136-8{_}14335{_}THE STAG.--The stag, or hart, is the male of the red deer, and     the hind is the female.
10136-8{_}14336{_}He is much larger than the fallow-deer,     and his age is indicated by his horns, which are round instead     of being palmated, like those of the fallow-deer.
10136-8{_}14337{_}During the     first year he has no horns, but a horny excrescence, which is     short and rough, and covered with a thin hairy skin.
10136-8{_}14338{_}The next     year, the horns are single and straight; and in the third they     have two antlers, three the fourth, four the fifth, and five the     sixth year; although this number is not always certain, for     sometimes they are more, and often less.
10136-8{_}14339{_}After the sixth year,     the antlers do not always increase; and, although in number they     may amount to six or seven on each side, yet the animal's age is     then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the     thickness of the branch which sustains them, than by their     variety.
10136-8{_}14340{_}Large as these horns seem, however, they are shed every     year, and their place supplied by new ones.
10136-8{_}14341{_}This usually takes     place in the spring.
10136-8{_}14342{_}When the old horns have fallen off, the new     ones do not make their appearance immediately; but the bones of     the skull ore seen covered with a transparent periosteum, or     skin, which enwraps the bones of all animals.
10136-8{_}14343{_}After a short     time, however, the skin begins to swell, and to form a sort of     tumour.
10136-8{_}14344{_}From this, by-and-by, rising from the head, shoot forth     the antlers from each side; and, in a short time, in proportion     as the animal is in condition, the entire horns are completed.
10136-8{_}14345{_}The solidity of the extremities, however, is not perfect until     the horns have arrived at their full growth.
10136-8{_}14346{_}Old stags usually     shed their horns first, which generally happens towards the     latter end of February or the beginning of March.
10136-8{_}14347{_}Such as are     between five and six years old shed them about the middle or     latter end of March; those still younger in the month of April;     and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of     May.
10136-8{_}14348{_}These rules, though generally true, are subject to     variations; for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the     horns.--The HIND has no horns, and is less fitted for being     hunted than the male.
10136-8{_}14349{_}She takes the greatest care of her young,     and secretes them in the most obscure thickets, lest they become     a prey to their numerous enemies.
10136-8{_}14350{_}All the rapacious family of     the cat kind, with the wolf, the dog, the eagle, and the falcon,     are continually endeavouring to find her retreat, whilst the     stag himself is the foe of his own offspring.
10136-8{_}14351{_}When she has     young, therefore, it would seem that the courage of the male is     transferred to the female, for she defends them with the most     resolute bravery.
10136-8{_}14352{_}If pursued by the hunter, she will fly before     the hounds for half the day, and then return to her young, whose     life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own.
10136-8{_}14353{_}[Illustration: ELAND (BULL).
10136-8{_}14354{_}ELAND (COW).]
10136-8{_}14355{_}THE NEW VENISON.--The deer population of our splendid English     parks was, until a few years since, limited to two species, the     fallow and the red.
10136-8{_}14356{_}But as the fallow-deer itself was an     acclimated animal, of comparatively recent introduction, it came     to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deer-park     in England have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of     deer and antelopes, to adorn the hills, dales, ferny brakes, and     rich pastures of his domain?
10136-8{_}14357{_}The temperate regions of the whole     world might be made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant,     valuable either for their individual beauty, or for their     availability to gastronomic purposes.
10136-8{_}14358{_}During the last four or live years a few spirited English     noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in     their parks, and have obtained such a decided success, that it     may be hoped their example will induce others to follow in a     course which will eventually give to England's rural scenery a     new element of beauty, and to English tables a fresh viand of     the choicest character.
10136-8{_}14359{_}A practical solution of this interesting question was made by     Viscount Hill, at Hawkestone Park, Salop, in January, 1809.
10136-8{_}14360{_}On     that occasion a magnificent eland, an acclimated scion of the     species whose native home is the South African wilderness, was     killed for the table.
10136-8{_}14361{_}The noble beast was thus described:--"He     weighed 1,176 lbs.
10136-8{_}14362{_}as he dropped; huge as a short-horn, but with     bone not half the size; active as a deer, stately in all his     paces, perfect in form, bright in colour, with a vast dewlap,     and strong sculptured horn.
10136-8{_}14363{_}This eland in his lifetime strode     majestic on the hill-side, where he dwelt with his mates and     their progeny, all English-born, like himself."
10136-8{_}14364{_}Three pairs of     the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the     picturesque elopes throughout the day, and to return to their     home at pleasure.
10136-8{_}14365{_}"Here, during winter, they are assisted with     roots and hay, but in summer they have nothing but the pasture     of the park; so that, in point of expense, they cost no more     than cattle of the best description."
10136-8{_}14366{_}Travellers and sportsmen     say that the male eland is unapproached in the quality of his     flesh by any ruminant in South Africa; that it grows to an     enormous size, and lays on fat with as great facility as a true     short-horn; while in texture and flavour it is infinitely     superior.
10136-8{_}14367{_}The lean is remarkably fine, the fat firm and     delicate.
10136-8{_}14368{_}It was tried in every fashion,--braised brisket,     roasted ribs, broiled steaks, filet sauté, boiled aitchbone,     &c.,--and in all, gave evidence of the fact, that a new meat of     surpassing value had been added to the products of the English     park.
10136-8{_}14369{_}When we hear such a gratifying account of the eland, it is     pleasing to record that Lord Hastings has a herd of the Canadian     wapiti, a herd of Indian nylghaus, and another of the small     Indian hog-deer; that the Earl of Ducie has been successful in     breeding the magnificent Persian deer.
10136-8{_}14370{_}The eland was first     acclimated in England by the late Earl of Derby, between the     years 1835-1851, at his menagerie at Knowsley.
10136-8{_}14371{_}On his death, in     1851, he bequeathed to the Zoological Society his breed of     elands, consisting of two males and three females.
10136-8{_}14372{_}Here the     animals have been treated with the greatest success, and from     the year 1853 to the present time, the females have regularly     reproduced, without the loss of a single calf.

10136-8{_}14394{_}When done, dish the pieces of toast with the birds upon them, and pour round a very little gravy; send some more to table in a tureen.
10136-8{_}14395{_}These are most delicious birds when well cooked, but they should not be kept too long: when the feathers drop, or easily come out, they are fit for table.--See coloured plate, I 1.

10136-8{_}14400{_}[Illustration: THE WOODCOCK.]
10136-8{_}14401{_}THE WOODCOCK.--This bird being migratory in its habits, has,     consequently, no settled habitation; it cannot be considered as     the property of any one, and is, therefore, not game by law.
10136-8{_}14402{_}It     breeds in high northern latitudes, and the time of its     appearance and disappearance in Sweden coincides exactly with     that of its arrival in and return from Great Britain.
10136-8{_}14403{_}On the     coast of Suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been     accurately observed.
10136-8{_}14404{_}In the first week of October it makes its     appearance in small numbers, but in November and December it     appears in larger numbers, and always after sunset, and most     gregariously.
10136-8{_}14405{_}In the same manner as woodcocks take their leave     of us, they quit France, Germany, and Italy, making the northern     and colder climates their summer rendezvous.
10136-8{_}14406{_}They visit Burgundy     in the latter part of October, but continue there only a few     weeks, the country being hard, and unable to supply them with     such sustenance as they require.
10136-8{_}14407{_}In the winter, they are found     as far south as Smyrna and Aleppo, and, during the same season,     in Barbary, where the Africans name them "the ass of the     partridge."
10136-8{_}14408{_}It has been asserted that they have been seen as far     south as Egypt, which is the most remote region to which they     can be traced on that side of the eastern world; on the other     side, they are common in Japan.
10136-8{_}14409{_}Those which resort to the     countries of the Levant are supposed to come from the mountains     of Armenia, or the deserts of Tartary or Siberia.
10136-8{_}14410{_}The flesh of     the woodcock is held in high estimation; hence the bird is     eagerly sought after by the sportsman.
10136-8{_}14411{_}GAME CARVING.
10136-8{_}14412{_}BLACKCOCK.
10136-8{_}14413{_}[Illustration: BLACKCOCK.]
10136-8{_}14414{_}1054.
10136-8{_}14415{_}Skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the guests at a dinner-table; for game seems pre-eminently to be composed of such delicate limbs and tender flesh that an inapt practitioner appears to more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes, than larger and more robust _pièces de résistance_.
10136-8{_}14416{_}As described at recipe No.
10136-8{_}14417{_}1019, this bird is variously served with or without the head on; and although we do not personally object to the appearance of the head as shown in the woodcut, yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve it without.
10136-8{_}14418{_}The carving is not difficult, but should be elegantly and deftly done.
10136-8{_}14419{_}Slices from the breast, cut in the direction of the dotted line from 2 to 1, should be taken off, the merrythought displaced and the leg and wing removed by running the knife along from 3 to 4, and following the directions given under the head of boiled fowl, No.
10136-8{_}14420{_}1000, reserving the thigh, which is considered a great delicacy, for the most honoured guests, some of whom may also esteem the brains of this bird.
10136-8{_}14421{_}WILD DUCK.
10136-8{_}14422{_}[Illustration: WILD DUCK.]
10136-8{_}14423{_}1055.
10136-8{_}14424{_}As game is almost universally served as a dainty, and not as a dish to stand the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite, these dishes are not usually cut up entirely, but only those parts are served of each, which are considered the best-flavoured and the primest.
10136-8{_}14425{_}Of wild-fowl, the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eating, and slices are cut from this, in the direction indicated by the lines, from 1 to 2; if necessary, the leg and wing can be taken off by passing the knife from 3 to 4, and by generally following the directions described for carving boiled fowl, No.
10136-8{_}14426{_}1000.
10136-8{_}14427{_}ROAST HARE.
10136-8{_}14428{_}[Illustration: ROAST HARE.]
10136-8{_}14429{_}1056.
10136-8{_}14430{_}The "Grand Carver" of olden times, a functionary of no ordinary dignity, was pleased when he had a hare to manipulate, for his skill and grace had an opportunity of display.
10136-8{_}14431{_}_Diners à la Russe_ may possibly, erewhile, save modern gentlemen the necessity of learning the art which was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the youthful squire; but, until side-tables become universal, or till we see the office of "grand carver" once more instituted, it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish, which, if not the most elegant in appearance, is a very general favourite.
10136-8{_}14432{_}The hare, having its head to the left, as shown in the woodcut, should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone, in the direction of the lines from 3 to 4.
10136-8{_}14433{_}After these prime parts are disposed of, the leg should next be disengaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures 5 to 6.
10136-8{_}14434{_}The shoulders will then be taken off by passing the knife round from 7 to 8.
10136-8{_}14435{_}The back of the hare should now be divided by cutting quite through its spine, as shown by the line 1 to 2, taking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the back may be readily penetrated.
10136-8{_}14436{_}It is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare; and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs and placed alone on the plate.
10136-8{_}14437{_}In large establishments, and where men-cooks are kept, it is often the case that the backbone of the hare, especially in old animals, is taken out, and then the process of carving is, of course, considerably facilitated.
10136-8{_}14438{_}A great point to be remembered in connection with carving hare is, that plenty of gravy should accompany each helping; otherwise this dish, which is naturally dry, will lose half its flavour, and so become a failure.
10136-8{_}14439{_}Stuffing is also served with it; and the ears, which should be nicely crisp, and the brains of the hare, are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs.
10136-8{_}14440{_}PARTRIDGES.
10136-8{_}14441{_}[Illustration: ROAST PARTRIDGES.]
10136-8{_}14442{_}1057.
10136-8{_}14443{_}There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird.
10136-8{_}14444{_}The more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breastbone of the bird, and cut it quite through, thus dividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts, in the same manner as carving a pigeon, No.
10136-8{_}14445{_}1003.
10136-8{_}14446{_}Another plan is to cut it into three pieces; viz., by severing a small wing and leg on either side from the body, by following the line 1 to 2 in the upper woodcut; thus making 2 helpings, when the breast will remain for a third plate.
10136-8{_}14447{_}The most elegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs, and then cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line 1 to 2: this plan will give 4 or more small helpings.
10136-8{_}14448{_}A little bread-sauce should be served to each guest.
10136-8{_}14449{_}GROUSE.
10136-8{_}14450{_}[Illustration]  1058.
10136-8{_}14451{_}GROUSE may be carved in the way first described in carving partridge.
10136-8{_}14452{_}The backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many, and this part of many game birds is considered the finest flavoured.
10136-8{_}14453{_}PHEASANT.
10136-8{_}14454{_}[Illustration: ROAST PHEASANT.]
10136-8{_}14455{_}1059.
10136-8{_}14456{_}Fixing the fork in the breast, let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of the lines from 2 to 1: these are the prime pieces.
10136-8{_}14457{_}If there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve, then let the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described in carving boiled fowl, No.
10136-8{_}14458{_}1000, the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully found.
10136-8{_}14459{_}The merrythought will come off in the same way as that of a fowl.
10136-8{_}14460{_}The most valued parts are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl.
10136-8{_}14461{_}SNIPE.
10136-8{_}14462{_}[Illustration: SNIPE.]
10136-8{_}14463{_}1060.
10136-8{_}14464{_}One of these small but delicious birds may be given, whole, to a gentleman; but, in helping a lady, it will be better to cut them quite through the centre, from 1 to 2, completely dividing them into equal and like portions, and put only one half on the plate.
10136-8{_}14465{_}HAUNCH OF VENISON.
10136-8{_}14466{_}[Illustration: HAUNCH OF VENISON.]
10136-8{_}14467{_}1061.
10136-8{_}14468{_}Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise his skill upon, and, what will be pleasant for many to know, there is but little difficulty in the performance.
10136-8{_}14469{_}An incision being made completely down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2, the gravy will then be able easily to flow; when slices, not too thick, should be cut along the haunch, as indicated by the line 4 to 3; that end of the joint marked 3 having been turned towards the carver, so that he may have a more complete command over the joint.
10136-8{_}14470{_}Although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others, yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line.
10136-8{_}14471{_}It should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver will be the best carver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses much of its charm.
10136-8{_}14472{_}WOODCOCK.
10136-8{_}14473{_}[Illustration: WOODCOCK.]
10136-8{_}14474{_}1062.
10136-8{_}14475{_}This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions, or made into three helpings, as described in carving partridge (No.
10136-8{_}14476{_}1057).
10136-8{_}14477{_}The backbone is considered the tit-bit of a woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy.
10136-8{_}14478{_}This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin, in connection with the pheasant, viz., on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting; and a piece of this toast should invariably accompany each plate.
10136-8{_}14479{_}LANDRAIL.
10136-8{_}14480{_}1063.
10136-8{_}14481{_}LANDRAIL, being trussed like Snipe, with the exception of its being drawn, may be carved in the same manner.--See No.

10136-8{_}14484{_}1064.
10136-8{_}14485{_}PTARMIGAN, being of much the same size, and trussed in the same manner, as the red-bird, may be carved in the manner described in Partridge and Grouse carving, Nos.

10136-8{_}14487{_}QUAILS.

10136-8{_}14489{_}QUAILS, being trussed and served like Woodcock, may be similarly carved.--See No.

10136-8{_}14492{_}1066.
10136-8{_}14493{_}PLOVERS may be carved like Quails or Woodcock, being trussed and served in the same way as those birds.--See No.

10136-8{_}14496{_}1067.
10136-8{_}14497{_}TEAL, being of the same character as Widgeon and Wild Duck, may be treated, in carving, in the same style.

10136-8{_}14503{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON VEGETABLES.
10136-8{_}14504{_}"Strange there should be found   Who, self-imprison'd in their proud saloons,   Renounce the odours of the open field   For the unscented fictions of the loom;   Who, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,   Prefer to the performance of a God,   Th' inferior wonders of an artist's hand!
10136-8{_}14505{_}Lovely, indeed, the mimic works of art,   But Nature's works far lovelier."--COWPER.
10136-8{_}14506{_}1069.
10136-8{_}14507{_}"THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS," says Hogg, in his Natural History of the Vegetable Kingdom, "may be aptly compared to the primary colours of the prismatic spectrum, which are so gradually and intimately blended, that we fail to discover where the one terminates and where the other begins.
10136-8{_}14508{_}If we had to deal with yellow and blue only, the eye would easily distinguish the one from the other; but when the two are blended, and form green, we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow begins.
10136-8{_}14509{_}And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
10136-8{_}14510{_}If our powers of observation were limited to the highest orders of animals and plants, if there were only mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects in the one, and trees, shrubs, and herbs in the other, we should then be able with facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms; but as we descend the scale of each, and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants, we there meet with bodies of the simplest structure, sometimes a mere cell, whose organization, modes of development and reproduction, are so anomalous, and partake so much of the character of both, that we cannot distinguish whether they are plants or whether they are animals."
10136-8{_}14511{_}1070.
10136-8{_}14512{_}WHILST IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE where the animal begins and the vegetable ends, it is as difficult to account for many of the singularities by which numbers of plants are characterized.
10136-8{_}14513{_}This, however, can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise, when we recollect that, so far as it is at present known, the vegetable kingdom is composed of upwards of 92,000 species of plants.
10136-8{_}14514{_}Of this amazing number the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest kinds.
10136-8{_}14515{_}These, indeed, may be considered as the very creators of the soil: they thrive in the coldest and most sterile regions, many of them commencing the operations of nature in the growth of vegetables on the barest rocks, and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be supplied to them by the simple elements of air and rain.
10136-8{_}14516{_}When they have exhausted their period in such situations as have been assigned them, they pass into a state of decay, and become changed into a very fine mould, which, in the active spontaneity of nature, immediately begins to produce other species, which in their turn become food for various mosses, and also rot.
10136-8{_}14517{_}This process of growth and decay, being, from time to time, continued, by-and-by forms a soil sufficient for the maintenance of larger plants, which also die and decay, and so increase the soil, until it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak, or even the weight of a tropical forest.
10136-8{_}14518{_}To create soil amongst rocks, however, must not be considered as the only end of the lichen; different kinds of it minister to the elegant arts, in the form of beautiful dyes; thus the _lichen rocella_ is used to communicate to silk and wool, various shades of purple and crimson, which greatly enhance the value of these materials.
10136-8{_}14519{_}This species is chiefly imported from the Canary Islands, and, when scarce, as an article of commerce has brought as much as £1000 per ton.
10136-8{_}14520{_}1071.
10136-8{_}14521{_}IN THE VICINITY OF LICHENS, THE MUSCI, OR MOSSES, are generally to be found.
10136-8{_}14522{_}Indeed, wherever vegetation can be sustained, there they are, affording protection to the roots and seeds of more delicate vegetables, and, by their spongy texture, retaining a moisture which preserves other plants from the withering drought of summer.
10136-8{_}14523{_}But even in winter we find them enlivening, by their verdure, the cold bosom of Nature.
10136-8{_}14524{_}We see them abounding in our pastures and our woods, attaching themselves to the living, and still more abundantly to the dead, trunks and branches of trees.
10136-8{_}14525{_}In marshy places they also abound, and become the medium of their conversion into fruitful fields.
10136-8{_}14526{_}This is exemplified by the manner in which peat-mosses are formed: on the surface of these we find them in a state of great life and vigour; immediately below we discover them, more or less, in a state of decomposition; and, still deeper, we find their stems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat.
10136-8{_}14527{_}Thus are extensive tracts formed, ultimately to be brought into a state of cultivation, and rendered subservient to the wants of man.
10136-8{_}14528{_}1072.
10136-8{_}14529{_}WHEN NATURE HAS FOUND A SOIL, her next care is to perfect the growth of her seeds, and then to disperse them.
10136-8{_}14530{_}Whilst the seed remains confined in its capsule, it cannot answer its purpose; hence, when it is sufficiently ripe, the pericardium opens, and lets it out.
10136-8{_}14531{_}What must strike every observer with surprise is, how nuts and shells, which we can hardly crack with our teeth, or even with a hammer, will divide of themselves, and make way for the little tender sprout which proceeds from the kernel.
10136-8{_}14532{_}There are instances, it is said, such as in the Touch-me-not (_impatiens_), and the Cuckoo-flower (_cardamine_), in which the seed-vessels, by an elastic jerk at the moment of their explosion, cast the seeds to a distance.
10136-8{_}14533{_}We are all aware, however, that many seeds--those of the most composite flowers, as of the thistle and dandelion--are endowed with, what have not been inappropriately called, wings.
10136-8{_}14534{_}These consist of a beautiful silk-looking down, by which they are enabled to float in the air, and to be transported, sometimes, to considerable distances from the parent plant that produced them.
10136-8{_}14535{_}The swelling of this downy tuft within the seed-vessel is the means by which the seed is enabled to overcome the resistance of its coats, and to force for itself a passage by which it escapes from its little prison-house.
10136-8{_}14536{_}[Illustration: BEETON'S Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT EDITED BY MRS. ISABELLA BEETON]  [Illustration: "THE FREE, FAIR HOMES OF ENGLAND."]
10136-8{_}14537{_}1073.
10136-8{_}14538{_}BIRDS, AS WELL AS QUADRUPEDS, are likewise the means of dispersing the seeds of plants, and placing them in situations where they ultimately grow.
10136-8{_}14539{_}Amongst the latter is the squirrel, which is an extensive planter of oaks; nay, it may be regarded as having, in some measure, been one of the creators of the British navy.
10136-8{_}14540{_}We have read of a gentleman who was walking one day in some woods belonging to the Duke of Beaufort, near Troy House, in Monmouthshire, when his attention was arrested by a squirrel, sitting very composedly upon the ground.
10136-8{_}14541{_}He stopped to observe its motions, when, in a short time, the little animal suddenly quitted its position, and darted to the top of the tree beneath which it had been sitting.
10136-8{_}14542{_}In an instant it returned with an acorn in its mouth, and with its paws began to burrow in the earth.
10136-8{_}14543{_}After digging a small hole, it therein deposited an acorn, which it hastily covered, and then darted up the tree again.
10136-8{_}14544{_}In a moment it was down with another, which it buried in the same manner; and so continued its labour, gathering and burying, as long as the gentleman had patience to watch it.
10136-8{_}14545{_}This industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay up a store of provision for the winter; and as it is probable that its memory is not sufficiently retentive to enable it to recollect all the spots in which it deposits its acorns, it no doubt makes some slips in the course of the season, and loses some of them.
10136-8{_}14546{_}These few spring up, and are, in time, destined to supply the place of the parent tree.
10136-8{_}14547{_}Thus may the sons of Britain, in some degree, consider themselves to be indebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal for the production of some of those "wooden walls" which have, for centuries, been the national pride, and which have so long "braved the battle and the breeze" on the broad bosom of the great deep, in every quarter of the civilized globe.
10136-8{_}14548{_}As with the squirrel, so with jays and pies, which plant among the grass and moss, horse-beans, and probably forget where they have secreted them.
10136-8{_}14549{_}Mr. White, the naturalist, says, that both horse-beans and peas sprang up in his field-walks in the autumn; and he attributes the sowing of them to birds.
10136-8{_}14550{_}Bees, he also observes, are much the best setters of cucumbers.
10136-8{_}14551{_}If they do not happen to take kindly to the frames, the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom.
10136-8{_}14552{_}When they are once induced to haunt the frames, they set all the fruit, and will hover with impatience round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened.
10136-8{_}14553{_}1074.
10136-8{_}14554{_}Some of the acorns planted by the squirrel of Monmouthshire may be now in a fair way to become, at the end of some centuries, venerable trees; for not the least remarkable quality of oaks is the strong principle of life with which they are endued.
10136-8{_}14555{_}In Major Rooke's "Sketch of the forest of Sherwood" we find it stated that, on some timber cut down in Berkland and Bilhaugh, letters were found stamped in the bodies of the trees, denoting the king's reign in which they were marked.
10136-8{_}14556{_}The bark appears to have been cut off, and then the letters to have been cut in, and the next year's wood to have grown over them without adhering to where the bark had been cut out.
10136-8{_}14557{_}The ciphers were found to be of James I., William and Mary, and one of King John.
10136-8{_}14558{_}One of the ciphers of James was about one foot within the tree, and one foot from the centre.
10136-8{_}14559{_}It was cut down in 1786.
10136-8{_}14560{_}The tree must have been two feet in diameter, or two yards in circumference, when the mark was cut.
10136-8{_}14561{_}A tree of this size is generally estimated at 120 years' growth; which number being subtracted from the middle year of the reign of James, would carry the year back to 1492, which would be about the period of its being planted.
10136-8{_}14562{_}The tree with the cipher of William and Mary displayed its mark about nine inches within the tree, and three feet three inches from the centre.
10136-8{_}14563{_}This tree was felled in 1786.
10136-8{_}14564{_}The cipher of John was eighteen inches within the tree, and rather more than a foot from the centre.
10136-8{_}14565{_}The middle year of the reign of that monarch was 1207.
10136-8{_}14566{_}By subtracting from this 120, the number of years requisite for a tree's growth to arrive at the diameter of two feet, the date of its being planted would seem to have been 1085, or about twenty years after the Conquest.
10136-8{_}14567{_}[Illustration: CELLULAR DEVELOPMENT.]
10136-8{_}14568{_}1075.
10136-8{_}14569{_}Considering the great endurance of these trees, we are necessarily led to inquire into the means by which they are enabled to arrive at such strength and maturity; and whether it may be considered as a humiliation we will not determine, but, with all the ingenious mechanical contrivances of man, we are still unable to define the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
10136-8{_}14570{_}"Plants have been described by naturalists, who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms, as organized living bodies, without volition or locomotion, destitute of a mouth or intestinal cavity, which, when detached from their place of growth, die, and, in decay, ferment, but do not putrefy, and which, on being subjected to analysis, furnish an excess of carbon and no nitrogen.
10136-8{_}14571{_}The powers of chemistry, and of the microscope, however, instead of confirming these views, tend more and more to show that a still closer affinity exists between plants and animals; for it is now ascertained that nitrogen, which was believed to be present only in animals, enters largely into the composition of plants also.
10136-8{_}14572{_}When the microscope is brought to aid our powers of observation, we find that there are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom which possess very evident powers of locomotion, and which change about in so very remarkable a manner, that no other cause than that of volition can be assigned to it."
10136-8{_}14573{_}Thus it would seem that, in this particular at least, some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal life; and when we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourishment, and perform the functions of their existence, the resemblance would seem still closer.
10136-8{_}14574{_}If, for example, we take a thin transverse slice of the stem of any plant, or a slice cut across its stem, and immerse it in a little pure water, and place it under a microscope, we will find that it consists principally of cells, more or less regular, and resembling those of a honeycomb or a network of cobweb.
10136-8{_}14575{_}The size of these varies in different plants, as it does in different parts of the same plant, and they are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square inch of surface.
10136-8{_}14576{_}This singular structure, besides containing water and air, is the repository or storehouse of various secretions.
10136-8{_}14577{_}Through it, the sap, when produced, is diffused sideways through the plant, and by it numerous changes are effected in the juices which fill its cells.
10136-8{_}14578{_}The forms of the cells are various; they are also subject to various transformations.
10136-8{_}14579{_}Sometimes a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to end, and, by the absorption of the transverse partitions, form a continuous tube, as in the sap-vessels of plants, or in muscular and nervous fibre; and when cells are thus woven together, they are called cellular tissue, which, in the human body, forms a fine net-like membrane, enveloping or connecting most of its structures.
10136-8{_}14580{_}In pulpy fruits, the cells may be easily separated one from the other; and within the cells are smaller cells, commonly known as pulp.
10136-8{_}14581{_}Among the cell-contents of some plants are beautiful crystals, called _raphides_.
10136-8{_}14582{_}The term is derived from [Greek: rhaphis] a _needle_, on account of the resemblance of the crystal to a needle.
10136-8{_}14583{_}They are composed of the phosphate and oxalate of lime; but there is great difference of opinion as to their use in the economy of the plant, and one of the French philosophers endeavoured to prove that crystals are the possible transition of the inorganic to organic matter.
10136-8{_}14584{_}The differences, however, between the highest form of crystal and the lowest form of organic life known, viz., a simple reproductive cell, are so manifold and striking, that the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic matter passes into organic, is almost totally regarded as futile.
10136-8{_}14585{_}In a layer of an onion, a fig, a section of garden rhubarb, in some species of aloe, in the bark of many trees, and in portions of the cuticle of the medicinal squill, bundles of these needle-shaped crystals are to be found.
10136-8{_}14586{_}Some of them are as large as 1-40th of an inch, others are as small as the 1-1000th.
10136-8{_}14587{_}They are found in all parts of the plant,--in the stem, bark, leaves, stipules, petals, fruit, roots, and even in the pollen, with some few exceptions, and they are always situated in the interior of cells.
10136-8{_}14588{_}Some plants, as many of the _cactus_ tribe, are made up almost entirely of these needle-crystals; in some instances, every cell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals; in others, the whole interior is full of them, rendering the plant so exceedingly brittle, that the least touch will occasion a fracture; so much so, that some specimens of _Cactus senilis_, said to be a thousand years old, which were sent a few years since to Kew, from South America, were obliged to be packed in cotton, with all the care of the most delicate jewellery, to preserve them during transport.
10136-8{_}14589{_}[Illustration: SILICEOUS CUTICLE FROM UNDER-SIDE OF LEAF OF DEUTZIA SCABRA.]
10136-8{_}14590{_}[Illustration: SILICEOUS CUTICLE OF GRASS.]
10136-8{_}14591{_}1076.
10136-8{_}14592{_}Besides the cellular tissue, there is what is called a vascular system, which consists of another set of small vessels.
10136-8{_}14593{_}If, for example, we, early in the spring, cut a branch transversely, we will perceive the sap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided surface, except on that part occupied by the pith and the bark; and if a twig, on which the leaves are already unfolded, be cut from the tree, and placed with its cut end in a watery solution of Brazil-wood, the colouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top of the twig.
10136-8{_}14594{_}In both these cases, a close examination with a powerful microscope, will discover the sap perspiring from the divided portion of the stem, and the colouring matter rising through real tubes to the top of the twig: these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant.
10136-8{_}14595{_}If, however, we examine a transverse section of the vine, or of any other tree, at a later period of the season, we find that the wood is apparently dry, whilst the bark, particularly that part next the wood, is swelled with fluid.
10136-8{_}14596{_}This is contained in vessels of a different kind from those in which the sap rises.
10136-8{_}14597{_}They are found in the _bark_ only in trees, and may be called returning vessels, from their carrying the sap downwards after its preparation in the leaf.
10136-8{_}14598{_}It is believed that the passage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner precisely similar to that of the blood in man, from the regular contraction and expansion of the vessels; but, on account of their extreme minuteness, it is almost an impossibility to be certain upon this point.
10136-8{_}14599{_}Numerous observations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom exceeds a 290th part of a line, or a 3,000th part of an inch.
10136-8{_}14600{_}Leuwenhoeck reckoned 20,000 vessels in a morsel of oak about one nineteenth of an inch square.
10136-8{_}14601{_}1077.
10136-8{_}14602{_}In the vascular system of a plant, we at once see the great analogy which it bears to the veins and arteries in the human system; but neither it, nor the cellular tissue combined, is all that is required to perfect the production of a vegetable.
10136-8{_}14603{_}There is, besides, a tracheal system, which is composed of very minute elastic spiral tubes, designed for the purpose of conveying air both to and from the plant.
10136-8{_}14604{_}There are also fibres, which consist of collections of these cells and vessels closely united together.
10136-8{_}14605{_}These form the root and the stem.
10136-8{_}14606{_}If we attempt to cut them transversely, we meet with difficulty, because we have to force our way across the tubes, and break them; but if we slit the wood lengthwise, the vessels are separated without breaking.
10136-8{_}14607{_}The layers of wood, which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut transversely, consist of different zones of fibres, each the produce of one year's growth, and separated by a coat of cellular tissue, without which they could not be well distinguished.
10136-8{_}14608{_}Besides all these, there is the cuticle, which extends over every part of the plant, and covers the bark with three distinct coats.
10136-8{_}14609{_}The _liber_, or inner bark, is said to be formed of hollow tubes, which convey the sap downwards to increase the solid diameter of the tree.
10136-8{_}14610{_}1078.
10136-8{_}14611{_}THE ROOT AND THE STEM NOW DEMAND A SLIGHT NOTICE.
10136-8{_}14612{_}The former is designed, not only to support the plant by fixing it in the soil, but also to fulfil the functions of a channel for the conveyance of nourishment: it is therefore furnished with pores, or spongioles, as they are called, from their resemblance to a sponge, to suck up whatever comes within its reach.
10136-8{_}14613{_}It is found in a variety of forms, and hence its adaptation to a great diversity of soils and circumstances.
10136-8{_}14614{_}We have heard of a willow-tree being dug up and its head planted where its roots were, and these suffered to spread out in the air like naked branches.
10136-8{_}14615{_}In course of time, the roots became branches, and the branches roots, or rather, roots rose from the branches beneath the ground, and branches shot from the roots above.
10136-8{_}14616{_}Some roots last one year, others two, and others, like the shrubs and trees which they produce, have an indefinite period of existence; but they all consist of a collection of fibres, composed of vascular and cellular tissue, without tracheae, or breathing-vessels.
10136-8{_}14617{_}The stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment taken up by the roots, to the several parts of the plant.
10136-8{_}14618{_}The seat of its vitality is said to be in the point or spot called the neck, which separates the stem from the root.
10136-8{_}14619{_}If the root of a young plant be cut off, it will shoot out afresh; if even the stem be taken away, it will be renewed; but if this part be injured, the plant will assuredly die.
10136-8{_}14620{_}1079.
10136-8{_}14621{_}IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN OF THIS WORK, special notices of culinary vegetables will accompany the various recipes in which they are spoken of; but here we cannot resist the opportunity of declaring it as our conviction, that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental plant into our island, ought justly to be considered, to a large extent, a benefactor to the country.
10136-8{_}14622{_}No one can calculate the benefits which may spring from this very vegetable, after its qualities have become thoroughly known.
10136-8{_}14623{_}If viewed in no other light, it is pleasing to consider it as bestowing upon us a share of the blessings of other climates, and enabling us to participate in the luxury which a more genial sun has produced.

10136-8{_}14639{_}[Illustration: CARDOON ARTICHOKE.]
10136-8{_}14640{_}THE COMPOSITAE, OR COMPOSITE FLOWERS.--This family is so     extensive, as to contain nearly a twelfth part of the whole of     the vegetable kingdom.
10136-8{_}14641{_}It embraces about 9,000 species,     distributed over almost every country; and new discoveries are     constantly being made and added to the number.
10136-8{_}14642{_}Towards the poles     their numbers diminish, and slightly, also, towards the equator;     but they abound in the tropical and sub-tropical islands, and in     the tracts of continent not far from the sea-shore.
10136-8{_}14643{_}Among     esculent vegetables, the Lettuce, Salsify, Scorzonera, Cardoon,     and Artichoke belong to the family.

10136-8{_}14686{_}_Seasonable_ from September to June.
10136-8{_}14687{_}USES OF THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.--This being a tuberous-rooted     plant, with leafy stems from four to six feet high, it is     alleged that its tops will afford as much fodder per acre as a     crop of oats, or more, and its roots half as many tubers as an     ordinary crop of potatoes.
10136-8{_}14688{_}The tubers, being abundant in the     market-gardens, are to be had at little more than the price of     potatoes.
10136-8{_}14689{_}The fibres of the stems may be separated by     maceration, and manufactured into cordage or cloth; and this is     said to be done in some parts of the north and west of France,     as about Hagenau, where this plant, on the poor sandy soils, is     an object of field culture.

10136-8{_}14715{_}THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.--This plant is well known, being, for     its tubers, cultivated not only as a garden vegetable, but also     as an agricultural crop.
10136-8{_}14716{_}By many it is much esteemed as an     esculent, when cooked in various ways; and the domesticated     animals eat both the fresh foliage, and the tubers with great     relish.
10136-8{_}14717{_}By some, they are not only considered nourishing, but     even fattening.

10136-8{_}14722{_}ASPARAGUS TONGS.]
10136-8{_}14723{_}_Mode_.--Asparagus should be dressed as soon as possible after it is cut, although it may be kept for a day or two by putting the stalks into cold water; yet, to be good, like every other vegetable, it cannot be cooked too fresh.
10136-8{_}14724{_}Scrape the white part of the stems, _beginning_ from the _head_, and throw them into cold water; then tie them into bundles of about 20 each, keeping the heads all one way, and cut the stalks evenly, that they may all be the same length; put them into _boiling_ water, with salt in the above proportion; keep them boiling quickly until tender, with the saucepan uncovered.
10136-8{_}14725{_}When the asparagus is done, dish it upon toast, which should be dipped in the water it was cooked in, and leave the white ends outwards each war, with the points meeting in the middle.

10136-8{_}14733{_}[Illustration: ASPARAGUS.]
10136-8{_}14734{_}ASPARAGUS.--This plant belongs to the variously-featured family     of the order _Liliaceae_, which, in the temperate regions of     both hemispheres, are most abundant, and, between the tropics,     gigantic in size and arborescent in form.
10136-8{_}14735{_}Asparagus is a native     of Great Britain, and is found on various parts of the seacoast,     and in the fens of Lincolnshire.
10136-8{_}14736{_}At Kynarve Cove, in Cornwall,     there is an island called "Asparagus Island," from the abundance     in which it is there found.
10136-8{_}14737{_}The uses to which the young shoots     are applied, and the manure in which they are cultivated in     order to bring them to the highest state of excellence, have     been a study with many kitchen-gardeners.

10136-8{_}14742{_}of butter, a small bunch of parsley, 2 or 3 green onions, flour, 1 lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, salt.
10136-8{_}14743{_}_Mode_.--Carefully scrape the asparagus, cut it into pieces of an equal size, avoiding that which is in the least hard or tough, and throw them into cold water.
10136-8{_}14744{_}Then boil the asparagus in salt and water until three-parts done; take it out, drain, and place it on a cloth to dry the moisture away from it.
10136-8{_}14745{_}Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, and onions, and shake over a brisk fire for 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}14746{_}Dredge in a little flour, add the sugar, and moisten with boiling water.
10136-8{_}14747{_}When boiled a short time and reduced, take out the parsley and onions, thicken with the yolks of 2 eggs beaten with the cream; add a seasoning of salt, and, when the whole is on the point of simmering, serve.

10136-8{_}14754{_}MEDICINAL USES OF ASPARAGUS.--This plant not only acts as a     wholesome and nutritious vegetable, but also as a diuretic,     aperient, and deobstruent.
10136-8{_}14755{_}The chemical analysis of its juice     discovers its composition to be a peculiar crystallizable     principle, called asparagin, albumen, mannite, malic acid, and     some salts.
10136-8{_}14756{_}Thours says, the cellular tissue contains a     substance similar to sage.
10136-8{_}14757{_}The berries are capable of undergoing     vinous fermentation, and affording alcohol by distillation.
10136-8{_}14758{_}In     their unripe state they possess the same properties as the     roots, and probably in a much higher degree.
10136-8{_}14759{_}ASPARAGUS PUDDING.
10136-8{_}14760{_}(A delicious Dish, to be served with the Second Course.)
10136-8{_}14761{_}1089.
10136-8{_}14762{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of asparagus peas, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 tablespoonful of _very finely_ minced ham, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}14763{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste, milk.
10136-8{_}14764{_}_Mode_.--Cut up the nice green tender parts of asparagus, about the size of peas; put them into a basin with the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the flour, ham, butter, pepper, and salt.
10136-8{_}14765{_}Mix all these ingredients well together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of thick batter; put it into a pint buttered mould, tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, place it in _boiling water_, and let it boil for 2 hours; turn it out of the mould on to a hot dish, and pour plain melted butter _round_, but not over, the pudding.
10136-8{_}14766{_}Green peas pudding may be made in exactly the same manner, substituting peas for the asparagus.

10136-8{_}14772{_}BOILED FRENCH BEANS.
10136-8{_}14773{_}1090.
10136-8{_}14774{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a very small piece of soda.
10136-8{_}14775{_}[Illustration: Scarlet Runner.]
10136-8{_}14776{_}_Mode_.--This vegetable should always be eaten young, as, when allowed to grow too long, it tastes stringy and tough when cooked.
10136-8{_}14777{_}Cut off the heads and tails, and a thin strip on each side of the beans, to remove the strings.
10136-8{_}14778{_}Then divide each bean into 4 or 6 pieces, according to size, cutting them lengthways in a slanting direction, and, as they are cut, put them into cold water, with a small quantity of salt dissolved in it.
10136-8{_}14779{_}Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, with salt and soda in the above proportion; put in the beans, keep them boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, and be careful that they do not get smoked.
10136-8{_}14780{_}When tender, which may be ascertained by their sinking to the bottom of the saucepan, take them up, throw them into a colander; and when drained, dish and serve with plain melted butter.
10136-8{_}14781{_}When very young, beans are sometimes served whole: when they are thus dressed, their colour and flavour are much better preserved; but the more general way of dressing them is to cut them into thin strips.
10136-8{_}14782{_}_Time_.--Very young beans, 10 to 12 minutes; moderate size, 15 to 20 minutes, after the water boils.
10136-8{_}14783{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.
10136-8{_}14784{_}4d.

10136-8{_}14787{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of September; but may be had, forced, from February to the beginning of June.
10136-8{_}14788{_}FRENCH MODE OF COOKING FRENCH BEANS.
10136-8{_}14789{_}1091.
10136-8{_}14790{_}INGREDIENTS.--A quart of French beans, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}14791{_}of fresh butter, pepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1/2 lemon.
10136-8{_}14792{_}_Mode_.--Cut and boil the beans by the preceding recipe, and when tender, put them into a stewpan, and shake over the fire, to dry away the moisture from the beans.
10136-8{_}14793{_}When quite dry and hot, add the butter, pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; keep moving the stewpan, without using a spoon, as that would break the beans; and when the butter is melted, and all is thoroughly hot, serve.
10136-8{_}14794{_}If the butter should not mix well, add a tablespoonful of gravy, and serve very quickly.
10136-8{_}14795{_}_Time_.--About 1/4 hour to boil the beans; 10 minutes to shake them over the fire.
10136-8{_}14796{_}_Average cost_, in full season, about 1s.
10136-8{_}14797{_}4d.
10136-8{_}14798{_}a peck.
10136-8{_}14799{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}14800{_}_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of September.
10136-8{_}14801{_}BOILED BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS.
10136-8{_}14802{_}1092.
10136-8{_}14803{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; beans.
10136-8{_}14804{_}[Illustration: BROAD BEAN.]
10136-8{_}14805{_}_Mode_.--This is a favourite vegetable with many persons, but to be nice, should be young and freshly gathered.
10136-8{_}14806{_}After shelling the beans, put them into _boiling_ water, salted in the above proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender.
10136-8{_}14807{_}Drain them well in a colander; dish, and serve with them separately a tureen of parsley and butter.
10136-8{_}14808{_}Boiled bacon should always accompany this vegetable, but the beans should be cooked separately.
10136-8{_}14809{_}It is usually served with the beans laid round, and the parsley and butter in a tureen.
10136-8{_}14810{_}Beans also make an excellent garnish to a ham, and when used for this purpose, if very old, should have their skins removed.
10136-8{_}14811{_}_Time_.--Very young beans, 15 minutes; when of a moderate size, 20 to 25 minutes, or longer.
10136-8{_}14812{_}_Average cost_, unshelled, 6d.
10136-8{_}14813{_}per peck.
10136-8{_}14814{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow one peck for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}14815{_}_Seasonable_ in July and August.
10136-8{_}14816{_}NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE BEAN.--The produce of beans in meal     is, like that of peas, more in proportion to the grain than in     any of the cereal grasses.
10136-8{_}14817{_}A bushel of beans is supposed to     yield fourteen pounds more of flour than a bushel of oats; and a     bushel of peas eighteen pounds more, or, according to some,     twenty pounds.
10136-8{_}14818{_}A thousand parts of bean flour were found by Sir     II.
10136-8{_}14819{_}Davy to yield 570 parts of nutritive matter, of which 426     were mucilage or starch, 103 gluten, and 41 extract, or matter     rendered insoluble during the process.
10136-8{_}14820{_}BROAD BEANS A LA POULETTE.
10136-8{_}14821{_}1093.
10136-8{_}14822{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 pints of broad beans, 1/2 pint of stock or broth, a small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, a small lump of sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1/4 pint of cream, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}14823{_}_Mode_.--Procure some young and freshly-gathered beans, and shell sufficient to make 2 pints; boil them, as in the preceding recipe, until nearly done; then drain them and put them into a stewpan, with the stock, finely-minced herbs, and sugar.
10136-8{_}14824{_}Stew the beans until perfectly tender, and the liquor has dried away a little; then beat up the yolk of an egg with the cream, add this to the beans, let the whole get thoroughly hot, and when on the point of simmering, serve.
10136-8{_}14825{_}Should the beans be very large, the skin should be removed previously to boiling them.
10136-8{_}14826{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the beans, 15 minutes to stew them in the stock.
10136-8{_}14827{_}_Average cost_, unshelled, 6d.
10136-8{_}14828{_}per peck.
10136-8{_}14829{_}_Seasonable_ in July and August.
10136-8{_}14830{_}ORIGIN AND VARIETIES OF THE BEAN.--This valuable plant is said     to be a native of Egypt, but, like other plants which have been     domesticated, its origin is uncertain.
10136-8{_}14831{_}It has been cultivated in     Europe and Asia from time immemorial, and has been long known in     Britain.
10136-8{_}14832{_}Its varieties may be included under two general     heads,--the white, or garden beans, and the grey, or field     beans, of the former, sown in the fields, the mazagan and     long-pod are almost the only sorts; of the latter, those known     as the horse-bean, the small or ticks, and the prolific of     Heligoland, are the principal sorts.
10136-8{_}14833{_}New varieties are procured     in the same manner as in other plants.
10136-8{_}14834{_}BOILED BEETROOT.
10136-8{_}14835{_}1094.
10136-8{_}14836{_}INGREDIENTS,--Beetroot; boiling water.
10136-8{_}14837{_}_Mode_.--When large, young, and juicy, this vegetable makes a very excellent addition to winter salads, and may easily be converted into an economical and quickly-made pickle.
10136-8{_}14838{_}(_See_ No.
10136-8{_}14839{_}369.)
10136-8{_}14840{_}Beetroot is more frequently served cold than hot: when the latter mode is preferred, melted butter should be sent to table with it.
10136-8{_}14841{_}It may also be stewed with button onions, or boiled and served with roasted onions.
10136-8{_}14842{_}Wash the beets thoroughly; but do not prick or break the skin before they are cooked, or they would lose their beautiful colour in boiling.
10136-8{_}14843{_}Put them into boiling water, and let them boil until tender, keeping them well covered.
10136-8{_}14844{_}If to be served hot, remove the peel quickly, cut the beetroot into thick slices, and send to table melted butter.
10136-8{_}14845{_}For salads, pickle, &c., let the root cool, then peel, and cut it into slices.
10136-8{_}14846{_}_Time_.--Small beetroot, 1-1/2 to 2 hours; large, 2-1/2 to 3 hours.
10136-8{_}14847{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 2d.
10136-8{_}14848{_}each.
10136-8{_}14849{_}_Seasonable_.--May be had at any time.
10136-8{_}14850{_}[Illustration: BEETROOT.]
10136-8{_}14851{_}BEETROOT.--The geographical distribution of the order Saltworts     (_Salxolaceae_), to which beetroot belongs, is most common in     extra-tropical and temperate regions, where they are common     weeds, frequenting waste places, among rubbish, and on marshes     by the seashore.
10136-8{_}14852{_}In the tropics they are rare.
10136-8{_}14853{_}They are     characterized by the large quantities of mucilage, sugar,     starch, and alkaline salts which are found in them.
10136-8{_}14854{_}Many of them     are used as potherbs, and some are emetic and vermifuge in their     medicinal properties.
10136-8{_}14855{_}The _root_ of _garden_ or red beet is     exceedingly wholesome and nutritious, and Dr. Lyon Playfair has     recommended that a good brown bread may be made by rasping down     this root with an equal quantity of flour.
10136-8{_}14856{_}He says that the     average quality of flour contains about 12 per cent.
10136-8{_}14857{_}of azotized     principles adapted for the formation of flesh, and the average     quality of beet contains about 2 per cent.
10136-8{_}14858{_}of the same     materials.
10136-8{_}14859{_}BOILED BROCOLI.
10136-8{_}14860{_}1095.
10136-8{_}14861{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; brocoli.
10136-8{_}14862{_}[Illustration: BOILED BROCOLI.]
10136-8{_}14863{_}_Mode_.--Strip off the dead outside leaves, and the inside ones cut off level with the flower; cut off the stalk close at the bottom, and put the brocoli into cold salt and water, with the heads downwards.
10136-8{_}14864{_}When they have remained in this for about 3/4 hour, and they are _perfectly_ free from insects, put them into a saucepan of _boiling_ water, salted in the above proportion, and keep them boiling quickly over a brisk fire, with the saucepan uncovered.
10136-8{_}14865{_}Take them up with a slice the moment they are done; drain them well, and serve with a tureen of melted butter, a _little_ of which should be poured over the brocoli.
10136-8{_}14866{_}If left in the water after it is done, it will break, its colour will be spoiled, and its crispness gone.
10136-8{_}14867{_}_Time_.--Small brocoli, 10 to 15 minutes; large one, 20 to 25 minutes.
10136-8{_}14868{_}_Average cost_, 2d.
10136-8{_}14869{_}each.
10136-8{_}14870{_}_Sufficient_,--2 for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}14871{_}_Seasonable_ from October to March; plentiful in February and March.
10136-8{_}14872{_}[Illustration: BROCOLI.]
10136-8{_}14873{_}THE KOHL-RABI, OR TURNIP-CABBAGE.--This variety presents a     singular development, inasmuch as the stem swells out like a     large turnip on the surface of the ground, the leaves shooting     from it all round, and the top being surmounted by a cluster of     leaves issuing from it.
10136-8{_}14874{_}Although not generally grown as a garden     vegetable, if used when young and tender, it is wholesome,     nutritious, and very palatable.
10136-8{_}14875{_}BOILED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
10136-8{_}14876{_}1096.
10136-8{_}14877{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda.
10136-8{_}14878{_}_Mode_.--Clean the sprouts from insects, nicely wash them, and pick off any dead or discoloured leaves from the outsides; put them into a saucepan of _boiling_ water, with salt and soda in the above proportion; keep the pan uncovered, and let them boil quickly over a brisk fire until tender; drain, dish, and serve with a tureen of melted butter, or with a maître d'hôtel sauce poured over them.
10136-8{_}14879{_}Another mode of serving is, when they are dished, to stir in about 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}14880{_}of butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}14881{_}They must, however, be sent to table very quickly, as, being so very small, this vegetable soon cools.
10136-8{_}14882{_}Where the cook is very expeditious, this vegetable, when cooked, may be arranged on the dish in the form of a pineapple, and, so served, has a very pretty appearance.
10136-8{_}14883{_}_Time_.--From 9 to 12 minutes after the water boils.
10136-8{_}14884{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}14885{_}4d.
10136-8{_}14886{_}per peck.
10136-8{_}14887{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow between 40 and 50 for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}14888{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}14889{_}SAVOYS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--When the Green Kale, or Borecole,     has been advanced a step further in the path of improvement, it     assumes the headed or hearting character, with blistered leaves;     it is then known by the name of Savoys and Brussels Sprouts.
10136-8{_}14890{_}Another of its headed forms, but with smooth glaucous leaves, is     the cultivated Cabbage of our gardens (the _Borecole oleracea     capitula_ of science); and all its varieties of green, red,     dwarf, tall, early, late, round, conical, flat, and all the     forms into which it is possible to put it.
10136-8{_}14891{_}TO BOIL YOUNG GREENS OR SPROUTS.
10136-8{_}14892{_}1097.
10136-8{_}14893{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda.
10136-8{_}14894{_}[Illustration: BRUSSELS SPROUTS.]
10136-8{_}14895{_}_Mode_.--Pick away all the dead leaves, and wash the greens well in cold water; drain them in a colander, and put them into fast-boiling water, with salt and soda in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}14896{_}Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, until tender; and the moment they are done, take them up, or their colour will be spoiled; when well drained, serve.
10136-8{_}14897{_}The great art in cooking greens properly, and to have them a good colour, is to put them into _plenty_ of _fast-boiling_ water, to let them boil very quickly, and to take them up the moment they become tender.
10136-8{_}14898{_}_Time_.--Brocoli sprouts, 10 to 12 minutes; young greens, 10 to 12 minutes; sprouts, 12 minutes, after the water boils.
10136-8{_}14899{_}_Seasonable_.--Sprouts of various kinds may be had all the year.
10136-8{_}14900{_}GREEN KALE, OR BORECOLE.--When Colewort, or Wild Cabbage, is     brought into a state of cultivation, its character becomes     greatly improved, although it still retains the loose open     leaves, and in this form it is called Green Kale, or Borecole.
10136-8{_}14901{_}The scientific name is _Borecole oleracea acephala_, and of it     there are many varieties, both as regards the form and colour of     the leaves, as well as the height which the plants attain.
10136-8{_}14902{_}We     may observe, that among them, are included the Thousand-headed,     and the Cow or Tree Cabbage.
10136-8{_}14903{_}BOILED CABBAGE.
10136-8{_}14904{_}1098.
10136-8{_}14905{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda.
10136-8{_}14906{_}_Mode_.--Pick off all the dead outside leaves, cut off as much of the stalk as possible, and cut the cabbages across twice, at the stalk end; if they should be very large, quarter them.
10136-8{_}14907{_}Wash them well in cold water, place them in a colander, and drain; then put them into _plenty_ of _fast-boiling_ water, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportions.
10136-8{_}14908{_}Stir them down once or twice in the water, keep the pan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until tender.
10136-8{_}14909{_}The instant they are done, take them up into a colander, place a plate over them, let them thoroughly drain, dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}14910{_}_Time_.--Large cabbages, or savoys, 1/3 to 3/4 hour, young summer cabbage, 10 to 12 minutes, after the water boils.
10136-8{_}14911{_}_Average cost_, 2d.
10136-8{_}14912{_}each in full season.
10136-8{_}14913{_}_Sufficient_,--2 large ones for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}14914{_}_Seasonable_.--Cabbages and sprouts of various kinds at any time.
10136-8{_}14915{_}THE CABBAGE TRIBE: THEIR ORIGIN.--Of all the tribes of the     _Cruciferae_ this is by far the most important.
10136-8{_}14916{_}Its scientific     name is _Brassiceae_, and it contains a collection of plants     which, both in themselves and their products, occupy a prominent     position in agriculture, commerce, and domestic economy.
10136-8{_}14917{_}On the     cliffs of Dover, and in many places on the coasts of     Dorsetshire, Cornwall, and Yorkshire, there grows a wild plant,     with variously-indented, much-waved, and loose spreading leaves,     of a sea-green colour, and large yellow flowers.
10136-8{_}14918{_}In spring, the     leaves of this plant are collected by the inhabitants, who,     after boiling them in two waters, to remove the saltness, use     them as a vegetable along with their meat.
10136-8{_}14919{_}This is the _Brassica     oleracea_ of science, the Wild Cabbage, or Colewort, from which     have originated all the varieties of Cabbage, Cauliflower,     Greens, and Brocoli.
10136-8{_}14920{_}STEWED RED CABBAGE.
10136-8{_}14921{_}1099.
10136-8{_}14922{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 red cabbage, a small slice of ham, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}14923{_}of fresh butter, 1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 gill of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}14924{_}_Mode_.--Cut the cabbage into very thin slices, put it into a stewpan, with the ham cut in dice, the butter, 1/2 pint of stock, and the vinegar; cover the pan closely, and let it stew for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}14925{_}When it is very tender, add the remainder of the stock, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and the pounded sugar; mix all well together, stir over the fire until nearly all the liquor is dried away, and serve.

10136-8{_}14947{_}[Illustration: CARROTS.]
10136-8{_}14948{_}ORIGIN OF THE CARROT.--In its wild state, this vegetable is     found plentifully in Britain, both in cultivated lands and by     waysides, and is known by the name of birds-nest, from its     umbels of fruit becoming incurved from a hollow cup, like a     birds-nest.
10136-8{_}14949{_}In this state its root is whitish, slender, and     hard, with an acrid, disagreeable taste, and a strong aromatic     smell, and was formerly used as an aperient.
10136-8{_}14950{_}When cultivated, it     is reddish, thick, fleshy, with a pleasant odour, and a     peculiar, sweet, mucilaginous taste.
10136-8{_}14951{_}The carrot is said by     naturalists not to contain much nourishing matter, and,     generally speaking, is somewhat difficult of digestion.

10136-8{_}14953{_}1101.
10136-8{_}14954{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 large carrots, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}14955{_}of butter, salt to taste, a very little grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley, 1 dessertspoonful of minced onion, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 tablespoonful of flour.
10136-8{_}14956{_}_Mode_.--Wash and scrape the carrots, and cut them into rings of about 1/4 inch in thickness.
10136-8{_}14957{_}Put the butter into a stewpan; when it is melted, lay in the carrots, with salt, nutmeg, parsley, and onion in the above proportions.
10136-8{_}14958{_}Toss the stewpan over the fire for a few minutes, and when the carrots are well saturated with the butter, pour in the stock, and simmer gently until they are nearly tender.
10136-8{_}14959{_}Then put into another stewpan a small piece of butter; dredge in about a tablespoonful of flour; stir this over the fire, and when of a nice brown colour, add the liquor that the carrots have been boiling in; let this just boil up, pour it over the carrots in the other stewpan, and let them finish simmering until quite tender.
10136-8{_}14960{_}Serve very hot.
10136-8{_}14961{_}This vegetable, dressed as above, is a favourite accompaniment of roast pork, sausages, &c. &c.

10136-8{_}14968{_}CONSTITUENTS OF THE CARROT.--These are crystallizable and     uncrystallizable sugar, a little starch, extractive, gluten,     albumen, volatile oil, vegetable jelly, or pectin, saline     matter, malic acid, and a peculiar crystallizable ruby-red     neuter principle, without odour or taste, called carotin.
10136-8{_}14969{_}This     vegetable jelly, or pectin, so named from its singular property     of gelatinizing, is considered by some as another form of gum or     mucilage, combined with vegetable acid.
10136-8{_}14970{_}It exists more or less     in all vegetables, and is especially abundant in those roots and     fruits from which jellies are prepared.

10136-8{_}14982{_}_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.
10136-8{_}14983{_}NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE CARROT.--Sir H. Davy ascertained the     nutritive matter of the carrot to amount to ninety-eight parts     in one thousand; of which ninety-five are sugar and three are     starch.
10136-8{_}14984{_}It is used in winter and spring in the dairy to give     colour and flavour to butter; and it is excellent in stews,     haricots, soups, and, when boiled whole, with salt beef.
10136-8{_}14985{_}In the     distillery, owing to the great proportion of sugar in its     composition, it yields more spirit than the potato.
10136-8{_}14986{_}The usual     quantity is twelve gallons per ton.

10136-8{_}15000{_}_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.
10136-8{_}15001{_}THE SEED OF THE CARROT.--In order to save the seed of carrots,     the plan is, to select annually the most perfect and best-shaped     roots in the taking-up season, and either preserve them in sand     in a cellar till spring, or plant them immediately in an open     airy part of the garden, protecting them with litter during     severe frost, or earthing them over, and uncovering them in     March following.
10136-8{_}15002{_}The seed is in no danger from being injured by     any other plant.
10136-8{_}15003{_}In August it is fit to gather, and is best     preserved on the stalks till wanted.

10136-8{_}15009{_}_Mode_.--Choose cauliflowers that are close and white; trim off the decayed outside leaves, and cut the stalk off flat at the bottom.
10136-8{_}15010{_}Open the flower a little in places to remove the insects, which generally are found about the stalk, and let the cauliflowers lie in salt and water for an hour previous to dressing them, with their heads downwards: this will effectually draw out all the vermin.
10136-8{_}15011{_}Then put them into fast-boiling water, with the addition of salt in the above proportion, and let them boil briskly over a good fire, keeping the saucepan uncovered.
10136-8{_}15012{_}The water should be well skimmed; and, when the cauliflowers are tender, take them up with a slice; let them drain, and, if large enough, place them upright in the dish.

10136-8{_}15091{_}_Seasonable_ from October to April.
10136-8{_}15092{_}ORIGIN OF CELERY.--In the marshes and ditches of this country     there is to be found a very common plant, known by the name of     Smallage.
10136-8{_}15093{_}This is the wild form of celery; but, by being     subjected to cultivation, it loses its acrid nature, and becomes     mild and sweet.
10136-8{_}15094{_}In its natural state, it has a peculiar rank,     coarse taste and smell, and its root was reckoned by the     ancients as one of the "five greater aperient roots."
10136-8{_}15095{_}There is a     variety of this in which the root becomes turnip-shaped and     large.
10136-8{_}15096{_}It is called _Celeriae_, and is extensively used by the     Germans, and preferred by them to celery.
10136-8{_}15097{_}In a raw state, this     plant does not suit weak stomachs; cooked, it is less difficult     of digestion, although a large quantity should not he taken.

10136-8{_}15103{_}Put these into a saucepan, with the broth, and stew till tender, which will be in from 20 to 25 minutes; then add the remaining ingredients, simmer altogether for 4 or 5 minutes, pour into a dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}15104{_}It may be garnished with sippets of toasted bread.

10136-8{_}15131{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, salt and vinegar, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}15132{_}of butter, flour, 1/2 pint of broth, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, salt and pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}15133{_}_Mode_.--Pare and cut the cucumbers into slices of an equal thickness, and let them remain in a pickle of salt and vinegar for 1/2 hour; then drain them in a cloth, and put them into a stewpan with the butter.
10136-8{_}15134{_}Fry them over a brisk fire, but do not brown them, and then dredge over them a little flour; add the broth, skim off all the fat, which will rise to the surface, and boil gently until the gravy is somewhat reduced; but the cucumber should not be broken.
10136-8{_}15135{_}Stir in the yolks of the eggs, add the parsley, sugar, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; bring the whole to the point of boiling, and serve.
10136-8{_}15136{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour.
10136-8{_}15137{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d.

10136-8{_}15139{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15140{_}_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be had, forced, from the beginning of March.
10136-8{_}15141{_}FRIED CUCUMBERS.
10136-8{_}15142{_}1113.
10136-8{_}15143{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, pepper and salt to taste, flour, oil or butter.
10136-8{_}15144{_}_Mode_.--Pare the cucumbers and cut them into slices of an equal thickness, commencing to slice from the thick, and not the stalk end of the cucumber.
10136-8{_}15145{_}Wipe the slices dry with a cloth, dredge them with flour, and put them into a pan of boiling oil or butter; Keep turning them about until brown; lift them out of the pan, let them drain, and serve, piled lightly in a dish.
10136-8{_}15146{_}These will be found a great improvement to rump-steak: they should be placed on a dish with the steak on the top.
10136-8{_}15147{_}_Time_.--5 minutes.
10136-8{_}15148{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d.
10136-8{_}15149{_}each.
10136-8{_}15150{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15151{_}_Seasonable_.--Forced from the beginning of March to the end of June; in full season in July and August.
10136-8{_}15152{_}PROPERTIES AND USES OF THE CUCURBITS.--The common cucumber is     the C. sativus of science, and although the whole of the family     have a similar action in the animal economy, yet there are some     which present us with great anomalies.
10136-8{_}15153{_}The roots of those which     are perennial contain, besides fecula, which is their base, a     resinous, acrid, and bitter principle.
10136-8{_}15154{_}The fruits of this     family, however, have in general a sugary taste, and are more or     less dissolving and perfumed, as we find in the melons, gourds,     cucumbers, vegetable-marrows, and squashes.
10136-8{_}15155{_}But these are     slightly laxative if partaken of largely.
10136-8{_}15156{_}In tropical countries,     this order furnishes the inhabitants with a large portion of     their food, which, even in the most arid deserts and most barren     islands, is of the finest quality.
10136-8{_}15157{_}In China, Cashmere, and     Persia, they are cultivated on the lakes on the floating     collections of weeds common in these localities.
10136-8{_}15158{_}In India they     are everywhere abundant, either in a cultivated or wild state,     and the seeds of all the family are sweet and mucilaginous.
10136-8{_}15159{_}STEWED CUCUMBERS.
10136-8{_}15160{_}1114.
10136-8{_}15161{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 large cucumbers, flour, butter, rather more than 1/2 pint of good brown gravy.
10136-8{_}15162{_}_Mode_.--Cut the cucumbers lengthwise the size of the dish they are intended to be served in; empty them of the seeds, and put them into boiling water with a little salt, and let them simmer for 5 minutes; then take them out, place them in another stewpan, with the gravy, and let them boil over a brisk fire until the cucumbers are tender.
10136-8{_}15163{_}Should these be bitter, add a lump of sugar; carefully dish them, skim the sauce, pour over the cucumbers, and serve.
10136-8{_}15164{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}15165{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 1d.
10136-8{_}15166{_}each.
10136-8{_}15167{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}15168{_}_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August; but may be had, forced, from the beginning of March.
10136-8{_}15169{_}THE CHATE.--This cucumber is a native of Egypt and Arabia, and     produces a fruit of almost the same substance as that of the     Melon.
10136-8{_}15170{_}In Egypt it is esteemed by the upper class natives, as     well as by Europeans, as the most pleasant fruit they have.
10136-8{_}15171{_}STEWED CUCUMBERS WITH ONIONS.
10136-8{_}15172{_}1115.
10136-8{_}15173{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 cucumbers, 3 moderate-sized onions, not quite 1 pint of white stock, cayenne and salt to taste, the yolks of 2 eggs, a very little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}15174{_}_Mode_.--Pare and slice the cucumbers, take out the seeds, and cut the onions into thin slices; put these both into a stewpan, with the stock, and let them boil for 1/4 hour or longer, should the cucumbers be very large.
10136-8{_}15175{_}Beat up the yolks of 2 eggs; stir these into the sauce; add the cayenne, salt, and grated nutmeg; bring it to the point of boiling, and serve.
10136-8{_}15176{_}Do not allow the sauce to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}15177{_}This is a favourite dish with lamb or mutton chops, rump-steaks, &c.
10136-8{_}15178{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}15179{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d.
10136-8{_}15180{_}each.
10136-8{_}15181{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}15182{_}_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be had, forced, from the beginning of March.
10136-8{_}15183{_}THE MELON.--This is another species of the cucumber, and is     highly esteemed for its rich and delicious fruit.
10136-8{_}15184{_}It was     introduced to this country from Jamaica, in 1570; since which     period it has continued to be cultivated.
10136-8{_}15185{_}It was formerly called     the Musk Melon.
10136-8{_}15186{_}ENDIVE.
10136-8{_}15187{_}[Illustration: ENDIVE.]
10136-8{_}15188{_}1116.
10136-8{_}15189{_}This vegetable, so beautiful in appearance, makes an excellent addition to winter salad, when lettuces and other salad herbs are not obtainable.
10136-8{_}15190{_}It is usually placed in the centre of the dish, and looks remarkably pretty with slices of beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and curled celery placed round it, so that the colours contrast nicely.
10136-8{_}15191{_}In preparing it, carefully wash and cleanse it free from insects, which are generally found near the heart; remove any decayed or dead leaves, and dry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth.
10136-8{_}15192{_}This vegetable may also be served hot, stewed in cream, brown gravy, or butter; but when dressed thus, the sauce it is stewed in should not be very highly seasoned, as that would destroy and overpower the flavour of the vegetable.
10136-8{_}15193{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15194{_}per head.
10136-8{_}15195{_}_Sufficient_,--1 head for a salad for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}15196{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15197{_}ENDIVE.--This is the _C.
10136-8{_}15198{_}endivium_ of science, and is much used     as a salad.
10136-8{_}15199{_}It belongs to the family of the _Compositae_, with     Chicory, common Goats-beard, and others of the same genus.
10136-8{_}15200{_}Withering states, that before the stems of the common     Goats-beard shoot up the roots, boiled like asparagus, have the     same flavour, and are nearly as nutritious.
10136-8{_}15201{_}We are also informed     by Villars that the children in Dauphiné universally eat the     stems and leaves of the young plant before the flowers appear,     with great avidity.
10136-8{_}15202{_}The fresh juice of these tender herbs is     said to be the best solvent of bile.
10136-8{_}15203{_}STEWED ENDIVE.
10136-8{_}15204{_}1117.
10136-8{_}15205{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, salt and water, 1 pint of broth, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, a small lump of sugar.
10136-8{_}15206{_}_Mode_.--Wash and free the endive thoroughly from insects, remove the green part of the leaves, and put it into boiling water, slightly salted.
10136-8{_}15207{_}Let it remain for 10 minutes; then take it out, drain it till there is no water remaining, and chop it very fine.
10136-8{_}15208{_}Put it into a stewpan with the broth; add a little salt and a lump of sugar, and boil until the endive is perfectly tender.
10136-8{_}15209{_}When done, which may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between the thumb and finger, add a thickening of butter and flour and the lemon-juice: let the sauce boil up, and serve.
10136-8{_}15210{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer in the broth.
10136-8{_}15211{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15212{_}per head.
10136-8{_}15213{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}15214{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15215{_}ENDIVE A LA FRANCAISE.
10136-8{_}15216{_}1118.
10136-8{_}15217{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, 1 pint of broth, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}15218{_}of fresh butter; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.
10136-8{_}15219{_}_Mode_.--Wash and boil the endive as in the preceding recipe; chop it rather fine, and put into a stewpan with the broth; boil over a brisk fire until the sauce is all reduced; then put in the butter, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg (the latter must be very sparingly used); mix all well together, bring it to the boiling point, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15220{_}_Time_,--10 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer in the broth.
10136-8{_}15221{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15222{_}per head.
10136-8{_}15223{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.
10136-8{_}15224{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15225{_}TO BOIL HARICOTS BLANCS, or WHITE HARICOT BEANS.
10136-8{_}15226{_}1119.
10136-8{_}15227{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 2 quarts of soft water, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15228{_}of butter, 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15229{_}_Mode_.--Put the beans into cold water, and let them soak from 2 to 4 hours, according to their age; then put them into cold water, salted in the above proportion, bring them to boil, and let them simmer very slowly until tender; pour the water away from them, let them stand by the side of the fire, with the lid of the saucepan partially off, to allow the beans to dry; then add 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15230{_}of butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}15231{_}Shake the beans about for a minute or two, and serve: do not stir them with a spoon, for fear of breaking them to pieces.
10136-8{_}15232{_}_Time_.--After the water boils, from 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}15233{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}15234{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}15235{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15236{_}_Seasonable_ in winter, when other vegetables are scarce.
10136-8{_}15237{_}_Note_.--Haricots blancs, when new and fresh, should be put into boiling water, and do not require any soaking previous to dressing.
10136-8{_}15238{_}HARICOTS AND LENTILS.--Although these vegetables are not much     used in this country, yet in France, and other Catholic     countries, from their peculiar constituent properties, they form     an excellent substitute for animal food during Lent and _maigre_     days.
10136-8{_}15239{_}At the time of the prevalence of the Roman religion in     this country, they were probably much more generally used than     at present.
10136-8{_}15240{_}As reformations are often carried beyond necessity,     possibly lentils may have fallen into disuse, as an article of     diet amongst Protestants, for fear the use of them might be     considered a sign of popery.
10136-8{_}15241{_}HARICOTS BLANCS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.
10136-8{_}15242{_}1120.
10136-8{_}15243{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}15244{_}of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1/2 lemon.
10136-8{_}15245{_}[Illustration: HARICOT BEANS.]
10136-8{_}15246{_}_Mode_.--Should the beans be very dry, soak them for an hour or two in cold water, and boil them until perfectly tender, as in the preceding recipe.
10136-8{_}15247{_}If the water should boil away, replenish it with a little more cold, which makes the skin of the beans tender.
10136-8{_}15248{_}Let them be very thoroughly done; drain them well; then add to them the butter, minced parsley, and a seasoning of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}15249{_}Keep moving the stewpan over the fire without using a spoon, as this would break the beans; and, when the various ingredients are well mixed with them, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15250{_}_Time_.--From 2 to 2-1/2 hours to boil the beans.
10136-8{_}15251{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}15252{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}15253{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15254{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}15255{_}HARICOT BEANS.--This is the _haricot blanc_ of the French, and     is a native of India.
10136-8{_}15256{_}It ripens readily, in dry summers, in most     parts of Britain, but its culture has hitherto been confined to     gardens in England; but in Germany and Switzerland it is grown     in fields.
10136-8{_}15257{_}It is usually harvested by pulling up the plants,     which, being dried, are stacked and thrashed.
10136-8{_}15258{_}The haulm is both     of little bulk and little use, but the seed is used in making     the esteemed French dish called haricot, with which it were well     if the working classes of this country were acquainted.
10136-8{_}15259{_}There     is, perhaps, no other vegetable dish so cheap and easily cooked,     and, at the same time, so agreeable and nourishing.
10136-8{_}15260{_}The beans     are boiled, and then mixed with a little fat or salt butter, and     a little milk or water and flour.
10136-8{_}15261{_}From 3,840 parts of     kidney-bean Einholff obtained 1,805 parts of matter analogous to     starch, 351 of vegeto-animal matter, and 799 parts of mucilage.
10136-8{_}15262{_}HARICOT BEANS AND MINCED ONIONS.
10136-8{_}15263{_}1121.
10136-8{_}15264{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 4 middling-sized onions, 1/4 pint of good brown gravy, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour.
10136-8{_}15265{_}_Mode_.--Peel and mince the onions not too finely, and fry them in butter of a light brown colour; dredge over them a little flour, and add the gravy and a seasoning of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}15266{_}Have ready a pint of haricot beans well boiled and drained; put them with the onions and gravy, mix all well together, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15267{_}_Time_.--From 2 to 2-1/2 hours to boil the beans; 5 minutes to fry the onions.
10136-8{_}15268{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}15269{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}15270{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15271{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}15272{_}HORSERADISH.
10136-8{_}15273{_}1122.
10136-8{_}15274{_}This root, scraped, is always served with hot roast beef, and is used for garnishing many kinds of boiled fish.
10136-8{_}15275{_}Let the horseradish remain in cold water for an hour; wash it well, and with a sharp knife scrape it into very thin shreds, commencing from the thick end of the root.
10136-8{_}15276{_}Arrange some of it lightly in a small glass dish, and the remainder use for garnishing the joint: it should be placed in tufts round the border of the dish, with 1 or 2 bunches on the meat.
10136-8{_}15277{_}_Average cost_, 2d.
10136-8{_}15278{_}per stick.
10136-8{_}15279{_}_Seasonable_ from October to June.
10136-8{_}15280{_}[Illustration: HORSERADISH.]
10136-8{_}15281{_}THE HORSERADISH.--This belongs to the tribe _Alyssidae_, and is     highly stimulant and exciting to the stomach.
10136-8{_}15282{_}It has been     recommended in chronic rheumatism, palsy, dropsical complaints,     and in cases of enfeebled digestion.
10136-8{_}15283{_}Its principal use, however,     is as a condiment to promote appetite and excite the digestive     organs.
10136-8{_}15284{_}The horseradish contains sulphur to the extent of thirty     per cent, in the number of its elements; and it is to the     presence of this quality that the metal vessels in which the     radish is sometimes distilled, are turned into a black colour.
10136-8{_}15285{_}It is one of the most powerful excitants and antiscorbutics we     have, and forms the basis of several medical preparations, in     the form of wines, tinctures, and syrups.
10136-8{_}15286{_}LETTUCES.
10136-8{_}15287{_}1123.
10136-8{_}15288{_}These form one of the principal ingredients to summer salads; should be nicely blanched, and be eaten young.
10136-8{_}15289{_}They are seldom served in any other way, but may be stewed and sent to table in a good brown gravy flavoured with lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15290{_}In preparing them for a salad, carefully wash them free from dirt, pick off all the decayed and outer leaves, and dry them thoroughly by shaking them in a cloth.
10136-8{_}15291{_}Cut off the stalks, and either halve or cut the lettuces into small pieces.
10136-8{_}15292{_}The manner of cutting them up entirely depends on the salad for which they are intended.
10136-8{_}15293{_}In France the lettuces are sometimes merely wiped with a cloth and not washed, the cooks there declaring that the act of washing them injuriously affects the pleasant crispness of the plant: in this case scrupulous attention must be paid to each leaf, and the grit thoroughly wiped away.
10136-8{_}15294{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 1d.
10136-8{_}15295{_}each.
10136-8{_}15296{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 lettuces for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15297{_}_Seasonable_ from March to the end of August, but may be had all the year.
10136-8{_}15298{_}[Illustration: LETTUCE.]
10136-8{_}15299{_}THE LETTUCE.--All the varieties of the garden lettuce have     originated from the _Lactuca sativa_ of science, which has never     yet been found in a wild state.
10136-8{_}15300{_}Hence it may be concluded that     it is merely another form of some species, changed through the     effects of cultivation.
10136-8{_}15301{_}In its young state, the lettuce forms a     well-known and wholesome salad, containing a bland pellucid     juice, with little taste or smell, and having a cooling and     soothing influence on the system.
10136-8{_}15302{_}This arises from the large     quantities of water and mucilage it contains, and not from any     narcotic principle which it is supposed to possess.
10136-8{_}15303{_}During the     period of flowering, it abounds in a peculiar milky juice, which     flows from the stem when wounded, and which has been found to be     possessed of decided medicinal properties.
10136-8{_}15304{_}BAKED MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}15305{_}(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)
10136-8{_}15306{_}1124.
10136-8{_}15307{_}INGREDIENTS.--16 to 20 mushroom-flaps, butter, pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}15308{_}_Mode_.--For this mode of cooking, the mushroom flaps are better than the buttons, and should not be too large.
10136-8{_}15309{_}Cut off a portion of the stalk, peel the top, and wipe the mushrooms carefully with a piece of flannel and a little fine salt.
10136-8{_}15310{_}Put them into a tin baking-dish, with a very small piece of butter placed on each mushroom; sprinkle over a little pepper, and let them bake for about 20 minutes, or longer should the mushrooms be very large.
10136-8{_}15311{_}Have ready a _very hot_ dish, pile the mushrooms high in the centre, pour the gravy round, and send them to table quickly, with very _hot_ plates.
10136-8{_}15312{_}_Time_.--20 minutes; large mushrooms, 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15313{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15314{_}each for large mushroom-flaps.
10136-8{_}15315{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15316{_}_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated mushrooms may be had at any time.
10136-8{_}15317{_}FUNGI.--These are common parasitical plants, originating in the     production of copious filamentous threads, called the mycelium,     or spawn.
10136-8{_}15318{_}Rounded tubers appear on the mycelium; some of these     enlarge rapidly, burst an outer covering, which is left at the     base, and protrude a thick stalk, bearing at its summit a     rounded body, which in a short time expands into the pileus or     cap.
10136-8{_}15319{_}The gills, which occupy its lower surface, consist of     parallel plates, bearing naked sporules over their whole     surface.
10136-8{_}15320{_}Some of the cells, which are visible by the microscope,     produce four small cells at their free summit, apparently by     germination and constriction.
10136-8{_}15321{_}These are the sporules, and this     is the development of the Agarics.
10136-8{_}15322{_}BROILED MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}15323{_}(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)
10136-8{_}15324{_}1125.
10136-8{_}15325{_}INGREDIENTS.--Mushroom-flaps, pepper and salt to taste, butter, lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15326{_}[Illustration: BROILED MUSHROOMS.]
10136-8{_}15327{_}_Mode_.--Cleanse the mushrooms by wiping them with a piece of flannel and a little salt; cut off a portion of the stalk, and peel the tops: broil them over a clear fire, turning them once, and arrange them on a very hot dish.
10136-8{_}15328{_}Put a small piece of butter on each mushroom, season with pepper and salt, and squeeze over them a few drops of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15329{_}Place the dish before the fire, and when the butter is melted, serve very hot and quickly.
10136-8{_}15330{_}Moderate-sized flaps are better suited to this mode of cooking than the buttons: the latter are better in stews.
10136-8{_}15331{_}_Time_.--10 minutes for medium-sized mushrooms.
10136-8{_}15332{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15333{_}each for large mushrooms.
10136-8{_}15334{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 3 or 4 mushrooms to each person.
10136-8{_}15335{_}_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated mushrooms may be had at any time.
10136-8{_}15336{_}[Illustration: MUSHROOMS.]
10136-8{_}15337{_}VARIETIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--The common mushroom found in our     pastures is the _Agaricus campestris_ of science, and another     edible British species is _A.
10136-8{_}15338{_}Georgii;_ but _A.
10136-8{_}15339{_}primulus_ is     affirmed to be the most delicious mushroom.
10136-8{_}15340{_}The morel is     _Morchella esculenta_, and _Tuber cibarium_ is the common     truffle.
10136-8{_}15341{_}There is in New Zealand a long fungus, which grows from     the head of a caterpillar, and which forms a horn, as it were,     and is called _Sphaeria Robertsii_.
10136-8{_}15342{_}TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}15343{_}1126.
10136-8{_}15344{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each quart of mushrooms, allow 3 oz.
10136-8{_}15345{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1 lemon, clarified butter.
10136-8{_}15346{_}_Mode_.--Peel the mushrooms, put them into cold water, with a little lemon-juice; take them out and _dry_ them very carefully in a cloth.
10136-8{_}15347{_}Put the butter into a stewpan capable of holding the mushrooms; when it is melted, add the mushrooms, lemon-juice, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; draw them down over a slow fire, and let them remain until their liquor is boiled away, and they have become quite dry, but be careful in not allowing them to stick to the bottom of the stewpan.
10136-8{_}15348{_}When done, put them into pots, and pour over the top clarified butter.
10136-8{_}15349{_}If wanted for immediate use, they will keep good a few days without being covered over.
10136-8{_}15350{_}To re-warm them, put the mushrooms into a stewpan, strain the butter from them, and they will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}15351{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15352{_}each.
10136-8{_}15353{_}_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated mushrooms may be had at any time.
10136-8{_}15354{_}LOCALITIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--Mushrooms are to be met with in     pastures, woods, and marshes, but are very capricious and     uncertain in their places of growth, multitudes being obtained     in one season where few or none were to be found in the     preceding.
10136-8{_}15355{_}They sometimes grow solitary, but more frequently     they are gregarious, and rise in a regular circular form.
10136-8{_}15356{_}Many     species are employed by man as food; but, generally speaking,     they are difficult of digestion, and by no means very     nourishing.
10136-8{_}15357{_}Many of them are also of suspicious qualities.
10136-8{_}15358{_}Little reliance can be placed either on their taste, smell, or     colour, as much depends on the situation in which they vegetate;     and even the same plant, it is affirmed, may be innocent when     young, but become noxious when advanced in age.
10136-8{_}15359{_}STEWED MUSHROOMS.
10136-8{_}15360{_}1127.
10136-8{_}15361{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint mushroom-buttons, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}15362{_}of fresh butter, white pepper and salt to taste, lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful of flour, cream or milk, 1 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}15363{_}_Mode_.--Cut off the ends of the stalks, and pare neatly a pint of mushroom-buttons; put them into a basin of water, with a little lemon-juice, as they are done.
10136-8{_}15364{_}When all are prepared, take them from the water with the hands, to avoid the sediment, and put them into a stewpan with the fresh butter, white pepper, salt, and the juice of 1/2 lemon; cover the pan closely, and let the mushrooms stew gently from 20 to 25 minutes; then thicken the butter with the above proportion of flour, add gradually sufficient cream, or cream and milk, to make the sauce of a proper consistency, and put in the grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}15365{_}If the mushrooms are not perfectly tender, stew them for 5 minutes longer, remove every particle of butter which may be floating on the top, and serve.
10136-8{_}15366{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15367{_}_Average cost_, from 9d.
10136-8{_}15368{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}15369{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}15370{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15371{_}_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October.
10136-8{_}15372{_}TO PROCURE MUSHROOMS.--In order to obtain mushrooms at all     seasons, several methods of propagation have been had recourse     to.
10136-8{_}15373{_}It is said that, in some parts of Italy, a species of stone     is used for this purpose, which is described as being of two     different kinds; the one is found in the chalk hills near     Naples, and has a white, porous, stalactical appearance; the     other is a hardened turf from some volcanic mountains near     Florence.
10136-8{_}15374{_}These stones are kept in cellars, and occasionally     moistened with water which has been used in the washing of     mushrooms, and are thus supplied with their minute seeds.
10136-8{_}15375{_}In     this country, gardeners provide themselves with what is called     _spawn_, either from the old manure of cucumber-beds, or     purchase it from those whose business it is to propagate it.
10136-8{_}15376{_}When thus procured, it is usually made up for sale in quadrils,     consisting of numerous white fibrous roots, having a strong     smell of mushrooms.
10136-8{_}15377{_}This is planted in rows, in a dry situation,     and carefully attended to for five or six weeks, when the bed     begins to produce, and continues to do so for several months.
10136-8{_}15378{_}STEWED MUSHROOMS IN GRAVY.
10136-8{_}15379{_}1128.
10136-8{_}15380{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, 1 pint of brown gravy No.
10136-8{_}15381{_}436, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}15382{_}_Mode_.--Make a pint of brown gravy by recipe 436; cut nearly all the stalks away from the mushrooms and peel the tops; put them into a stewpan, with the gravy, and simmer them gently from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15383{_}Add the nutmeg and a seasoning of cayenne and salt, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15384{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15385{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}15386{_}to 2s.
10136-8{_}15387{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}15388{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15389{_}_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October.
10136-8{_}15390{_}ANALYSIS OF FUNGI.--The fungi have been examined chemically with     much care, both by MM.
10136-8{_}15391{_}Bracannot and Vauquelin, who designate     the insoluble spongy matter by the name of fungin, and the     soluble portion is found to contain the bolotic and the fungic     acids.
10136-8{_}15392{_}BAKED SPANISH ONIONS.
10136-8{_}15393{_}1129.
10136-8{_}15394{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 Spanish onions, salt, and water.
10136-8{_}15395{_}_Mode_.--Put the onions, with their skins on, into a saucepan of boiling water slightly salted, and let them boil quickly for an hour.
10136-8{_}15396{_}Then take them out, wipe them thoroughly, wrap each one in a piece of paper separately, and bake them in a moderate oven for 2 hours, or longer, should the onions be very large.
10136-8{_}15397{_}They may be served in their skins, and eaten with a piece of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt; or they may be peeled, and a good brown gravy poured over them.
10136-8{_}15398{_}_Time_.--1 hour to boil, 2 hours to bake.
10136-8{_}15399{_}_Average cost_, medium-sized, 2d.
10136-8{_}15400{_}each.
10136-8{_}15401{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15402{_}_Seasonable_ from September to January.
10136-8{_}15403{_}[Illustration: ONION.]
10136-8{_}15404{_}THE GENUS ALLIUM.--The Onion, like the Leek, Garlic, and Shalot,     belongs to the genus _Allium_, which is a numerous species of     vegetable; and every one of them possesses, more or less, a     volatile and acrid penetrating principle, pricking the thin     transparent membrane of the eyelids; and all are very similar in     their properties.
10136-8{_}15405{_}In the whole of them the bulb is the most     active part, and any one of them may supply the place of the     other; for they are all irritant, excitant, and vesicant.
10136-8{_}15406{_}With     many, the onion is a very great favourite, and is considered an     extremely nutritive vegetable.
10136-8{_}15407{_}The Spanish kind is frequently     taken for supper, it being simply boiled, and then seasoned with     salt, pepper, and butter.
10136-8{_}15408{_}Some dredge on a little flour, but     many prefer it without this.
10136-8{_}15409{_}BURNT ONIONS FOR GRAVIES.
10136-8{_}15410{_}1130.
10136-8{_}15411{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}15412{_}of onions, 1/3 pint of water, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}15413{_}of moist sugar, 1/3 pint of vinegar.
10136-8{_}15414{_}_Mode_.--Peel and chop the onions fine, and put them into a stewpan (not tinned), with the water; let them boil for 5 minutes, then add the sugar, and simmer gently until the mixture becomes nearly black and throws out bubbles of smoke.
10136-8{_}15415{_}Have ready the above proportion of boiling vinegar, strain the liquor gradually to it, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well incorporated.
10136-8{_}15416{_}When cold, bottle for use.
10136-8{_}15417{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour.
10136-8{_}15418{_}PROPERTIES OF THE ONION.--The onion is possessed of a white,     acrid, volatile oil, holding sulphur in solution, albumen, a     good deal of uncrystallizable sugar and mucilage; phosphoric     acid, both free and combined with lime; acetic acid, citrate of     lime, and lignine.
10136-8{_}15419{_}Of all the species of allium, the onion has     the volatile principle in the greatest degree; and hence it is     impossible to separate the scales of the root without the eyes     being affected.
10136-8{_}15420{_}The juice is sensibly acid, and is capable of     being, by fermentation, converted into vinegar, and, mixed with     water or the dregs of beer, yields, by distillation, an     alcoholic liquor.
10136-8{_}15421{_}Although used as a common esculent, onions are     not suited to all stomachs; there are some who cannot eat them     either fried or roasted, whilst others prefer them boiled, which     is the best way of using them, as, by the process they then     undergo, they are deprived of their essential oil.
10136-8{_}15422{_}The pulp of     roasted onions, with oil, forms an excellent anodyne and     emollient poultice to suppurating tumours.
10136-8{_}15423{_}STEWED SPANISH ONIONS.
10136-8{_}15424{_}1131--INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 Spanish onions, 1 pint of good broth or gravy.
10136-8{_}15425{_}_Mode_.--Peel the onions, taking care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails, or they would then fall to pieces; put them into a stewpan capable of holding them at the bottom without piling them one on the top of another; add the broth or gravy, and simmer _very gently_ until the onions are perfectly tender.
10136-8{_}15426{_}Dish them, pour the gravy round, and serve.
10136-8{_}15427{_}Instead of using broth, Spanish onions may be stewed with a large piece of butter: they must be done very gradually over a slow fire or hot-plate, and will produce plenty of gravy.
10136-8{_}15428{_}_Time_.--To stew in gravy, 2 hours, or longer if very large.
10136-8{_}15429{_}_Average cost_.--medium-sized, 2d.
10136-8{_}15430{_}each.
10136-8{_}15431{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}15432{_}_Seasonable_ from September to January.
10136-8{_}15433{_}_Note_.--Stewed Spanish onions are a favourite accompaniment to roast shoulder of mutton.
10136-8{_}15434{_}ORIGIN OF THE ONION.--This vegetable is thought to have     originally come from India, through Egypt, where it became an     object of worship.
10136-8{_}15435{_}Thence it was transmitted to Greece, thence     to Italy, and ultimately it was distributed throughout Europe,     in almost every part of which it has, from time immemorial, been     cultivated.
10136-8{_}15436{_}In warm climates it is found to be less acrid and     much sweeter than in colder latitudes; and in Spain it is not at     all unusual to see a peasant munching an onion, as an Englishman     would an apple.
10136-8{_}15437{_}Spanish onions, which are imported to this     country during the winter months, are, when properly roasted,     perfectly sweet, and equal to many preserves.
10136-8{_}15438{_}BOILED PARSNIPS.
10136-8{_}15439{_}1132.
10136-8{_}15440{_}INGREDIENTS.--Parsnips; to each gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15441{_}_Mode_.--Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and, with the point of the knife, remove any black specks about them, and, should they be very large, cut the thick part into quarters.
10136-8{_}15442{_}Put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork in them; take them up, drain them, and serve in a vegetable-dish.
10136-8{_}15443{_}This vegetable is usually served with salt fish, boiled pork, or boiled beef: when sent to table with the latter, a few should be placed alternately with carrots round the dish, as a garnish.
10136-8{_}15444{_}_Time_.--Large parsnips, 1 to 1-1/2 hour; small ones, 1/2 to 1 hour.
10136-8{_}15445{_}_Average cost_, 1d.
10136-8{_}15446{_}each.
10136-8{_}15447{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 for each person.
10136-8{_}15448{_}_Seasonable_ from October to May.
10136-8{_}15449{_}[Illustration: THE PARSNIP.]
10136-8{_}15450{_}THE PARSNIP.--This vegetable is found wild in meadows all over     Europe, and, in England, is met with very frequently on dry     banks in a chalky soil.
10136-8{_}15451{_}In its wild state, the root is white,     mucilaginous, aromatic, and sweet, with some degree of acrimony:     when old, it has been known to cause vertigo.
10136-8{_}15452{_}Willis relates     that a whole family fell into delirium from having eaten of its     roots, and cattle never touch it in its wild state.
10136-8{_}15453{_}In domestic     economy the parsnip is much used, and is found to be a highly     nutritious vegetable.
10136-8{_}15454{_}In times of scarcity, an excellent bread     has been made from the roots, and they also furnish an excellent     wine, resembling the malmsey of Madeira and the Canaries: a     spirit is also obtained from them in as great quantities as from     carrots.
10136-8{_}15455{_}The composition of the parsnip-root has been found to     be 79.4 of water, 0.9 starch and fibre, 6.1 gum, 5.5 sugar, and     2.1 of albumen.
10136-8{_}15456{_}BOILED GREEN PEAS.
10136-8{_}15457{_}1133.
10136-8{_}15458{_}INGREDIENTS.--Green peas; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 _small_ teaspoonful of moist sugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15459{_}_Mode_.--This delicious vegetable, to be eaten in perfection, should be young, and not _gathered_ or _shelled_ long before it is dressed.
10136-8{_}15460{_}Shell the peas, wash them well in cold water, and drain them; then put them into a saucepan with plenty of _fast-boiling_ water, to which salt and _moist sugar_ have been added in the above proportion; let them boil quickly over a brisk fire, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and be careful that the smoke does not draw in.
10136-8{_}15461{_}When tender, pour them into a colander; put them into a hot vegetable-dish, and quite in the centre of the peas place a piece of butter, the size of a walnut.
10136-8{_}15462{_}Many cooks boil a small bunch of mint _with_ the _peas_, or garnish them with it, by boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves.
10136-8{_}15463{_}Should the peas be very old, and difficult to boil a good colour, a very tiny piece of soda may be thrown in the water previous to putting them in; but this must be very sparingly used, as it causes the peas, when boiled, to have a smashed and broken appearance.
10136-8{_}15464{_}With young peas, there is not the slightest occasion to use it.
10136-8{_}15465{_}_Time_.--Young peas, 10 to 15 minutes; the large sorts, such as marrowfats, &c., 18 to 24 minutes; old peas, 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15466{_}_Average cost_, when cheapest, 6d.
10136-8{_}15467{_}per peck; when first in season, 1s.
10136-8{_}15468{_}to 1s.
10136-8{_}15469{_}6d.
10136-8{_}15470{_}per peck.
10136-8{_}15471{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 peck of unshelled peas for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15472{_}_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.
10136-8{_}15473{_}ORIGIN OF THE PEA.--All the varieties of garden peas which are     cultivated have originated from the _Pisum sativum_, a native of     the south of Europe; and field peas are varieties of _Pisum     arvense_.
10136-8{_}15474{_}The Everlasting Pea is _Lathyrus latifolius_, an old     favourite in flower-gardens.
10136-8{_}15475{_}It is said to yield an abundance of     honey to bees, which are remarkably fond of it.
10136-8{_}15476{_}In this country     the pea has been grown from time immemorial; but its culture     seems to have diminished since the more general introduction of     herbage, plants, and roots.
10136-8{_}15477{_}GREEN PEAS A LA FRANCAISE.
10136-8{_}15478{_}1134.
10136-8{_}15479{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of green peas, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}15480{_}of fresh butter, a bunch of parsley, 6 green onions, flour, a small lump of sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of flour.
10136-8{_}15481{_}_Mode_.--Shell sufficient fresh-gathered peas to fill 2 quarts; put them into cold water, with the above proportion of butter, and stir them about until they are well covered with the butter; drain them in a colander, and put them in a stewpan, with the parsley and onions; dredge over them a little flour, stir the peas well, and moisten them with boiling water; boil them quickly over a large fire for 20 minutes, or until there is no liquor remaining.
10136-8{_}15482{_}Dip a small lump of sugar into some water, that it may soon melt; put it with the peas, to which add 1/2 teaspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15483{_}Take a piece of butter the size of a walnut, work it together with a teaspoonful of flour; and add this to the peas, which should be boiling when it is put in.
10136-8{_}15484{_}Keep shaking the stewpan, and, when the peas are nicely thickened, dress them high in the dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}15485{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}15486{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}15487{_}per peck.
10136-8{_}15488{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15489{_}_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.
10136-8{_}15490{_}VARIETIES OF THE PEA.--The varieties of the Pea are numerous;     but they may be divided into two classes--those grown for the     ripened seed, and those grown for gathering in a green state.
10136-8{_}15491{_}The culture of the latter is chiefly confined to the     neighbourhoods of large towns, and may be considered as in part     rather to belong to the operations of the gardener than to those     of the agriculturist.
10136-8{_}15492{_}The grey varieties are the early grey, the     late grey, and the purple grey; to which some add the     Marlborough grey and the horn grey.
10136-8{_}15493{_}The white varieties grown in     fields are the pearl, early Charlton, golden hotspur, the common     white, or Suffolk, and other Suffolk varieties.
10136-8{_}15494{_}STEWED GREEN PEAS.
10136-8{_}15495{_}1135.
10136-8{_}15496{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of peas, 1 Lettuce, 1 onion, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}15497{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
10136-8{_}15498{_}_Mode_.--Shell the peas, and cut the onion and lettuce into slices; put these into a stewpan, with the butter, pepper, and salt, but with no more water than that which hangs round the lettuce from washing.
10136-8{_}15499{_}Stew the whole very gently for rather more than 1 hour; then stir to it a well-beaten egg, and about 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
10136-8{_}15500{_}When the peas, &c., are nicely thickened, serve but, after the egg is added, do not allow them to boil.
10136-8{_}15501{_}_Time_.--1-1/4 hour.

10136-8{_}15507{_}THE SWEET-PEA AND THE HEATH OR WOOD-PEA.--The well-known     sweet-pea forms a fine covering to a trellis, or lattice-work in     a flower-garden.
10136-8{_}15508{_}Its gay and fragrant flowers, with its rambling     habit, render it peculiarly adapted for such a purpose.
10136-8{_}15509{_}The     wood-pea, or heath-pea, is found in the heaths of Scotland, and     the Highlanders of that country are extremely partial to them,     and dry and chew them to give a greater relish to their whiskey.
10136-8{_}15510{_}They also regard them as good against chest complaints, and say     that by the use of them they are enabled to withstand hunger and     thirst for a long time.
10136-8{_}15511{_}The peas have a sweet taste, somewhat     like the root of liquorice, and, when boiled, have an agreeable     flavour, and are nutritive.
10136-8{_}15512{_}In times of scarcity they have     served as an article of food.
10136-8{_}15513{_}When well boiled, a fork will pass     through them; and, slightly dried, they are roasted, and in     Holland and Flanders served up like chestnuts.
10136-8{_}15514{_}BAKED POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15515{_}1136.
10136-8{_}15516{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes.
10136-8{_}15517{_}[Illustration: BAKED POTATOES SERVED IN NAPKIN.]
10136-8{_}15518{_}_Mode_.--Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as possible; wash them in lukewarm water, and scrub them well, for the browned skin of a baked potato is by many persons considered the better part of it.
10136-8{_}15519{_}Put them into a moderate oven, and bake them for about 2 hours, turning them three or four times whilst they are cooking.
10136-8{_}15520{_}Serve them in a napkin immediately they are done, as, if kept a long time in the oven, they have a shrivelled appearance.
10136-8{_}15521{_}Potatoes may also be roasted before the fire, in an American oven; but when thus cooked, they must be done very slowly.
10136-8{_}15522{_}Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold butter.
10136-8{_}15523{_}_Time_.--Large potatoes, in a hot oven 1-1/2 hour to 2 hours; in a cool oven, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}15524{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15525{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15526{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 to each person.
10136-8{_}15527{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season.
10136-8{_}15528{_}POTATO-SUGAR.--This sugary substance, found in the tubers of     potatoes, is obtained in the form of syrup or treacle, and has     not yet been crystallized.
10136-8{_}15529{_}It resembles the sugar of grapes,     has a very sweet taste, and may be used for making sweetmeats,     and as a substitute for honey.
10136-8{_}15530{_}Sixty pounds of potatoes,     yielding eight pounds of dry starch, will produce seven and a     half pounds of sugar.
10136-8{_}15531{_}In Russia it is extensively made, as     good, though of less consistency than the treacle obtained from     cane-sugar.
10136-8{_}15532{_}A spirit is also distilled from the tubers, which     resembles brandy, but is milder, and has a flavour as if it were     charged with the odour of violets or raspberries.
10136-8{_}15533{_}In France     this manufacture is carried on pretty extensively, and five     hundred pounds of the tubers will produce twelve quarts of     spirit, the pulp being given to cattle.
10136-8{_}15534{_}TO BOIL POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15535{_}1137.
10136-8{_}15536{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15537{_}_Mode_.--Choose potatoes of an equal size, pare them, take out all the eyes and specks, and as they are peeled, throw them into cold water.
10136-8{_}15538{_}Put them into a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, with salt in the above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender.
10136-8{_}15539{_}Ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, and take them up the moment they feel soft through; for if they are left in the water afterwards, they become waxy or watery.
10136-8{_}15540{_}Drain away the water, put the saucepan by the side of the fire, with the lid partially uncovered, to allow the steam to escape, and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry, and do not allow them to get burnt.
10136-8{_}15541{_}Their superfluous moisture will evaporate, and the potatoes, if a good sort, should be perfectly mealy and dry.
10136-8{_}15542{_}Potatoes vary so much in quality and size, that it is difficult to give the exact time for boiling; they should be attentively watched, and probed with a fork, to ascertain when they are cooked.
10136-8{_}15543{_}Send them to table quickly, and very hot, and with an opening in the cover of the dish, that a portion of the steam may evaporate, and not fall back on the potatoes.
10136-8{_}15544{_}_Time_.--Moderate-sized old potatoes, 15 to 20 minutes after the water boils; large ones, 1/2 hour to 35 minutes.
10136-8{_}15545{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15546{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15547{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15548{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season.
10136-8{_}15549{_}_Note_.--To keep potatoes hot, after draining the water from them, put a folded cloth or flannel (kept for the purpose) on the top of them, keeping the saucepan-lid partially uncovered.
10136-8{_}15550{_}This will absorb the moisture, and keep them hot some time without spoiling.
10136-8{_}15551{_}THE POTATO.--The potato belongs to the family of the     _Solanaceae_, the greater number of which inhabit the tropics,     and the remainder are distributed over the temperate regions of     both hemispheres, but do not extend to the arctic and antarctic     zones.
10136-8{_}15552{_}The whole of the family are suspicious; a great number     are narcotic, and many are deleterious.
10136-8{_}15553{_}The roots partake of the     properties of the plants, and are sometimes even more active.
10136-8{_}15554{_}The tubercles of such as produce them, are amylaceous and     nutritive, as in those of the potato.
10136-8{_}15555{_}The leaves are generally     narcotic; but they lose this principle in boiling, as is the     case with the _Solanum nigrum_, which are used as a vegetable     when cooked.
10136-8{_}15556{_}TO BOIL POTATOES IN THEIR JACKETS.
10136-8{_}15557{_}1138.
10136-8{_}15558{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15559{_}_Mode_.--To obtain this wholesome and delicious vegetable cooked in perfection, it should be boiled and sent to table with the skin on.
10136-8{_}15560{_}In Ireland, where, perhaps, the cooking of potatoes is better understood than in any country, they are always served so.
10136-8{_}15561{_}Wash the potatoes well, and if necessary, use a clean scrubbing-brush to remove the dirt from them; and if possible, choose the potatoes so that they may all be as nearly the same size as possible.
10136-8{_}15562{_}When thoroughly cleansed, fill the saucepan half full with them, and just cover the potatoes with cold water, salted in the above proportion: they are more quickly boiled with a small quantity of water, and, besides, are more savoury than when drowned in it.
10136-8{_}15563{_}Bring them to boil, then draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let them simmer gently until tender.
10136-8{_}15564{_}Ascertain when they are done by probing them with a fork; then pour off the water, uncover the saucepan, and let the potatoes dry by the side of the fire, taking care not to let them burn.
10136-8{_}15565{_}Peel them quickly, put them in a very hot vegetable-dish, either with or without a napkin, and serve very quickly.
10136-8{_}15566{_}After potatoes are cooked, they should never be entirely covered up, as the steam, instead of escaping, falls down on them, and makes them watery and insipid.
10136-8{_}15567{_}In Ireland they are usually served up with the skins on, and a small plate is placed by the side of each guest.
10136-8{_}15568{_}_Time_.--Moderate-sized potatoes, with their skins on, 20 to 25 minutes after the water boils; large potatoes, 25 minutes to 3/4 hour, or longer; 5 minutes to dry them.
10136-8{_}15569{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15570{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15571{_}Sufficient for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15572{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season.
10136-8{_}15573{_}ANALYSIS OF THE POTATO.--Next to the cereals, the potato is the     most valuable plant for the production of human food.
10136-8{_}15574{_}Its     tubers, according to analysis conducted by Mr. Fromberg, in the     laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Scotland,     contain the following ingredients:--75.52 per cent.
10136-8{_}15575{_}of water,     15.72 starch, O.55 dextrine, 3.3 of impure saccharine matter,     and 3.25 of fibre with coagulated albumen.
10136-8{_}15576{_}In a dried state the     tuber contains 64.2 per cent, of starch, 2.25 of dextrine, 13.47     of impure saccharine matter, 5.77 of caseine, gluten, and     albumen, 1 of fatty matter, and 13.31 of fibre with coagulated     albumen.
10136-8{_}15577{_}TO BOIL NEW POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15578{_}1139.
10136-8{_}15579{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15580{_}_Mode_.--Do not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed, as they are never good when they have been out of the ground some time.
10136-8{_}15581{_}Well wash them, rub off the skins with a coarse cloth, and put them into _boiling_ water salted in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}15582{_}Let them boil until tender; try them with a fork, and when done, pour the water away from them; let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of the saucepan partially uncovered, and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry, put them into a hot vegetable-dish, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut; pile the potatoes over this, and serve.
10136-8{_}15583{_}If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off, boil them in their jackets; drain, peel, and serve them as above, with a piece of butter placed in the midst of them.
10136-8{_}15584{_}_Time_.--1/4 to 1/2 hour, according to the size.
10136-8{_}15585{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1d.
10136-8{_}15586{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}15587{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}15588{_}for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15589{_}_Seasonable_ in May and June, but may be had, forced, in March.
10136-8{_}15590{_}POTATO STARCH.--This fecula has a beautiful white crystalline     appearance, and is inodorous, soft to the touch, insoluble in     cold, but readily soluble in boiling water.
10136-8{_}15591{_}It is on this starch     that the nutritive properties of the tubers depend.
10136-8{_}15592{_}As an     aliment, it is well adapted for invalids and persons of delicate     constitution.
10136-8{_}15593{_}It may be used in the form of arrow-root, and     eaten with milk or sugar.
10136-8{_}15594{_}For pastry of all kinds it is more     light and easier of digestion than that made with flour of     wheat.
10136-8{_}15595{_}In confectionery it serves to form creams and jellies,     and in cookery may be used to thicken soups and sauces.
10136-8{_}15596{_}It     accommodates itself to the chest and stomach of children, for     whom it is well adapted; and it is an aliment that cannot be too     generally used, as much on account of its wholesomeness as its     cheapness, and the ease with which it is kept, which are equal,     if not superior, to all the much-vaunted exotic feculae; as,     salep, tapioca, sago, and arrow-root.
10136-8{_}15597{_}TO STEAM POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15598{_}1140.
10136-8{_}15599{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; boiling water.
10136-8{_}15600{_}_Mode_.--This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue, particularly where they are wanted on a large scale, it being so very convenient.
10136-8{_}15601{_}Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water as they are peeled, then put them into a steamer.
10136-8{_}15602{_}Place the steamer over a saucepan of boiling water, and steam the potatoes from 20 to 40 minutes, according to the size and sort.
10136-8{_}15603{_}When a fork goes easily through them, they are done; then take them up, dish, and serve very quickly.
10136-8{_}15604{_}_Time_.--20 to 40 minutes.
10136-8{_}15605{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15606{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15607{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 large potatoes to each person.
10136-8{_}15608{_}_Seasonable_ all the year, but not so good whilst new potatoes are in season.
10136-8{_}15609{_}USES OF THE POTATO.--Potatoes boiled and beaten along with sour     milk form a sort of cheese, which is made in Saxony; and, when     kept in close vessels, may be preserved for several years.
10136-8{_}15610{_}It is     generally supposed that the water in which potatoes are boiled     is injurious; and as instances are recorded where cattle having     drunk it were seriously affected, it may be well to err on the     safe side, and avoid its use for any alimentary purpose.
10136-8{_}15611{_}Potatoes which have been exposed to the air and become green,     are very unwholesome.
10136-8{_}15612{_}Cadet de Vaux asserts that potatoes will     clean linen as well as soap; and it is well known that the     berries of the _S.
10136-8{_}15613{_}saponaceum_ are used in Peru for the same     purpose.
10136-8{_}15614{_}HOW TO USE COLD POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15615{_}1141.
10136-8{_}15616{_}INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold potatoes; to every lb.
10136-8{_}15617{_}allow 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 ditto of minced onions, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15618{_}of butter, milk.
10136-8{_}15619{_}_Mode_.--Mash the potatoes with a fork until perfectly free from lumps; stir in the other ingredients, and add sufficient milk to moisten them well; press the potatoes into a mould, and bake in a moderate oven until nicely brown, which will be in from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15620{_}Turn them out of the mould, and serve.
10136-8{_}15621{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}15622{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15623{_}POTATO BREAD.--The manner in which this is made is very simple.
10136-8{_}15624{_}The adhesive tendency of the flour of the potato acts against     its being baked or kneaded without being mixed with wheaten     flour or meal; it may, however, be made into cakes in the     following manner:--A small wooden frame, nearly square, is laid     on a pan like a frying-pan and is grooved, and so constructed     that, by means of a presser or lid introduced into the groove,     the cake is at once fashioned, according to the dimensions of     the mould.
10136-8{_}15625{_}The frame containing the farina may be almost     immediately withdrawn after the mould is formed upon the pan;     because, from the consistency imparted to the incipient cake by     the heat, it will speedily admit of being safely handled: it     must not, however, be fried too hastily.
10136-8{_}15626{_}It will then eat very     palatably, and might from time to time be soaked for puddings,     like tapioca, or might be used like the cassada-cake, for, when     well buttered and toasted, it will be found an excellent     accompaniment to breakfast.
10136-8{_}15627{_}In Scotland, cold boiled potatoes     are frequently squeezed up and mixed with flour or oatmeal, and     an excellent cake, or _scon_, obtained.
10136-8{_}15628{_}FRIED POTATOES (French Fashion).
10136-8{_}15629{_}1142.
10136-8{_}15630{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, hot butter or clarified dripping, salt.
10136-8{_}15631{_}_Mode_.--Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as nearly the same size as possible; make some butter or dripping quite hot in a frying-pan; put in the potatoes, and fry them on both sides of a nice brown.
10136-8{_}15632{_}When they are crisp and done, take them up, place them on a cloth before the fire to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, after sprinkling them with salt.
10136-8{_}15633{_}These are delicious with rump-steak, and, in France, are frequently served thus as a breakfast dish.
10136-8{_}15634{_}The remains of cold potatoes may also be sliced and fried by the above recipe, but the slices must be cut a little thicker.
10136-8{_}15635{_}_Time_.--Sliced raw potatoes, 5 minutes; cooked potatoes, 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}15636{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15637{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15638{_}_Sufficient_,--6 sliced potatoes for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}15639{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15640{_}A GERMAN METHOD OF COOKING POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15641{_}1143.
10136-8{_}15642{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 to 10 middling-sized potatoes, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}15643{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1/2 pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.
10136-8{_}15644{_}_Mode_.--Put the butter and flour into a stewpan; stir over the fire until the butter is of a nice brown colour, and add the broth and vinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into long thin slices, lay them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently until tender, which will be in from 10 to 15 minutes, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15645{_}A laurel-leaf simmered with the potatoes is an improvement.
10136-8{_}15646{_}_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}15647{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15648{_}PRESERVING POTATOES.--In general, potatoes are stored or     preserved in pits, cellars, pies, or camps; but, whatever mode     is adopted, it is essential that the tubers be perfectly dry;     otherwise, they will surely rot; and a few rotten potatoes will     contaminate a whole mass.
10136-8{_}15649{_}The pie, as it is called, consists of     a trench, lined and covered with straw; the potatoes in it being     piled in the shape of a house roof, to the height of about three     feet.
10136-8{_}15650{_}The camps are shallow pits, filled and ridged up in a     similar manner, covered up with the excavated mould of the pit.
10136-8{_}15651{_}In Russia and Canada, the potato is preserved in boxes, in     houses or cellars, heated, when necessary, to a temperature one     or two degrees above the freezing-point, by stoves.
10136-8{_}15652{_}To keep     potatoes for a considerable time, the best way is to place them     in thin layers on a platform suspended in an ice-cellar: there,     the temperature being always below that of active vegetation,     they will not sprout; while, not being above one or two degrees     below the freezing-point, the tubers will not be frostbitten.
10136-8{_}15653{_}Another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop,     and keep the roots buried in earth; a third mode is to destroy     the vital principle, by kiln-drying, steaming, or scalding; a     fourth is to bury them so deep in dry soil, that no change of     temperature will reach them; and thus, being without air, they     will remain upwards of a year without vegetating.
10136-8{_}15654{_}POTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.
10136-8{_}15655{_}1144.
10136-8{_}15656{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt and water; to every 6 potatoes allow 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}15657{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15658{_}_Mode_.--Wash the potatoes clean, and boil them in salt and water by recipe No.
10136-8{_}15659{_}1138; when they are done, drain them, let them cool; then peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices: if these are too thin, they would break in the sauce.
10136-8{_}15660{_}Put the butter into a stewpan with the pepper, salt, gravy, and parsley; mix these ingredients well together, put in the potatoes, shake them two or three times, that they may be well covered with the sauce, and, when quite hot through, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve.
10136-8{_}15661{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes; 10 minutes for them to heat in the sauce.
10136-8{_}15662{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15663{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15664{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.

10136-8{_}15666{_}MASHED POTATOES.
10136-8{_}15667{_}1145.
10136-8{_}15668{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; to every lb.
10136-8{_}15669{_}of mashed potatoes allow 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15670{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk, salt to taste.
10136-8{_}15671{_}_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes in their skins; when done, drain them, and let them get thoroughly dry by the side of the fire; then peel them, and, as they are peeled, put them into a clean saucepan, and with a large fork beat them to a light paste; add butter, milk, and salt in the above proportion, and stir all the ingredients well over the fire.
10136-8{_}15672{_}When thoroughly hot, dish them lightly, and draw the fork backwards over the potatoes to make the surface rough, and serve.
10136-8{_}15673{_}When dressed in this manner, they may be browned at the top with a salamander, or before the fire.
10136-8{_}15674{_}Some cooks press the potatoes into moulds, then turn them out, and brown them in the oven: this is a pretty mode of serving, but it makes them heavy.
10136-8{_}15675{_}In whatever way they are sent to table, care must be taken to have them quite free from lumps.
10136-8{_}15676{_}_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes.
10136-8{_}15677{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15678{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15679{_}_Sufficient_,--1 lb.

10136-8{_}15687{_}_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes, well drain them, and pound them smoothly in a mortar, or beat them up with a fork; add the stock or broth, and rub the potatoes through a sieve.
10136-8{_}15688{_}Put the puree into a very clean saucepan with the butter; stir it well over the fire until thoroughly hot, and it will then be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}15689{_}A puree should be rather thinner than mashed potatoes, and is a delicious accompaniment to delicately broiled mutton cutlets.
10136-8{_}15690{_}Cream or milk may be substituted for the broth when the latter is not at hand.
10136-8{_}15691{_}A casserole of potatoes, which is often used for ragoûts instead of rice, is made by mashing potatoes rather thickly, placing them on a dish, and making an opening in the centre.
10136-8{_}15692{_}After having browned the potatoes in the oven, the dish should be wiped clean, and the ragout or fricassée poured in.
10136-8{_}15693{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to boil the potatoes; 6 or 7 minutes to warm the purée.
10136-8{_}15694{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15695{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15696{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}15697{_}of cooked potatoes for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}15698{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15699{_}[Illustration: SWEET POTATO.]
10136-8{_}15700{_}VARIETIES OF THE POTATO.--These are very numerous.
10136-8{_}15701{_}"They     differ," says an authority, "in their leaves and bulk of haulm;     in the colour of the skin of the tubers; in the colour of the     interior, compared with that of the skin; in the time of     ripening; in being farinaceous, glutinous, or watery; in tasting     agreeably or disagreeably; in cooking readily or tediously; in     the length of the subterraneous _stolones_ to which the tubers     are attached; in blossoming or not blossoming; and finally, in     the soil which they prefer."
10136-8{_}15702{_}The earliest varieties grown in     fields are,--the Early Kidney, the Nonsuch, the Early Shaw, and     the Early Champion.
10136-8{_}15703{_}This last is the most generally cultivated     round London: it is both mealy and hardy.
10136-8{_}15704{_}The sweet potato is     but rarely eaten in Britain; but in America it is often served     at table, and is there very highly esteemed.
10136-8{_}15705{_}POTATO RISSOLES.
10136-8{_}15706{_}1147.
10136-8{_}15707{_}INGREDIENTS.--Mashed potatoes, salt and pepper to taste; when liked, a very little minced parsley, egg, and bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}15708{_}[Illustration: POTATO RISSOLES.]
10136-8{_}15709{_}_Mode_.--Boil and mash the potatoes by recipe No.
10136-8{_}15710{_}1145; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and, when liked, a little minced parsley.
10136-8{_}15711{_}Roll the potatoes into small balls, cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard for about 10 minutes; let them drain before the fire, dish them on a napkin, and serve.
10136-8{_}15712{_}_Time_,--10 minutes to fry the rissoles.
10136-8{_}15713{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15714{_}_Note_.--The flavour of these rissoles may be very much increased by adding finely-minced tongue or ham, or even chopped onions, when these are liked.
10136-8{_}15715{_}QUALITIES OF POTATOES.--In making a choice from the many     varieties of potatoes which are everywhere found, the best way     is to get a sample and taste them, and then fix upon the kind     which best pleases your palate.
10136-8{_}15716{_}The Shaw is one of the most     esteemed of the early potatoes for field culture; and the Kidney     and Bread-fruit are also good sorts.
10136-8{_}15717{_}The Lancashire Pink is also     a good potato, and is much cultivated in the neighbourhood of     Liverpool.
10136-8{_}15718{_}As late or long-keeping potatoes, the Tartan or     Red-apple stands very high in favour.
10136-8{_}15719{_}POTATO SNOW.
10136-8{_}15720{_}1148.
10136-8{_}15721{_}INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt, and water.
10136-8{_}15722{_}_Mode_.--Choose large white potatoes, as free from spots as possible; boil them in their skins in salt and water until perfectly tender; drain and _dry them thoroughly_ by the side of the fire, and peel them.
10136-8{_}15723{_}Put a hot dish before the fire, rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve on to this dish; do not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and serve as hot as possible.
10136-8{_}15724{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes.
10136-8{_}15725{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}15726{_}per bushel.
10136-8{_}15727{_}_Sufficient_,--6 potatoes for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}15728{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}15729{_}THE POTATO AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD.--This valuable esculent,     next to wheat, is of the greatest importance in the eye of the     political economist.
10136-8{_}15730{_}From no other crop that can be cultivated     does the public derive so much benefit; and it has been     demonstrated that an acre of potatoes will feed double the     number of people that can be fed from an acre of wheat.
10136-8{_}15731{_}TO DRESS SALSIFY.
10136-8{_}15732{_}1149.
10136-8{_}15733{_}INGREDIENTS.--Salsify; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15734{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15735{_}_Mode_.--Scrape the roots gently, so as to strip them only of their outside peel; cut them into pieces about 4 inches long, and, as they are peeled, throw them into water with which has been mixed a little lemon-juice, to prevent their discolouring.
10136-8{_}15736{_}Put them into boiling water, with salt, butter, and lemon-juice in the above proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender; try them with a fork; and, when it penetrates easily, they are done.
10136-8{_}15737{_}Drain the salsify, and serve with a good white sauce or French melted butter.
10136-8{_}15738{_}_Time_.--30 to 50 minutes.
10136-8{_}15739{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}15740{_}_Note_.--This vegetable may be also boiled, sliced, and fried in batter of a nice brown.
10136-8{_}15741{_}When crisp and a good colour, they should be served with fried parsley in the centre of the dish, and a little fine salt sprinkled over the salsify.
10136-8{_}15742{_}SALSIFY.--This esculent is, for the sake of its roots,     cultivated in gardens.
10136-8{_}15743{_}It belongs to the Composite class of     flowers, which is the most extensive family in the vegetable     kingdom.
10136-8{_}15744{_}This family is not only one of the most natural and     most uniform in structure, but there is also a great similarity     existing in the properties of the plants of which it is     composed.
10136-8{_}15745{_}Generally speaking, all composite flowers are tonic or     stimulant in their medical virtues.
10136-8{_}15746{_}BOILED SEA-KALE.
10136-8{_}15747{_}1150.
10136-8{_}15748{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}15749{_}[Illustration: BOILED SEA-KALE.]
10136-8{_}15750{_}_Mode_.--Well wash the kale, cut away any wormeaten pieces, and tie it into small bunches; put it into _boiling_ water, salted in the above proportion, and let it boil quickly until tender.
10136-8{_}15751{_}Take it out, drain, untie the bunches, and serve with plain melted butter or white sauce, a little of which may be poured over the kale.
10136-8{_}15752{_}Sea-kale may also be parboiled and stewed in good brown gravy: it will then take about 1/2 hour altogether.
10136-8{_}15753{_}_Time_.--15 minutes; when liked very thoroughly done, allow an extra 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}15754{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 9d.
10136-8{_}15755{_}per basket.
10136-8{_}15756{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 12 heads for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}15757{_}_Seasonable_ from February to June.
10136-8{_}15758{_}[Illustration: SEA-KALE.]
10136-8{_}15759{_}SEA-KALE.--This plant belongs to the Asparagus tribe, and grows     on seashores, especially in the West of England, and in the     neighbourhood of Dublin.
10136-8{_}15760{_}Although it is now in very general use,     it did not come into repute till 1794.
10136-8{_}15761{_}It is easily cultivated,     and is esteemed as one of the most valuable esculents indigenous     to Britain.
10136-8{_}15762{_}As a vegetable, it is stimulating to the appetite,     easily digestible, and nutritious.
10136-8{_}15763{_}It is so light that the most     delicate organizations may readily eat it.
10136-8{_}15764{_}The flowers form a     favourite resort for bees, as their petals contain a great     amount of saccharine matter.
10136-8{_}15765{_}BOILED SALAD.
10136-8{_}15766{_}1151.
10136-8{_}15767{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 heads of celery, 1 pint of French beans, lettuce, and endive.
10136-8{_}15768{_}[Illustration: FRENCH BEANS.]
10136-8{_}15769{_}[Illustration: CHERVIL.]
10136-8{_}15770{_}_Mode_.--Boil the celery and beans separately until tender, and cut the celery into pieces about 2 inches long.
10136-8{_}15771{_}Put these into a salad-bowl or dish; pour over either of the sauces No.
10136-8{_}15772{_}506, 507, or 508, and garnish the dish with a little lettuce finely chopped, blanched endive, or a few tufts of boiled cauliflower.
10136-8{_}15773{_}This composition, if less agreeable than vegetables in their raw state, is more wholesome; for salads, however they may be compounded, when eaten uncooked, prove to some people indigestible.
10136-8{_}15774{_}Tarragon, chervil, burnet, and boiled onion, may be added to the above salad with advantage, as also slices of cold meat, poultry, or fish.
10136-8{_}15775{_}_Seasonable_ from July to October.
10136-8{_}15776{_}ACETARIOUS VEGETABLES.--By the term Acetarious vegetables, is     expressed a numerous class of plants, of various culture and     habit, which are principally used as salads, pickles, and     condiments.
10136-8{_}15777{_}They are to be considered rather as articles of     comparative luxury than as ordinary food, and are more desirable     for their coolness, or their agreeable flavour, than for their     nutritive powers.
10136-8{_}15778{_}CAULIFLOWER.--The cauliflower is less indigestible than the     cabbage; it possesses a most agreeable flavour, and is     sufficiently delicate to be served at the tables of the wealthy.
10136-8{_}15779{_}It is a wholesome vegetable, but should be eaten moderately, as     it induces flatulence.
10136-8{_}15780{_}Persons of weak constitutions and     delicate stomachs should abstain from cauliflower as much as     possible.
10136-8{_}15781{_}They may be prepared in a variety of ways; and, in     selecting them, the whitest should be chosen; those tinged with     green or yellow being of indifferent quality.
10136-8{_}15782{_}SUMMER SALAD.
10136-8{_}15783{_}1152.
10136-8{_}15784{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 lettuces, 2 handfuls of mustard-and-cress, 10 young radishes, a few slices of cucumber.
10136-8{_}15785{_}[Illustration: SALAD IN BOWL.]
10136-8{_}15786{_}_Mode_.--Let the herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad, and, if at all stale or dead-looking, let them lie in water for an hour or two, which will very much refresh them.
10136-8{_}15787{_}Wash and carefully pick them over, remove any decayed or wormeaten leaves, and drain them thoroughly by swinging them gently in a clean cloth.
10136-8{_}15788{_}With a silver knife, cut the lettuces into small pieces, and the radishes and cucumbers into thin slices; arrange all these ingredients lightly on a dish, with the mustard-and-cress, and pour under, but not over the salad, either of the sauces No.
10136-8{_}15789{_}506, 507, or 508, and do not stir it up until it is to be eaten.
10136-8{_}15790{_}It may be garnished with hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, sliced cucumbers, nasturtiums, cut vegetable-flowers, and many other things that taste will always suggest to make a pretty and elegant dish.
10136-8{_}15791{_}In making a good salad, care must be taken to have the herbs freshly gathered, and _thoroughly drained_ before the sauce is added to them, or it will be watery and thin.
10136-8{_}15792{_}Young spring onions, cut small, are by many persons considered an improvement to salads; but, before these are added, the cook should always consult the taste of her employer.
10136-8{_}15793{_}Slices of cold meat or poultry added to a salad make a convenient and quickly-made summer luncheon-dish; or cold fish, flaked, will also be found exceedingly nice, mixed with it.
10136-8{_}15794{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}15795{_}for a salad for 5 or 6 persons; but more expensive when the herbs are forced.
10136-8{_}15796{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15797{_}_Seasonable_ from May to September.
10136-8{_}15798{_}CUCUMBERS.--The cucumber is refreshing, but neither nutritious     nor digestible, and should be excluded from the regimen of the     delicate.
10136-8{_}15799{_}There are various modes of preparing cucumbers.
10136-8{_}15800{_}When     gathered young, they are called gherkins: these, pickled, are     much used in seasonings.
10136-8{_}15801{_}[Illustration: CUCUMBER-SLICE.]
10136-8{_}15802{_}RADISHES.--This is the common name given to the root of the     _Raphanus satious_, one of the varieties of the cultivated     horseradish.
10136-8{_}15803{_}There are red and white radishes; and the French     have also what they call violet and black ones, of which the     black are the larger.
10136-8{_}15804{_}Radishes are composed of nearly the same     constituents as turnips, that is to say, mostly fibre and     nitrogen; and, being generally eaten raw, it is on the last of     these that their flavour depends.
10136-8{_}15805{_}They do not agree with people,     except those who are in good health, and have active digestive     powers; for they are difficult of digestion, and cause     flatulency and wind, and are the cause of headaches when eaten     to excess.
10136-8{_}15806{_}Besides being eaten raw, they are sometimes, but     rarely, boiled; and they also serve as a pretty garnish for     salads.
10136-8{_}15807{_}In China, the radish may be found growing naturally,     without cultivation; and may be occasionally met with in England     as a weed, in similar places to where the wild turnip grows; it,     however, thrives best in the garden, and the ground it likes     best is a deep open loam, or a well-manured sandy soil.

10136-8{_}15810{_}WINTER SALAD.
10136-8{_}15811{_}1153.
10136-8{_}15812{_}INGREDIENTS.--Endive, mustard-and-cress, boiled beetroot, 3 or 4 hard-boiled eggs, celery.
10136-8{_}15813{_}_Mode_.--The above ingredients form the principal constituents of a winter salad, and may be converted into a very pretty dish, by nicely contrasting the various colours, and by tastefully garnishing it.
10136-8{_}15814{_}Shred the celery into thin pieces, after having carefully washed and cut away all wormeaten pieces; cleanse the endive and mustard-and-cress free from grit, and arrange these high in the centre of a salad-bowl or dish; garnish with the hard-boiled eggs and beetroot, both of which should be cut in slices; and pour into the dish, but not over the salad, either of the sauces No.
10136-8{_}15815{_}506, 507, or 508.
10136-8{_}15816{_}Never dress a salad long before it is required for table, as, by standing, it loses its freshness and pretty crisp and light appearance; the sauce, however, may always be prepared a few hours beforehand, and when required for use, the herbs laid lightly over it.
10136-8{_}15817{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}15818{_}for a salad for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15819{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15820{_}_Seasonable_ from the end of September to March.
10136-8{_}15821{_}SALADS.--Salads are raw vegetables, of which, among us, the     lettuce is the most generally used; several others, however,     such as cresses, celery, onions, beetroot, &c., are occasionally     employed.
10136-8{_}15822{_}As vegetables eaten in a raw state are apt to ferment     on the stomach, and as they have very little stimulative power     upon that organ, they are usually dressed with some condiments,     such as pepper, vinegar, salt, mustard, and oil.
10136-8{_}15823{_}Respecting the     use of these, medical men disagree, especially in reference to     oil, which is condemned by some and recommended by others.
10136-8{_}15824{_}POTATO SALAD.
10136-8{_}15825{_}1154.
10136-8{_}15826{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 cold boiled potatoes, 4 tablespoonfuls of tarragon or plain vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.
10136-8{_}15827{_}_Mode_.--Cut the potatoes into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; put these into a salad-bowl with oil and vinegar in the above proportion; season with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of minced parsley; stir the salad well, that all the ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated, and it is ready to serve.
10136-8{_}15828{_}This should be made two or three hours before it is wanted for table.
10136-8{_}15829{_}Anchovies, olives, or pickles may be added to this salad, as also slices of cold beef, fowl, or turkey.
10136-8{_}15830{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}15837{_}TO BOIL SPINACH (English Mode).
10136-8{_}15838{_}1155.
10136-8{_}15839{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of salt, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}15840{_}of butter, pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}15841{_}[Illustration: SPINACH GARNISHED WITH CROÛTONS.]
10136-8{_}15842{_}_Mode_.--Pick the spinach carefully, and see that no stalks or weeds are left amongst it; wash it in several waters, and, to prevent it being gritty, act in the following manner:--Have ready two large pans or tubs filled with water; put the spinach into one of these, and thoroughly wash it; then, _with the hands_, take out the spinach, and put it into the _other tub_ of water (by this means all the grit will be left at the bottom of the tub); wash it again, and, should it not be perfectly free from dirt, repeat the process.
10136-8{_}15843{_}Put it into a very large saucepan, with about 1/2 pint of water, just sufficient to keep the spinach from burning, and the above proportion of salt.
10136-8{_}15844{_}Press it down frequently with a wooden spoon, that it may be done equally; and when it has boiled for rather more than 10 minutes, or until it is perfectly tender, drain it in a colander, squeeze it quite dry, and chop it finely.
10136-8{_}15845{_}Put the spinach into a clean stewpan, with the butter and a seasoning of pepper; stir the whole over the fire until quite hot; then put it on a hot dish, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}15846{_}_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach, 5 minutes to warm with the butter.
10136-8{_}15847{_}_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.
10136-8{_}15848{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15849{_}_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from November to March.
10136-8{_}15850{_}_Note_.--Grated nutmeg, pounded mace, or lemon-juice may also be added to enrich the flavour; and poached eggs are also frequently served with spinach: they should be placed on the top of it, and it should be garnished with sippets of toasted bread.--See coloured plate U.
10136-8{_}15851{_}VARIETIES OF SPINACH.--These comprise the Strawberry spinach,     which, under that name, was wont to be grown in our     flower-gardens; the Good King Harry, the Garden Oracle, the     Prickly, and the Round, are the varieties commonly used.
10136-8{_}15852{_}The     Oracle is a hardy sort, much esteemed in France, and is a native     of Tartary, introduced in 1548.
10136-8{_}15853{_}The common spinach has its     leaves round, and is softer and more succulent than any of the     Brassica tribe.
10136-8{_}15854{_}SPINACH DRESSED WITH CREAM, a la Francaise.
10136-8{_}15855{_}1156.

10136-8{_}15857{_}of butter, 8 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 small teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a very little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}15858{_}_Mode_.--Boil and drain the spinach as in recipe No.
10136-8{_}15859{_}1155; chop it finely, and put it into a stewpan with the butter; stir over a gentle fire, and, when the butter has dried away, add the remaining ingredients, and simmer for about 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}15860{_}Previously to adding the cream, boil it first, in case it should curdle.
10136-8{_}15861{_}Serve on a hot dish, and garnish either with sippets of toasted bread or leaves of puff-paste.
10136-8{_}15862{_}_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach; 10 minutes to stew with the cream.
10136-8{_}15863{_}_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.
10136-8{_}15864{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15865{_}_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from November to March.
10136-8{_}15866{_}[Illustration: SPINACH.]
10136-8{_}15867{_}SPINACH.--This is a Persian plant.
10136-8{_}15868{_}It has been cultivated in our     gardens about two hundred years, and is the most wholesome of     vegetables.
10136-8{_}15869{_}It is not very nutritious, but is very easily     digested.
10136-8{_}15870{_}It is very light and laxative.
10136-8{_}15871{_}Wonderful properties     have been ascribed to spinach.
10136-8{_}15872{_}It is an excellent vegetable, and     very beneficial to health.
10136-8{_}15873{_}Plainly dressed, it is a resource for     the poor; prepared luxuriantly, it is a choice dish for the     rich.
10136-8{_}15874{_}SPINACH.--This vegetable belongs to a sub-order of the     _Salsolaceae_, or saltworts, and is classified under the head of     _Spirolobeae_, with leaves shaped like worms, and of a succulent     kind.
10136-8{_}15875{_}In its geographical distribution it is commonly found in     extratropical and temperate regions, where they grow as weeds in     waste places, and among rubbish, and in marshes by the seashore.
10136-8{_}15876{_}In the tropics the order is rarely found.
10136-8{_}15877{_}Many of them are used     as potherbs, and some of them are emetic and vermifuge in their     medicinal properties.
10136-8{_}15878{_}FRENCH MODE OF DRESSING SPINACH.
10136-8{_}15879{_}1157.
10136-8{_}15880{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}15881{_}of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 8 tablespoonfuls of good gravy; when liked, a very little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}15882{_}_Mode_.--Pick, wash, and boil the spinach, as in recipe No.
10136-8{_}15883{_}1155, and when quite tender, drain and squeeze it perfectly dry from the water that hangs about it.
10136-8{_}15884{_}Chop it very fine, put the butter into a stewpan, and lay the spinach over that; stir it over a gentle fire, and dredge in the flour.
10136-8{_}15885{_}Add the gravy, and let it boil _quickly_ for a few minutes, that it may not discolour.
10136-8{_}15886{_}When the flavour of nutmeg is liked, grate some to the spinach, and when thoroughly hot, and the gravy has dried away a little, serve.
10136-8{_}15887{_}Garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}15888{_}_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach; 10 minutes to simmer in the gravy.
10136-8{_}15889{_}_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.
10136-8{_}15890{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}15891{_}_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from October to February.
10136-8{_}15892{_}_Note_.--For an entremets or second-course dish, spinach, dressed by the above recipe may be pressed into a hot mould; it should then be turned out quickly, and served very hot.

10136-8{_}15897{_}of butter, bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}15898{_}_Mode_.--Take off the stalks from the tomatoes; cut them into thick slices, and put them into a deep baking-dish; add a plentiful seasoning of pepper and salt, and butter in the above proportion; cover the whole with bread crumbs; drop over these a little clarified butter; bake in a moderate oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}15899{_}This vegetable, dressed as above, is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to all kinds of roast meat.
10136-8{_}15900{_}The tomatoes, instead of being cut in slices, may be baked whole; but they will take rather longer time to cook.

10136-8{_}15907{_}TOMATOES.--The Tomato is a native of tropical countries, but is     now cultivated considerably both in France and England.
10136-8{_}15908{_}Its skin     is of a brilliant red, and its flavour, which is somewhat sour,     has become of immense importance in the culinary art.
10136-8{_}15909{_}It is used     both fresh and preserved.
10136-8{_}15910{_}When eaten fresh, it is served as an     _entremets_; but its principal use is in sauce and gravy; its     flavour stimulates the appetite, and is almost universally     approved.
10136-8{_}15911{_}The Tomato is a wholesome fruit, and digests easily.
10136-8{_}15912{_}From July to September, they gather the tomatoes green in     France, not breaking them away from the stalk; they are then     hung, head downwards, in a dry and not too cold place; and there     they ripen.

10136-8{_}15919{_}1159.
10136-8{_}15920{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}15921{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.
10136-8{_}15922{_}_Mode_.--Slice the tomatoes into a _lined_ saucepan; season them with pepper and salt, and place small pieces of butter on them.
10136-8{_}15923{_}Cover the lid down closely, and stew from 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are perfectly tender; add the vinegar, stir two or three times, and serve with any kind of roast meat, with which they will be found a delicious accompaniment.
10136-8{_}15924{_}_Time_.--20 to 25 minutes.

10136-8{_}15929{_}ANALYSIS OF THE TOMATO.--The fruit of the love-apple is the only     part used as an esculent, and it has been found to contain a     particular acid, a volatile oil, a brown, very fragrant     extracto-resinous matter, a vegeto-mineral matter,     muco-saccharine, some salts, and, in all probability, an     alkaloid.
10136-8{_}15930{_}The whole plant has a disagreeable odour, and its     juice, subjected to the action of the fire, emits a vapour so     powerful as to cause vertigo and vomiting.
10136-8{_}15931{_}II.
10136-8{_}15932{_}1160.
10136-8{_}15933{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, about 1/2 pint of good gravy, thickening of butter and flour, cayenne and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}15934{_}_Mode_.--Take out the stalks of the tomatoes; put them into a wide stewpan, pour over them the above proportion of good brown gravy, and stew gently until they are tender, occasionally _carefully_ turning them, that they may be equally done.
10136-8{_}15935{_}Thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour worked together on a plate; let it just boil up after the thickening is added, and serve.
10136-8{_}15936{_}If it be at hand, these should be served on a silver or plated vegetable-dish.
10136-8{_}15937{_}_Time_.--20 to 25 minutes, very gentle stewing.

10136-8{_}15942{_}THE TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--This vegetable is a native of Mexico     and South America, but is also found in the East Indies, where     it is supposed to have been introduced by the Spaniards.
10136-8{_}15943{_}In this     country it is much more cultivated than it formerly was; and the     more the community becomes acquainted with the many agreeable     forms in which the fruit can be prepared, the more widely will     its cultivation be extended.
10136-8{_}15944{_}For ketchup, soups, and sauces, it     is equally applicable, and the unripe fruit makes one of the     best pickles.

10136-8{_}15946{_}1161.
10136-8{_}15947{_}INGREDIENTS.--Truffles, buttered paper.
10136-8{_}15948{_}_Mode_.--Select some fine truffles; cleanse them, by washing them in several waters with a brush, until not a particle of sand or grit remains on them; wrap each truffle in buttered paper, and bake in a hot oven for quite an hour; take off the paper, wipe the truffles, and serve them in a hot napkin.
10136-8{_}15949{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}15950{_}_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.
10136-8{_}15951{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15952{_}[Illustration: TRUFFLES.]
10136-8{_}15953{_}THE COMMON TRUFFLE.--This is the _Tuber cibarium_ of science,     and belongs to that numerous class of esculent fungi     distinguished from other vegetables not only by the singularity     of their forms, but by their chemical composition.
10136-8{_}15954{_}Upon     analysis, they are found not only to contain the usual     components of the vegetable kingdom, such as carbon, oxygen, and     hydrogen, but likewise a large proportion of nitrogen; from     which they approach more nearly to the nature of animal flesh.
10136-8{_}15955{_}It was long ago observed by Dr. Darwin, that all the mushrooms     cooked at our tables, as well as those used for ketchup,     possessed an animal flavour; and soup enriched by mushrooms only     has sometimes been supposed to contain meat.
10136-8{_}15956{_}TO DRESS TRUFFLES WITH CHAMPAGNE.
10136-8{_}15957{_}1162.
10136-8{_}15958{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 fine black truffles, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 2 onions, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 glasses of champagne, 1/2 pint of stock.
10136-8{_}15959{_}_Mode_.--Carefully select the truffles, reject those that have a musty smell, and wash them well with a brush, in cold water only, until perfectly clean.
10136-8{_}15960{_}Put the bacon into a stewpan, with the truffles and the remaining ingredients; simmer these gently for an hour, and let the whole cool in the stewpan.
10136-8{_}15961{_}When to be served, rewarm them, and drain them on a clean cloth; then arrange them on a delicately white napkin, that it may contrast as strongly as possible with the truffles, and serve.
10136-8{_}15962{_}The trimmings of truffles are used to flavour gravies, stock, sauces, &c.; and are an excellent addition to ragouts, made dishes of fowl, &c.
10136-8{_}15963{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}15964{_}_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.
10136-8{_}15965{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15966{_}THE TRUFFLE.--The Truffle belongs to the family of the Mushroom.
10136-8{_}15967{_}It is certain that the truffle must possess, equally with other     plants, organs of reproduction; yet, notwithstanding all the     efforts of art and science, it has been impossible to subject it     to a regular culture.
10136-8{_}15968{_}Truffles grow at a considerable depth     under the earth, never appearing on the surface.
10136-8{_}15969{_}They are found     in many parts of France: those of Périgord Magny are the most     esteemed for their odour.
10136-8{_}15970{_}There are three varieties of the     species,--the black, the red, and the white: the latter are of     little value.
10136-8{_}15971{_}The red are very rare, and their use is     restricted.
10136-8{_}15972{_}The black has the highest repute, and its     consumption is enormous.
10136-8{_}15973{_}When the peasantry go to gather     truffles, they take a pig with them to scent out the spot where     they grow.
10136-8{_}15974{_}When that is found, the pig turns up the surface with     his snout, and the men then dig until they find the truffles.
10136-8{_}15975{_}Good truffles are easily distinguished by their agreeable     perfume; they should be light in proportion to their size, and     elastic when pressed by the finger.
10136-8{_}15976{_}To have them in perfection,     they should be quite fresh, as their aroma is considerably     diminished by any conserving process.
10136-8{_}15977{_}Truffles are stimulating     and beating.
10136-8{_}15978{_}Weak stomachs digest them with difficulty.
10136-8{_}15979{_}Some of     the culinary uses to which they are subjected render them more     digestible; but they should always be eaten sparingly.
10136-8{_}15980{_}Their     chief use is in seasoning and garnitures.
10136-8{_}15981{_}In short, a professor     has said, "Meats with truffles are the most distinguished dishes     that opulence can offer to the epicure."
10136-8{_}15982{_}The Truffle grows in     clusters, some inches below the surface of the soil, and is of     an irregular globular form.
10136-8{_}15983{_}Those which grow wild in England are     about the size of a hen's egg, and have no roots.
10136-8{_}15984{_}As there is     nothing to indicate the places where they are, dogs have been     trained to discriminate their scent, by which they are     discovered.
10136-8{_}15985{_}Hogs are very fond of them, and frequently lead to     their being found, from their rutting up the ground in search of     them.
10136-8{_}15986{_}ITALIAN MODE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES.
10136-8{_}15987{_}1163.
10136-8{_}15988{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1/4 pint of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little finely-minced garlic, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}15989{_}_Mode_.--After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin slices, and put them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, and mace in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}15990{_}Bake them for nearly an hour, and, just before serving, add the lemon-juice, and send them to table very hot.
10136-8{_}15991{_}_Time_.--Nearly 1 hour.
10136-8{_}15992{_}_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.
10136-8{_}15993{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}15994{_}WHERE TRUFFLES ARE FOUND.--In this country, the common truffle     is found on the downs of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Kent; and     they abound in dry light soils, and more especially in oak and     chestnut forests.
10136-8{_}15995{_}In France they are plentiful, and many are     imported from the south of that country and Italy, where they     are much larger and in greater perfection: they lose, however,     much of their flavour by drying.
10136-8{_}15996{_}Truffles have in England been     tried to be propagated artificially, but without success.
10136-8{_}15997{_}TRUFFLES A L'ITALIENNE.
10136-8{_}15998{_}1164.
10136-8{_}15999{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1 minced shalot, salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}16000{_}of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of good brown gravy, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne to taste.
10136-8{_}16001{_}_Mode_.--Wash the truffles and cut them into slices about the size of a penny-piece; put them into a sauté pan, with the parsley, shalot, salt, pepper, and 1 oz.
10136-8{_}16002{_}of butter; stir them over the fire, that they may all be equally done, which will be in about 10 minutes, and drain off some of the butter; then add a little more fresh butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and a little cayenne; stir over the fire until the whole is on the point of boiling, when serve.
10136-8{_}16003{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}16004{_}_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.
10136-8{_}16005{_}_Seasonable_ from November to March.
10136-8{_}16006{_}USES OF THE TRUFFLE.--Like the Morel, truffles are seldom eaten     alone, but are much used in gravies, soups, and ragoûts.
10136-8{_}16007{_}They     are likewise dried for the winter months, and, when reduced to     powder, form a useful culinary ingredient; they, however, have     many virtues attributed to them which they do not possess.
10136-8{_}16008{_}Their     wholesomeness is, perhaps, questionable, and they should be     eaten with moderation.
10136-8{_}16009{_}BOILED TURNIPS.
10136-8{_}16010{_}1165.
10136-8{_}16011{_}INGREDIENTS.--Turnips; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}16012{_}_Mode_.--Pare the turnips, and, should they be very large, divide them into quarters; but, unless this is the case, let them be cooked whole.
10136-8{_}16013{_}Put them into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender.
10136-8{_}16014{_}Try them with a fork, and, when done, take them up in a colander; let them thoroughly drain, and serve.
10136-8{_}16015{_}Boiled turnips are usually sent to table with boiled mutton, but are infinitely nicer when mashed than served whole: unless nice and young, they are scarcely worth the trouble of dressing plainly as above.
10136-8{_}16016{_}_Time_.--Old turnips, 3/4 to 1-1/4 hour; young ones, about 18 to 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}16017{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}16018{_}per bunch.
10136-8{_}16019{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a bunch of 12 turnips for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16020{_}_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year; but in spring only useful for flavouring gravies, &c.  [Illustration: TURNIPS.]
10136-8{_}16021{_}THE TURNIP.--This vegetable is the _Brassica Rapa_ of science,     and grows wild in England, but cannot be brought exactly to     resemble what it becomes in a cultivated state.
10136-8{_}16022{_}It is said to     have been originally introduced from Hanover, and forms an     excellent culinary vegetable, much used all over Europe, where     it is either eaten alone or mashed and cooked in soups and     stews.
10136-8{_}16023{_}They do not thrive in a hot climate; for in India they,     and many more of our garden vegetables, lose their flavour and     become comparatively tasteless.
10136-8{_}16024{_}The Swede is the largest     variety, but it is too coarse for the table.
10136-8{_}16025{_}MASHED TURNIPS.
10136-8{_}16026{_}1166.
10136-8{_}16027{_}INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 large turnips; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}16028{_}of butter, cayenne or white pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}16029{_}_Mode_.--Pare the turnips, quarter them, and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion; boil them until tender; then drain them in a colander, and squeeze them as dry as possible by pressing them with the back of a large plate.
10136-8{_}16030{_}When quite free from water, rub the turnips with a wooden spoon through the colander, and put them into a very clean saucepan; add the butter, white pepper, or cayenne, and, if necessary, a little salt.
10136-8{_}16031{_}Keep stirring them over the fire until the butter is well mixed with them, and the turnips are thoroughly hot; dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}16032{_}A little cream or milk added after the turnips are pressed through the colander, is an improvement to both the colour and flavour of this vegetable.
10136-8{_}16033{_}_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the turnips; 10 minutes to warm them through.
10136-8{_}16034{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}16035{_}per bunch.
10136-8{_}16036{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}16037{_}_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year; but in spring only good for flavouring gravies.
10136-8{_}16038{_}VEGETABLES REDUCED TO PURÉE.--Persons in the flower of youth,     having healthy stomachs, and leading active lives, may eat all     sorts of vegetables, without inconvenience, save, of course, in     excess.
10136-8{_}16039{_}The digestive functions possess great energy during the     period of youth: the body, to develop itself, needs nourishment.
10136-8{_}16040{_}Physical exercise gives an appetite, which it is necessary to     satisfy, and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the     gastric organs.
10136-8{_}16041{_}As old proverb says, "At twenty one can digest     iron."
10136-8{_}16042{_}But for aged persons, the sedentary, or the delicate, it     is quite otherwise.
10136-8{_}16043{_}Then the gastric power has considerably     diminished, the digestive organs have lost their energy, the     process of digestion is consequently slower, and the least     excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for     several days.
10136-8{_}16044{_}Those who generally digest vegetables with     difficulty, should eat them reduced to a pulp or purée, that is     to say, with their skins and tough fibres removed.
10136-8{_}16045{_}Subjected to     this process, vegetables which, when entire, would create     flatulence and wind, are then comparatively harmless.
10136-8{_}16046{_}Experience     has established the rule, that nourishment is not complete     without the alliance of meat with vegetables.
10136-8{_}16047{_}We would also add,     that the regime most favourable to health is found in variety:     variety pleases the senses, monotony is disagreeable.
10136-8{_}16048{_}The eye is     fatigued by looking always on one object, the ear by listening     to one sound, and the palate by tasting one flavour.
10136-8{_}16049{_}It is the     same with the stomach: consequently, variety of food is one of     the essentials for securing good digestion.
10136-8{_}16050{_}GERMAN MODE OF COOKING TURNIPS.
10136-8{_}16051{_}1167.
10136-8{_}16052{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 large turnips, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}16053{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste, rather more than 1/2 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 tablespoonful of flour.
10136-8{_}16054{_}_Mode_.--Make the butter hot in a stewpan, lay in the turnips, after having pared and cut them into dice, and season them with pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}16055{_}Toss them over the fire for a few minutes, then add the broth, and simmer the whole gently till the turnips are tender.
10136-8{_}16056{_}Brown the above proportion of flour with a little butter; add this to the turnips, let them simmer another 5 minutes, and serve.
10136-8{_}16057{_}Boiled mutton is usually sent to table with this vegetable, and may be cooked with the turnips by placing it in the midst of them: the meat would then be very delicious, as, there being so little liquid with the turnips, it would almost be steamed, and consequently very tender.
10136-8{_}16058{_}_Time_.--20 minutes.
10136-8{_}16059{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}16060{_}per bunch.
10136-8{_}16061{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}16062{_}_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year.
10136-8{_}16063{_}TURNIPS.--Good turnips are delicate in texture, firm, and sweet.
10136-8{_}16064{_}The best sorts contain a sweet juicy mucilage, uniting with the     aroma a slightly acid quality, which is completely neutralized     in cooking.
10136-8{_}16065{_}The turnip is prepared in a variety of ways.
10136-8{_}16066{_}Ducks     stuffed with turnips have been highly appreciated.
10136-8{_}16067{_}It is useful     in the regimen of persons afflicted with chronic visceral     irritations.
10136-8{_}16068{_}The turnip only creates flatulency when it is soft,     porous, and stringy.
10136-8{_}16069{_}It is then, consequently, bad.
10136-8{_}16070{_}TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE.
10136-8{_}16071{_}(An Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)
10136-8{_}16072{_}1168.
10136-8{_}16073{_}INGREDIENTS.--7 or 8 turnips, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}16074{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of white sauce, No.
10136-8{_}16075{_}538 or 539.
10136-8{_}16076{_}_Mode_.--Peel and cut the turnips in the shape of pears or marbles; boil them in salt and water, to which has been added a little butter, until tender; then take them out, drain, arrange them on a dish, and pour over the white sauce made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16077{_}538 or 539, and to which has been added a small lump of sugar.
10136-8{_}16078{_}In winter, when other vegetables are scarce, this will be found a very good and pretty-looking dish: when approved, a little mustard may be added to the sauce.
10136-8{_}16079{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to boil the turnips.
10136-8{_}16080{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}16081{_}per bunch.
10136-8{_}16082{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 side-dish.
10136-8{_}16083{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}16084{_}THE FRENCH NAVET.--This is a variety of the turnip; but, instead     of being globular, has more the shape of the carrot.
10136-8{_}16085{_}Its flavour     being excellent, it is much esteemed on the Continent for soups     and made dishes.
10136-8{_}16086{_}Two or three of them will impart as much     flavour as a dozen of the common turnips will.
10136-8{_}16087{_}Accordingly, when     stewed in gravy, they are greatly relished.
10136-8{_}16088{_}This flavour resides     in the rind, which is not cut off, but scraped.
10136-8{_}16089{_}This variety was     once grown in England, but now it is rarely found in our     gardens, though highly deserving of a place there.
10136-8{_}16090{_}It is of a     yellowish-white colour, and is sometimes imported to the London     market.
10136-8{_}16091{_}BOILED TURNIP GREENS.
10136-8{_}16092{_}1169.
10136-8{_}16093{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; turnip-greens.
10136-8{_}16094{_}_Mode_.--Wash the greens well in two or three waters, and pick off all the decayed and dead leaves; tie them in small bunches, and put them into plenty of boiling water, salted in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}16095{_}Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and when tender, pour them into a colander; let them drain, arrange them in a vegetable-dish, remove the string that the greens were tied with, and serve.
10136-8{_}16096{_}_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}16097{_}_Average cost_, 4d.
10136-8{_}16098{_}for a dish for 3 persons.
10136-8{_}16099{_}_Seasonable_ in March, April, and May.
10136-8{_}16100{_}CABBAGE, TURNIP-TOPS, AND GREENS.--All the cabbage tribe, which     comprises coleworts, brocoli, cauliflower, sprouts, and     turnip-tops, in order to be delicate, should be dressed young,     when they have a rapid growth; but, if they have stood the     summer, in order to be tender, they should be allowed to have a     touch of frost.
10136-8{_}16101{_}The cabbage contains much vegetable albumen, and     several parts sulphur and nitrate of potass.
10136-8{_}16102{_}Cabbage is heavy,     and a long time digesting, which has led to a belief that it is     very nourishing.
10136-8{_}16103{_}It is only fit food for robust and active     persons; the sedentary or delicate should carefully avoid it.
10136-8{_}16104{_}Cabbage may be prepared in a variety of ways: it serves as a     garniture to several recherché dishes,--partridge and cabbage     for example.
10136-8{_}16105{_}Bacon and cabbage is a very favourite dish; but     only a good stomach can digest it.
10136-8{_}16106{_}BOILED VEGETABLE MARROW.
10136-8{_}16107{_}1170.
10136-8{_}16108{_}INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; vegetable marrows.
10136-8{_}16109{_}[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW ON TOAST.]
10136-8{_}16110{_}_Mode_.--Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the marrows after peeling them, and boil them until quite tender.
10136-8{_}16111{_}Take them up with a slice, halve, and, should they be very large, quarter them.
10136-8{_}16112{_}Dish them on toast, and send to table with them a tureen of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt butter.
10136-8{_}16113{_}Large vegetable marrows may be preserved throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place; when wanted for use, a few slices should be cut and boiled in the same manner as above; but, when once begun, the marrow must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is cut.
10136-8{_}16114{_}Vegetable marrows are also very delicious mashed: they should be boiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon.
10136-8{_}16115{_}Heat them in a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and pepper, and a small piece of butter, and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish.
10136-8{_}16116{_}_Time_.--Young vegetable marrows 10 to 20 minutes; old ones, 1/2 to 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}16117{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.
10136-8{_}16118{_}per dozen.
10136-8{_}16119{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 moderate-sized marrow for each person.
10136-8{_}16120{_}_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be preserved all the winter.
10136-8{_}16121{_}FRIED VEGETABLE MARROW.
10136-8{_}16122{_}1171.
10136-8{_}16123{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 medium-sized vegetable marrows, egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.
10136-8{_}16124{_}_Mode_.--Peel, and boil the marrows until tender in salt and water; then drain them and cut them in quarters, and take out the seeds.
10136-8{_}16125{_}When thoroughly drained, brush the marrows over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs; have ready some hot lard, fry the marrow in this, and, when of a nice brown, dish; sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and serve.
10136-8{_}16126{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to boil the marrow, 7 minutes to fry it.
10136-8{_}16127{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.
10136-8{_}16128{_}per dozen.
10136-8{_}16129{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}16130{_}_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.
10136-8{_}16131{_}[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW.]
10136-8{_}16132{_}THE VEGETABLE MARROW.--This vegetable is now extensively used,     and belongs to the Cucurbits.
10136-8{_}16133{_}It is the _C.
10136-8{_}16134{_}ovifera_ of science,     and, like the melon, gourd, cucumber, and squash, is widely     diffused in the tropical or warmer regions of the globe.
10136-8{_}16135{_}Of the     nature of this family we have already spoken when treating of     the cucumber.
10136-8{_}16136{_}CUT VEGETABLES FOR SOUPS, &c.  [Illustration: VEGETABLE-CUTTER.]
10136-8{_}16137{_}1172.
10136-8{_}16138{_}The annexed engraving represents a cutter for shaping vegetables for soups, ragouts, stews, &c.; carrots and turnips being the usual vegetables for which this utensil is used.
10136-8{_}16139{_}Cut the vegetables into slices about 1/4 inch in thickness, stamp them out with the cutter, and boil them for a few minutes in salt and water, until tender.
10136-8{_}16140{_}Turnips should be cut in rather thicker slices than carrots, on account of the former boiling more quickly to a pulp than the latter.
10136-8{_}16141{_}CARROTS.--Several species of carrots are cultivated,--the red,     the yellow, and the which.
10136-8{_}16142{_}Those known as the Crecy carrots are     considered the best, and are very sweet.
10136-8{_}16143{_}The carrot has been     classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables, and as     difficult of digestion.
10136-8{_}16144{_}When the root becomes old, it is almost     as hard as wood; but the young carrot, which has not reached its     full growth, is tender, relishing, nutritious, and digests well     when properly cooked.
10136-8{_}16145{_}VEGETABLE MARROWS IN WHITE SAUCE.
10136-8{_}16146{_}1173.
10136-8{_}16147{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 moderate-sized marrows, 1/2 pint of white sauce, No.
10136-8{_}16148{_}539.
10136-8{_}16149{_}[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW IN WHITE SAUCE.]
10136-8{_}16150{_}_Mode_.--Pare the marrows; cut them in halves, and shape each half at the top in a point, leaving the bottom end flat for it to stand upright in the dish.
10136-8{_}16151{_}Boil the marrows in salt and water until tender; take them up very carefully, and arrange them on a hot dish.
10136-8{_}16152{_}Have ready 1/2 pint of white sauce, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16153{_}539; pour this over the marrows, and serve.
10136-8{_}16154{_}_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes to boil the marrows.
10136-8{_}16155{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.
10136-8{_}16156{_}per dozen.
10136-8{_}16157{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16158{_}_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.
10136-8{_}16159{_}BOILED INDIAN WHEAT or MAIZE.
10136-8{_}16160{_}1174.
10136-8{_}16161{_}INGREDIENTS.--The ears of young and green Indian wheat; to every 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}16162{_}_Mode_.--This vegetable, which makes one of the most delicious dishes brought to table, is unfortunately very rarely seen in Britain; and we wonder that, in the gardens of the wealthy, it is not invariably cultivated.
10136-8{_}16163{_}Our sun, it is true, possesses hardly power sufficient to ripen maize; but, with well-prepared ground, and in a favourable position, it might be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of autumn to serve as a vegetable.
10136-8{_}16164{_}The outside sheath being taken off and the waving fibres removed, let the ears be placed in boiling water, where they should remain for about 25 minutes (a longer time may be necessary for larger ears than ordinary); and, when sufficiently boiled and well drained, they may be sent to table whole, and with a piece of toast underneath them.
10136-8{_}16165{_}Melted butter should be served with them.
10136-8{_}16166{_}_Time_.--25 to 35 minutes.
10136-8{_}16167{_}_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.
10136-8{_}16168{_}_Sufficient_,--1 ear for each person.
10136-8{_}16169{_}_Seasonable_ in autumn.
10136-8{_}16170{_}_Note_.--William Cobbett, the English radical writer and politician, was a great cultivator and admirer of maize, and constantly ate it as a vegetable, boiled.
10136-8{_}16171{_}We believe he printed a special recipe for it, but we have been unable to lay our hands on it.
10136-8{_}16172{_}Mr. Buchanan, the present president of the United States, was in the habit, when ambassador here, of receiving a supply of Indian corn from America in hermetically-sealed cases; and the publisher of this work remembers, with considerable satisfaction, his introduction to a dish of this vegetable, when in America.
10136-8{_}16173{_}He found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea and the finest asparagus; but he felt at first slightly awkward in holding the large ear with one hand, whilst the other had to be employed in cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains.

10136-8{_}16175{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.
10136-8{_}16176{_}1175.
10136-8{_}16177{_}PUDDINGS AND PASTRY, familiar as they may be, and unimportant as they may be held in the estimation of some, are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultural resources in reference to the cereal grasses.
10136-8{_}16178{_}When they began to be made is uncertain; but we may safely presume, that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour.
10136-8{_}16179{_}Traditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the Deluge.
10136-8{_}16180{_}After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts of Asia, and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the Nile.
10136-8{_}16181{_}From this region, Greece, Carthage, and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, were colonized.
10136-8{_}16182{_}In process of time, Greece gave to the Romans the arts which she had thus received from Egypt, and these subsequently diffused them over Europe.
10136-8{_}16183{_}How these were carried to or developed in India and China, is not so well ascertained; and in America their ancient existence rests only on very indistinct traditions.
10136-8{_}16184{_}As to who was the real discoverer of the use of corn, we have no authentic knowledge.
10136-8{_}16185{_}The traditions of different countries ascribe it to various fabulous personages, whose names it is here unnecessary to introduce.
10136-8{_}16186{_}In Egypt, however, corn must have grown abundantly; for Abraham, and after him Jacob, had recourse to that country for supplies during times of famine.
10136-8{_}16187{_}1176.
10136-8{_}16188{_}THE HABITS OF A PEOPLE, to a great extent, are formed by the climate in which they live, and by the native or cultivated productions in which their country abounds.
10136-8{_}16189{_}Thus we find that the agricultural produce of the ancient Egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the present day, and the habits of the people are not materially altered.
10136-8{_}16190{_}In Greece, the products cultivated in antiquity were the same kinds of grains and legumes as are cultivated at present, with the vine, the fig, the olive, the apple, and other fruits.
10136-8{_}16191{_}So with the Romans, and so with other nations.
10136-8{_}16192{_}As to the different modes of artificially preparing those to please the taste, it is only necessary to say that they arise from the universal desire of novelty, characteristic of man in the development of his social conditions.
10136-8{_}16193{_}Thus has arisen the whole science of cookery, and thus arose the art of making puddings.
10136-8{_}16194{_}The porridge of the Scotch is nothing more than a species of hasty pudding, composed of oatmeal, salt, and water; and the "red pottage" for which Esau sold his birthright, must have been something similar.
10136-8{_}16195{_}The barley-gruel of the Lacedaemonians, of the Athenian gladiators and common people, was the same, with the exception of the slight seasoning it had beyond the simplicity of Scottish fare.
10136-8{_}16196{_}Here is the ancient recipe for the Athenian national dish:--"Dry near the fire, in the oven, twenty pounds of barley-flour; then parch it; add three pounds of linseed-meal, half a pound of coriander-seed, two ounces of salt, and the quantity of water necessary."
10136-8{_}16197{_}To this sometimes a little millet was added, in order to give the paste greater cohesion and delicacy.
10136-8{_}16198{_}1177.
10136-8{_}16199{_}OATMEAL AMONGST THE GREEKS AND ROMANS was highly esteemed, as was also rice, which they considered as beneficial to the chest.
10136-8{_}16200{_}They also held in high repute the Irion, or Indian wheat of the moderns.
10136-8{_}16201{_}The flour of this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding, and, parched or roasted, as eaten with a little salt.
10136-8{_}16202{_}The Spelt, or Red wheat, was likewise esteemed, and its flour formed the basis of the Carthaginian pudding, for which we here give the scientific recipe:--"Put a pound of red-wheat flour into water, and when it has steeped some time, transfer it to a wooden bowl.
10136-8{_}16203{_}Add three pounds of cream cheese, half a pound of honey, and one egg.
10136-8{_}16204{_}Beat the whole together, and cook it on a slow fire in a stewpan."
10136-8{_}16205{_}Should this be considered unpalatable, another form has been recommended.
10136-8{_}16206{_}"Sift the flour, and, with some water, put it into a wooden vessel, and, for ten days, renew the water twice each day.
10136-8{_}16207{_}At the end of that period, press out the water and place the paste in another vessel.
10136-8{_}16208{_}It is now to be reduced to the consistence of thick lees, and passed through a piece of new linen.
10136-8{_}16209{_}Repeat this last operation, then dry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk.
10136-8{_}16210{_}Season according to taste."
10136-8{_}16211{_}These are specimens of the puddings of antiquity, and this last recipe was held in especial favour by the Romans.
10136-8{_}16212{_}1178.
10136-8{_}16213{_}HOWEVER GREAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE QUALIFICATIONS of the ancients, however, in the art of pudding-making, we apprehend that such preparations as gave gratification to their palates, would have generally found little favour amongst the insulated inhabitants of Great Britain.
10136-8{_}16214{_}Here, from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated Christmas production, the grand feature of substantiality is primarily attended to.
10136-8{_}16215{_}Variety in the ingredients, we think, is held only of secondary consideration with the great body of the people, provided that the whole is agreeable and of sufficient abundance.
10136-8{_}16216{_}1179.
10136-8{_}16217{_}ALTHOUGH FROM PUDDINGS TO PASTRY is but a step, it requires a higher degree of art to make the one than to make the other.
10136-8{_}16218{_}Indeed, pastry is one of the most important branches of the culinary science.
10136-8{_}16219{_}It unceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight as well as to the taste; with erecting graceful monuments, miniature fortresses, and all kinds of architectural imitations, composed of the sweetest and most agreeable products of all climates and countries.
10136-8{_}16220{_}At a very early period, the Orientals were acquainted with the art of manipulating in pastry; but they by no means attained to the taste, variety, and splendour of design, by which it is characterized amongst the moderns.
10136-8{_}16221{_}At first it generally consisted of certain mixtures of flour, oil, and honey, to which it was confined for centuries, even among the southern nations of the European continent.
10136-8{_}16222{_}At the commencement of the middle ages, a change began to take place in the art of mixing it.
10136-8{_}16223{_}Eggs, butter, and salt came into repute in the making of paste, which was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat, seasoned with spices.
10136-8{_}16224{_}This advance attained, the next step was to inclose cream, fruit, and marmalades; and the next, to build pyramids and castles; when the summit of the art of the pastry-cook may be supposed to have been achieved.
10136-8{_}16225{_}DIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAKING OF PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.
10136-8{_}16226{_}1180.
10136-8{_}16227{_}A few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of which puddings and pastry are composed, may be acceptable as preliminary to the recipes in this department of Household Management.
10136-8{_}16228{_}1181.
10136-8{_}16229{_}_Flour_ should be of the best quality, and perfectly dry, and sifted before being used; if in the least damp, the paste made from it will certainly be heavy.
10136-8{_}16230{_}1182.
10136-8{_}16231{_}_Butter_, unless fresh is used, should be washed from the salt, and well squeezed and wrung in a cloth, to get out all the water and buttermilk, which, if left in, assists to make the paste heavy.
10136-8{_}16232{_}1183.
10136-8{_}16233{_}_Lard_ should be perfectly sweet, which may be ascertained by cutting the bladder through, and, if the knife smells sweet, the lard is good.
10136-8{_}16234{_}1184.
10136-8{_}16235{_}_Suet_ should be finely chopped, perfectly free from skin, and quite sweet; during the process of chopping, it should be lightly dredged with flour, which prevents the pieces from sticking together.
10136-8{_}16236{_}Beef suet is considered the best; but veal suet, or the outside fat of a loin or neck of mutton, makes good crusts; as also the skimmings in which a joint of mutton has been boiled, but _without_ vegetables.
10136-8{_}16237{_}1185.
10136-8{_}16238{_}_Clarified Beef Dripping_, directions for which will be found in recipes Nos.
10136-8{_}16239{_}621 and 622, answers very well for kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or for family use.
10136-8{_}16240{_}A very good short crust may be made by mixing with it a small quantity of moist sugar; but care must be taken to use the dripping sparingly, or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted to the paste.
10136-8{_}16241{_}1186.
10136-8{_}16242{_}Strict cleanliness must be observed in pastry-making; all the utensils used should be perfectly free from dust and dirt, and the things required for pastry, kept entirely for that purpose.
10136-8{_}16243{_}[Illustration: PASTE-BOARD AND ROLLING-PIN.]
10136-8{_}16244{_}1187.
10136-8{_}16245{_}In mixing paste, add the water very gradually, work the whole together with the knife-blade, and knead it until perfectly smooth.
10136-8{_}16246{_}Those who are inexperienced in pastry-making, should work the butter in by breaking it in small pieces and covering the paste rolled out.
10136-8{_}16247{_}It should then be dredged with flour, and the ends folded over and rolled out very thin again: this process must be repeated until all the butter is used.

10136-8{_}16250{_}The art of making paste requires much practice, dexterity, and skill: it should be touched as lightly as possible, made with cool hands and in a cool place (a marble slab is better than a board for the purpose), and the coolest part of the house should be selected for the process during warm weather.
10136-8{_}16251{_}1189.
10136-8{_}16252{_}To insure rich paste being light, great expedition must be used in the making and baking; for if it stand long before it is put in the oven, it becomes flat and heavy.

10136-8{_}16256{_}_Puff-paste_ requires a brisk oven, but not too hot, or it would blacken the crust; on the other hand, if the oven be too slack, the paste will be soddened, and will not rise, nor will it have any colour.
10136-8{_}16257{_}Tart-tins, cake-moulds, dishes for baked puddings, pattypans, &c., should all be buttered before the article intended to be baked is put in them: things to be baked on sheets should be placed on buttered paper.
10136-8{_}16258{_}Raised-pie paste should have a soaking heat, and paste glazed must have rather a slack oven, that the icing be not scorched.
10136-8{_}16259{_}It is better to ice tarts, &c. when they are three-parts baked.

10136-8{_}16264{_}1191.
10136-8{_}16265{_}To ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for puff-paste, put a small piece of the paste in previous to baking the whole, and then the heat can thus be judged of.
10136-8{_}16266{_}1192.
10136-8{_}16267{_}The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance, as one bad article will taint the whole mixture.
10136-8{_}16268{_}1193.
10136-8{_}16269{_}When the _freshness_ of eggs is _doubtful_, break each one separately in a cup, before mixing them altogether.
10136-8{_}16270{_}Should there be a bad one amongst them, it can be thrown away; whereas, if mixed with the good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled.
10136-8{_}16271{_}The yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles they are put into much lighter.
10136-8{_}16272{_}1194.
10136-8{_}16273{_}Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked, and, in many cases, stoned.
10136-8{_}16274{_}Currants should be well washed, pressed in a cloth, and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry; they should then be picked carefully over, and _every piece of grit or stone_ removed from amongst them.
10136-8{_}16275{_}To plump them, some cooks pour boiling water over them, and then dry them before the fire.
10136-8{_}16276{_}1195.
10136-8{_}16277{_}Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps.
10136-8{_}16278{_}To insure this, first mix the flour with a very small proportion of milk, and add the remainder by degrees.
10136-8{_}16279{_}Should the pudding be very lumpy, it may be strained through a hair sieve.
10136-8{_}16280{_}1196.
10136-8{_}16281{_}_All boiled puddings_ should be put on in _boiling water_, which must not be allowed to stop simmering, and the pudding must always be covered with the water; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept filled up.
10136-8{_}16282{_}[Illustration: BOILED-PUDDING MOULD.]
10136-8{_}16283{_}1197.
10136-8{_}16284{_}To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, place a small plate or saucer underneath it, and set the pan _on a trivet_ over the fire.
10136-8{_}16285{_}If a mould is used, this precaution is not necessary; but care must be taken to keep the pudding well covered with water.
10136-8{_}16286{_}1198.
10136-8{_}16287{_}For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes out of the pot, dip it into a basin of cold water, and the cloth will then not adhere to it.
10136-8{_}16288{_}Great expedition is necessary in sending puddings to table, as, by standing, they quickly become heavy, batter puddings particularly.
10136-8{_}16289{_}[Illustration: BOILED-PUDDING MOULD.]
10136-8{_}16290{_}1199.
10136-8{_}16291{_}For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups, or basins, should be always buttered before the mixture is put in them, and they should be put into the saucepan directly they are filled.
10136-8{_}16292{_}1200.
10136-8{_}16293{_}Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of pudding-cloths, as, from neglect in this particular, the outsides of boiled puddings frequently taste very disagreeably.
10136-8{_}16294{_}As soon as possible after it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in water, and then well washed, without soap, unless it be very greasy.
10136-8{_}16295{_}It should be dried out of doors, then folded up and kept in a dry place.
10136-8{_}16296{_}When wanted for use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge it slightly with flour.
10136-8{_}16297{_}[Illustration: PUDDING-BASIN.]
10136-8{_}16298{_}1201.
10136-8{_}16299{_}The _dry ingredients_ for puddings are better for being mixed some time before they are wanted; the liquid portion should only be added just before the pudding is put into the saucepan.
10136-8{_}16300{_}1202.
10136-8{_}16301{_}A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings; but this ingredient should be added very sparingly, as the flavour should not be detected.
10136-8{_}16302{_}1203.
10136-8{_}16303{_}When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them out of the dish they were baked in, bottom uppermost, and strew over them fine sifted sugar.
10136-8{_}16304{_}1204.
10136-8{_}16305{_}When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet the outside is sufficiently brown, cover them over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly cooked: this prevents them from getting burnt.

10136-8{_}16308{_}VERY GOOD PUFF-PASTE.
10136-8{_}16309{_}1205.
10136-8{_}16310{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}16311{_}of flour allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}16312{_}of butter, and not quite 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}16313{_}_Mode_.--Carefully weigh the flour and butter, and have the exact proportion; squeeze the butter well, to extract the water from it, and afterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture may remain.
10136-8{_}16314{_}Sift the flour; see that it is perfectly dry, and proceed in the following manner to make the paste, using a very _clean_ paste-board and rolling-pin:--Supposing the quantity to be 1 lb.
10136-8{_}16315{_}of flour, work the whole into a smooth paste, with not quite 1/2 pint of water, using a knife to mix it with: the proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion of the cook; if too much be added, the paste, when baked, will be tough.
10136-8{_}16316{_}Roll it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch; break 4 oz.
10136-8{_}16317{_}of the butter into small pieces; place these on the paste, sift over it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again, and put another 4 oz.
10136-8{_}16318{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}16319{_}Repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been rolled out 4 times, or equal quantities of flour and butter have been used.
10136-8{_}16320{_}Do not omit, every time the paste is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over that and the rolling-pin, to prevent both from sticking.
10136-8{_}16321{_}Handle the paste as lightly as possible, and do not press heavily upon it with the rolling-pin.
10136-8{_}16322{_}The next thing to be considered is the oven, as the baking of pastry requires particular attention.
10136-8{_}16323{_}Do not put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the paste; for the best-prepared paste, if not properly baked, will be good for nothing.
10136-8{_}16324{_}Brushing the paste as often as rolled out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the white of an egg, assists it to rise in _leaves_ or _flakes_.
10136-8{_}16325{_}As this is the great beauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try this method.

10136-8{_}16329{_}BUTTER.--About the second century of the Christian era, butter     was placed by Galen amongst the useful medical agents; and about     a century before him, Dioscorides mentioned that he had noticed     that fresh butter, made of ewes' and goats' milk, was served at     meals instead of oil, and that it took the place of fat in     making pastry.
10136-8{_}16330{_}Thus we have undoubted authority that, eighteen     hundred years ago, there existed a knowledge of the useful     qualities of butter.
10136-8{_}16331{_}The Romans seem to have set about making it     much as we do; for Pliny tells us, "Butter is made from milk;     and the use of this element, so much sought after by barbarous     nations, distinguished the rich from the common people.
10136-8{_}16332{_}It is     obtained principally from cows' milk; that from ewes is the     fattest; goats also supply some.
10136-8{_}16333{_}It is produced by agitating the     milk in long vessels with narrow openings: a little water is     added."

10136-8{_}16338{_}of butter, 4 oz.
10136-8{_}16339{_}of lard, not quite 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}16340{_}_Mode_.--This paste may be made by the directions in the preceding recipe, only using less butter and substituting lard for a portion of it.
10136-8{_}16341{_}Mix the flour to a smooth paste with not quite 1/2 pint of water; then roll it out 3 times, the first time covering the paste with butter, the second with lard, and the third with butter.
10136-8{_}16342{_}Keep the rolling-pin and paste slightly dredged with flour, to prevent them from sticking, and it will be ready for use.

10136-8{_}16345{_}BUTTER IN HASTE.--In his "History of Food," Soyer says that to     obtain butter instantly, it is only necessary, in summer, to put     new milk into a bottle, some hours after it has been taken from     the cow, and shake it briskly.
10136-8{_}16346{_}The clots which are thus formed     should be thrown into a sieve, washed and pressed together, and     they constitute the finest and most delicate butter that can     possibly be made.

10136-8{_}16353{_}This paste may be converted into an excellent short crust for sweet tart, by adding to the flour, after the butter is rubbed in, 2 tablespoonfuls of fine-sifted sugar.

10136-8{_}16355{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}16356{_}TO KEEP BUTTER FRESH.--One of the best means to preserve butter     fresh is, first to completely press out all the buttermilk, then     to keep it under water, renewing the water frequently, and to     remove it from the influence of heat and air, by wrapping it in     a wet cloth.
10136-8{_}16357{_}FRENCH PUFF-PASTE, or FEUILLETAGE.
10136-8{_}16358{_}(Founded on M. Ude's Recipe.)
10136-8{_}16359{_}1208.
10136-8{_}16360{_}INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of flour and butter--say 1 lb.
10136-8{_}16361{_}of each; 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, the yolks of 2 eggs, rather more than 1/4 pint of water.
10136-8{_}16362{_}_Mode_.--Weigh the flour; ascertain that it is perfectly _dry_, and sift it; squeeze all the water from the butter, and wring it in a clean cloth till there is no moisture remaining.
10136-8{_}16363{_}Put the flour on the paste-board, work lightly into it 2 oz.
10136-8{_}16364{_}of the butter, and then make a hole in the centre; into this well put the yolks of 2 eggs, the salt, and about 1/4 pint of water (the quantity of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the cook, as it is impossible to give the exact proportion of it); knead up the paste quickly and lightly, and, when quite smooth, roll it out square to the thickness of about 1/2 inch.
10136-8{_}16365{_}Presuming that the butter is perfectly free from moisture, and _as cool_ as possible, roll it into a ball, and place this ball of butter on the paste; fold the paste over the butter all round, and secure it by wrapping it well all over.
10136-8{_}16366{_}Flatten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rolling-pin until it is quite thin, but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through, and keep the board and paste dredged lightly with flour during the process of making it.
10136-8{_}16367{_}This rolling gives it the _first_ turn.
10136-8{_}16368{_}Now fold the paste in three, and roll out again, and, should the weather be very warm, put it in a cold place on the ground to cool between the several turns; for, unless this is particularly attended to, the paste will be spoiled.
10136-8{_}16369{_}Roll out the paste again _twice_, put it by to cool, then roll it out _twice_ more, which will make 6 _turnings_ in all.
10136-8{_}16370{_}Now fold the paste in two, and it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}16371{_}If properly baked and well made, this crust will be delicious, and should rise in the oven about 5 or 6 inches.
10136-8{_}16372{_}The paste should be made rather firm in the first instance, as the ball of butter is liable to break through.
10136-8{_}16373{_}Great attention must also be paid to keeping the butter very cool, as, if this is in a liquid and soft state, the paste will not answer at all.
10136-8{_}16374{_}Should the cook be dexterous enough to succeed in making this, the paste will have a much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter into 4 parts, and placing it over the rolled-out paste; but, until experience has been acquired, we recommend puff-paste made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16375{_}1205.
10136-8{_}16376{_}The above paste is used for vols-au-vent, small articles of pastry, and, in fact, everything that requires very light crust.

10136-8{_}16380{_}WHAT TO DO WITH RANCID BUTTER.--When butter has become very     rancid, it should be melted several times by a moderate heat,     with or without the addition of water, and as soon as it has     been well kneaded, after the cooling, in order to extract any     water it may have retained, it should be put into brown     freestone pots, sheltered from the contact of the air.
10136-8{_}16381{_}The     French often add to it, after it has been melted, a piece of     toasted bread, which helps to destroy the tendency of the batter     to rancidity.

10136-8{_}16388{_}Flour a baking-sheet, put the paste on this, and let it remain on ice or in some cool place for 1/2 hour; then roll twice more, turning it as before; place it again upon the ice for 1/4 hour, give it 2 more rolls, making 7 in all, and it is ready for use when required.

10136-8{_}16412{_}SUGAR AND BEETROOT.--There are two sorts of Beet,--white and     red; occasionally, in the south, a yellow variety is met with.
10136-8{_}16413{_}Beetroot contains twenty parts sugar.
10136-8{_}16414{_}Everybody knows that the     beet has competed with the sugar-cane, and a great part of the     French sugar is manufactured from beet.
10136-8{_}16415{_}Beetroot has a     refreshing, composing, and slightly purgative quality.
10136-8{_}16416{_}The young     leaves, when cooked, are a substitute for spinach; they are also     useful for mixing with sorrel, to lessen its acidity.
10136-8{_}16417{_}The large     ribs of the leaves are serviceable in various culinary     preparations; the root also may be prepared in several ways, but     its most general use is in salad.
10136-8{_}16418{_}Some writers upon the subject     have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easily digested,     but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its     qualities make quite a contrary statement.
10136-8{_}16419{_}Youth, of course, can     digest it; but to persons of a certain age beet is very     indigestible, or rather, it does not digest at all.
10136-8{_}16420{_}It is not     the sugary pulp which is indigestible, but its fibrous network     that resists the action of the gastric organs.
10136-8{_}16421{_}Thus, when the     root is reduced to a puree, almost any person may eat it.
10136-8{_}16422{_}FRENCH SUGAR.--It had long been thought that tropical heat was     not necessary to form sugar, and, about 1740, it was discovered     that many plants of the temperate zone, and amongst others the     beet, contained it.
10136-8{_}16423{_}Towards the beginning of the 19th century,     circumstances having, in France, made sugar scarce, and     consequently dear, the government caused inquiries to be     instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it.
10136-8{_}16424{_}Accordingly, it was ascertained that sugar exists in the whole     vegetable kingdom; that it is to be found in the grape,     chestnut, potato; but that, far above all, the beet contains it     in a large proportion.
10136-8{_}16425{_}Thus the beet became an object of the     most careful culture; and many experiments went to prove that in     this respect the old world was independent of the new.
10136-8{_}16426{_}Many     manufactories came into existence in all parts of France, and     the making of sugar became naturalized in that country.

10136-8{_}16442{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}16443{_}_Mode_.--With a knife, work the flour to a smooth paste with 1/2 pint of water; roll the crust out rather thin; place the butter over it in small pieces; dredge lightly over it some flour, and fold the paste over; repeat the rolling once more, and the crust will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}16444{_}It may be enriched by adding another 2 oz.

10136-8{_}16459{_}per pound.
10136-8{_}16460{_}WATER:--WHAT THE ANCIENTS THOUGHT OF IT.--All the nations of     antiquity possessed great veneration for water: thus, the     Egyptians offered prayers and homage to water, and the Nile was     an especial object of their adoration; the Persians would not     wash their hands; the Scythians honoured the Danube; the Greeks     and Romans erected altars to the fountains and rivers; and some     of the architectural embellishments executed for fountains in     Greece were remarkable for their beauty and delicacy.
10136-8{_}16461{_}The purity     of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients; and     we learn that the Athenians appointed four officers to keep     watch and ward over the water in their city.
10136-8{_}16462{_}These men had to     keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs, so that     the water might be preserved pure and limpid.
10136-8{_}16463{_}Like officers were     appointed in other Greek cities.
10136-8{_}16464{_}SUET CRUST, for Pies or Puddings.
10136-8{_}16465{_}1215.
10136-8{_}16466{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}16467{_}of flour allow 5 or 6 oz.
10136-8{_}16468{_}of beef suet, 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}16469{_}_Mode_.--Free the suet from skin and shreds; chop it extremely fine, and rub it well into the flour; work the whole to a smooth paste with the above proportion of water; roll it out, and it is ready for use.
10136-8{_}16470{_}This crust is quite rich enough for ordinary purposes, but when a better one is desired, use from 1/2 to 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}16471{_}of suet to every lb.
10136-8{_}16472{_}of flour.
10136-8{_}16473{_}Some cooks, for rich crusts, pound the suet in a mortar, with a small quantity of butter.
10136-8{_}16474{_}It should then be laid on the paste in small pieces, the same as for puff-crust, and will be found exceedingly nice for hot tarts.
10136-8{_}16475{_}5 oz.
10136-8{_}16476{_}of suet to every lb.
10136-8{_}16477{_}of flour will make a very good crust; and even 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}16478{_}will answer very well for children, or where the crust is wanted very plain.
10136-8{_}16479{_}_Average cost_, 5d.

10136-8{_}16485{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}16486{_}_Mode_.--Spread the flour, which should be sifted and thoroughly dry, on the paste-board; make a hole in the centre, into which put the butter; work it lightly into the flour, and when quite fine, add the salt; work the whole into a smooth paste with the eggs (yolks and whites) and water, and make it very firm.
10136-8{_}16487{_}Knead the paste well, and let it be rather stiff, that the sides of the pie may be easily raised, and that they do not afterwards tumble or shrink.
10136-8{_}16488{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}16489{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}16490{_}_Note_.--This paste may be very much enriched by making it with equal quantities of flour and butter; but then it is not so easily raised as when made plainer.
10136-8{_}16491{_}WATER SUPPLY IN ROME.--Nothing in Italy is more extraordinary     than the remains of the ancient aqueducts.
10136-8{_}16492{_}At first, the Romans     were contented with the water from the Tiber.
10136-8{_}16493{_}Ancus Martius was     the first to commence the building of aqueducts destined to     convey the water of the fountain of Piconia from Tibur to Rome,     a distance of some 33,000 paces.
10136-8{_}16494{_}Appius Claudius continued the     good work, and to him is due the completion of the celebrated     Appian Way.
10136-8{_}16495{_}In time, the gigantic waterways greatly multiplied,     and, by the reign of Nero, there were constructed nine principal     aqueducts, the pipes of which were of bricks, baked tiles,     stone, lead, or wood.
10136-8{_}16496{_}According to the calculation of Vigenerus,     half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every     day, by upwards of 10,000 small pipes not one-third of an inch     in diameter.
10136-8{_}16497{_}The water was received in large closed basins,     above which rose splendid monuments: these basins supplied other     subterranean conduits, connected with various quarters of the     city, and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished     with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets.
10136-8{_}16498{_}The water     which was not drinkable ran out, by means of large pipes, into     extensive inclosures, where it served to water cattle.
10136-8{_}16499{_}At these     places the people wished their linen; and here, too, was a     supply of the necessary element in case of fire.
10136-8{_}16500{_}COMMON CRUST FOR RAISED PIES.
10136-8{_}16501{_}1217.
10136-8{_}16502{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}16503{_}of flour allow 1/2 pint of water, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}16504{_}of butter, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}16505{_}of lard, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}16506{_}_Mode_.--Put into a saucepan the water; when it boils, add the butter and lard; and when these are melted, make a hole in the middle of the flour; pour in the water gradually; beat it well with a wooden spoon, and be particular in not making the paste too soft.
10136-8{_}16507{_}When it is well mixed, knead it with the hands until quite stiff, dredging a little flour over the paste and board, to prevent them from sticking.
10136-8{_}16508{_}When it is well kneaded, place it before the fire, with a cloth covered over it, for a few minutes; it will then be more easily worked into shape.
10136-8{_}16509{_}This paste does not taste so nicely as the preceding one, but is worked with greater facility, and answers just as well for raised pies, for the crust is seldom eaten.
10136-8{_}16510{_}_Average cost_, 5d, per lb.
10136-8{_}16511{_}LARD OR FLEAD CRUST.
10136-8{_}16512{_}1218.
10136-8{_}16513{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}16514{_}of flour allow 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16515{_}of lard or flead, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}16516{_}_Mode_.--Clear the flead free from skin, and slice it into thin flakes; rub it into the flour, add the salt, and work the whole into a smooth paste, with the above proportion of water; fold the paste over two or three times, beat it well with the rolling-pin, roll it out, and it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}16517{_}The crust made from this will be found extremely light, and may be made into cakes or tarts; it may also be very much enriched by adding more flead to the same proportion of flour.
10136-8{_}16518{_}_Average cost_, 8d.
10136-8{_}16519{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}16520{_}NUTRITIOUS QUALITIES OF FLOUR.--The gluten of grain and the     albumen of vegetable juices are identical in composition with     the albumen of blood.
10136-8{_}16521{_}Vegetable caseine has also the composition     of animal caseine.
10136-8{_}16522{_}The finest wheat flour contains more starch     than the coarser; the bran of wheat is proportionably richer in     gluten.
10136-8{_}16523{_}Rye and rye-bread contain a substance resembling     starch-gum (or dextrine, as it is called) in its properties,     which is very easily converted into sugar.
10136-8{_}16524{_}The starch of barley     approaches in many properties to cellulose, and is, therefore,     less digestible.
10136-8{_}16525{_}Oats are particularly rich in plastic     substances; Scotch oats are richer than those grown in England     or in Germany.
10136-8{_}16526{_}This kind of grain contains in its ashes, after     deduction of the silica of the husks, very nearly the same     ingredients as are found in the ashes of the juice of flesh.
10136-8{_}16527{_}Fine American flour is one of the varieties which is richest in     gluten, and is consequently one of the most nutritious.
10136-8{_}16528{_}ALMOND CHEESECAKES.
10136-8{_}16529{_}1219.
10136-8{_}16530{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.

10136-8{_}16540{_}[Illustration: ALMOND AND BLOSSOM.]
10136-8{_}16541{_}ALMONDS.--Almonds are the fruit of the _Amygdalus commenis_, and     are cultivated throughout the whole of the south of Europe,     Syria, Persia, and Northern Africa; but England is mostly     supplied with those which are grown in Spain and the south of     France.
10136-8{_}16542{_}They are distinguished into Sweet and Bitter, the     produce of different varieties.
10136-8{_}16543{_}Of the sweet, there are two     varieties, distinguished in commerce by the names of Jordan and     Valentia almonds.
10136-8{_}16544{_}The former are imported from Malaga, and are     longer, narrower, more pointed, and more highly esteemed than     the latter, which are imported from Valentia.
10136-8{_}16545{_}Bitter almonds are     principally obtained from Morocco, and are exported from     Mogador.
10136-8{_}16546{_}ALMOND PASTE, for Second-Course Dishes.
10136-8{_}16547{_}1220.
10136-8{_}16548{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.

10136-8{_}16550{_}of very finely sifted sugar, the whites of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}16551{_}_Mode_.--Blanch the almonds, and dry them thoroughly; put them into a mortar, and pound them well, wetting them gradually with the whites of 2 eggs.
10136-8{_}16552{_}When well pounded, put them into a small preserving-pan, add the sugar, and place the pan on a small but clear fire (a hot-plate is better); keep stirring until the paste is dry, then take it out of the pan, put it between two dishes, and, when cold, make it into any shape that fancy may dictate.
10136-8{_}16553{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16554{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}16555{_}for the above quantity.
10136-8{_}16556{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 small dishes of pastry.
10136-8{_}16557{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}16558{_}BITTER ALMONDS.--The Bitter Almond is a variety of the common     almond, and is injurious to animal life, on account of the great     quantity of hydrocyanic acid it contains, and is consequently     seldom used in domestic economy, unless it be to give flavour to     confectionery; and even then it should he used with great     caution.
10136-8{_}16559{_}A single drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds is     sufficient to destroy a bird, and four drops have caused the     death of a middle-sized dog.
10136-8{_}16560{_}BAKED ALMOND PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16561{_}(_Very rich_.)
10136-8{_}16562{_}1221.
10136-8{_}16563{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}16564{_}of almonds, 4 bitter ditto, 1 glass of sherry, 4 eggs, the rind and juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}16565{_}of butter, 1 pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
10136-8{_}16566{_}_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a smooth paste with the water; mix these with the butter, which should be melted; beat up the eggs, grate the lemon-rind, and strain the juice; add these, with the cream, sugar, and wine, to the other ingredients, and stir them well together.
10136-8{_}16567{_}When well mixed, put it into a pie-dish lined with puff-paste, and bake for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16568{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16569{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}16570{_}3d.
10136-8{_}16571{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}16572{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}16573{_}_Note_.--To make this pudding more economically, substitute milk for the cream; but then add rather more than 1 oz.
10136-8{_}16574{_}of finely grated bread.
10136-8{_}16575{_}USES OF THE SWEET ALMOND.--The kernels of the sweet almond are     used either in a green or ripe state, and as an article in the     dessert.
10136-8{_}16576{_}Into cookery, confectionery, perfumery, and medicine,     they largely enter, and in domestic economy, should always be     used in preference to bitter almonds.
10136-8{_}16577{_}The reason for advising     this, is because the kernels do not contain any hydrocyanic or     prussic acid, although it is found in the leaves, flowers, and     bark of the tree.
10136-8{_}16578{_}When young and green, they are preserved in     sugar, like green apricots.
10136-8{_}16579{_}They furnish the almond-oil; and the     farinaceous matter which is left after the oil is expressed,     forms the _pâte d'amandes_ of perfumers.
10136-8{_}16580{_}In the arts, the oil is     employed for the same purposes as the olive-oil, and forms the     basis of kalydor, macassar oil, Gowland's lotion, and many other     articles of that kind vended by perfumers.
10136-8{_}16581{_}In medicine, it is     considered a nutritive, laxative, and an emollient.
10136-8{_}16582{_}SMALL ALMOND PUDDINGS.

10136-8{_}16594{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}16595{_}THE HUSKS OF ALMONDS.--In the environs of Alicante, the husks of     almonds are ground to a powder, and enter into the composition     of common soap, the large quantity of alkaline principle they     contain rendering them suitable for this purpose.
10136-8{_}16596{_}It is said     that in some parts of the south of France, where they are     extensively grown, horses and mules are fed on the green and dry     husks; but, to prevent any evil consequences arising from this     practice, they are mixed with chopped straw or oats.
10136-8{_}16597{_}ALMOND PUFFS.

10136-8{_}16620{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16621{_}_Seasonable_ at any time, but more suitable for a winter pudding.
10136-8{_}16622{_}TREACLE, OR MOLASSES.--Treacle is the uncrystallizable part of     the saccharine juice drained from the Muscovado sugar, and is     either naturally so or rendered uncrystallizable through some     defect in the process of boiling.
10136-8{_}16623{_}As it contains a large     quantity of sweet or saccharine principle and is cheap, it is of     great use as an article of domestic economy.
10136-8{_}16624{_}Children are     especially fond of it; and it is accounted wholesome.
10136-8{_}16625{_}It is also     useful for making beer, rum, and the very dark syrups.

10136-8{_}16632{_}1215; roll the apples in the crust, previously sweetening them with moist sugar, and taking care to join the paste nicely.
10136-8{_}16633{_}When they are formed into round balls, put them on a tin, and bake them for about 1/2 hour, or longer should the apples be very large; arrange them pyramidically on a dish, and sift over them some pounded white sugar.
10136-8{_}16634{_}These may be made richer by using one of the puff-pastes instead of suet.

10136-8{_}16640{_}USES OF THE APPLE.--It is well known that this fruit forms a     very important article of food, in the form of pies and     puddings, and furnishes several delicacies, such as sauces,     marmalades, and jellies, and is much esteemed as a dessert     fruit.
10136-8{_}16641{_}When flattened in the form of round cakes, and baked in     ovens, they are called beefings; and large quantities are     annually dried in the sun in America, as well as in Normandy,     and stored for use during winter, when they may be stewed or     made into pies.
10136-8{_}16642{_}In a roasted state they are remarkably     wholesome, and, it is said, strengthening to a weak stomach.
10136-8{_}16643{_}In     putrid and malignant fevers, when used with the juice of lemons     and currants, they are considered highly efficacious.

10136-8{_}16657{_}[Illustration: APPLE AND BLOSSOM.]
10136-8{_}16658{_}THE APPLE.--The most useful of all the British fruits is the     apple, which is a native of Britain, and may be found in woods     and hedges, in the form of the common wild crab, of which all     our best apples are merely seminal varieties, produced by     culture or particular circumstances.
10136-8{_}16659{_}In most temperate climates     it is very extensively cultivated, and in England, both as     regards variety and quantity, it is excellent and abundant.
10136-8{_}16660{_}Immense supplies are also imported from the United States and     from France.
10136-8{_}16661{_}The apples grown in the vicinity of New York are     universally admitted to be the finest of any; but unless     selected and packed with great care, they are apt to spoil     before reaching England.
10136-8{_}16662{_}BOILED APPLE DUMPLINGS.
10136-8{_}16663{_}1227.
10136-8{_}16664{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 apples, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}16665{_}of suet-crust No.
10136-8{_}16666{_}1215, sugar to taste.
10136-8{_}16667{_}_Mode_.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples without dividing them; sweeten, and roll each apple in a piece of crust, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16668{_}1211; be particular that the paste is nicely joined; put the dumplings into floured cloths, tie them securely, and put them into boiling water.
10136-8{_}16669{_}Keep them boiling from 1/2 to 3/4 hour; remove the cloths, and send them hot and quickly to table.
10136-8{_}16670{_}Dumplings boiled in knitted cloths have a very pretty appearance when they come to table.
10136-8{_}16671{_}The cloths should be made square, just large enough to hold one dumpling, and should be knitted in plain knitting, with _very coarse_ cotton.
10136-8{_}16672{_}_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour, or longer should the dumplings be very large.
10136-8{_}16673{_}_Average cost_, 11/2d.
10136-8{_}16674{_}each.
10136-8{_}16675{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.
10136-8{_}16676{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March, but flavourless after the end of January.
10136-8{_}16677{_}LAMBSWOOL, or LAMASOOL.--This old English beverage is composed     of apples mixed with ale, and seasoned with sugar and spice.
10136-8{_}16678{_}It     takes its name from _Lamaes abhal_, which, in ancient British,     signifies the day of apple fruit, from being drunk on the apple     feast in autumn.
10136-8{_}16679{_}In France, a beverage, called by the Parisians     _raisinée_, is made by boiling any given quantity of new wine,     skimming it as often as fresh scum rises, and, when it is boiled     to half its bulk, straining it.
10136-8{_}16680{_}To this apples, pared and cut     into quarters, are added; the whole is then allowed to simmer     gently, stirring it all the time with a long wooden spoon, till     the apples are thoroughly mixed with the liquor, and the whole     forms a species of marmalade, which is extremely agreeable to     the taste, having a slight flavour of acidity, like lemon mixed     with honey.
10136-8{_}16681{_}RICH BAKED APPLE PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16682{_}I.
10136-8{_}16683{_}1228.

10136-8{_}16686{_}of loaf sugar, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}16687{_}of butter, the rind of 1 lemon, 6 eggs, puff-paste.
10136-8{_}16688{_}_Mode_.--Peel, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce; put them into a stewpan, with only just sufficient water to prevent them from burning, and let them stew until reduced to a pulp.
10136-8{_}16689{_}Weigh the pulp, and to every 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16690{_}add sifted sugar, grated lemon-rind, and 6 well-beaten eggs.
10136-8{_}16691{_}Beat these ingredients well together; then melt the butter, stir it to the other things, put a border of puff-paste round the dish, and bake for rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16692{_}The butter should not be added until the pudding is ready for the oven.
10136-8{_}16693{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.

10136-8{_}16700{_}1229.
10136-8{_}16701{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 large apples, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}16702{_}of moist sugar, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}16703{_}of butter, 4 eggs, 1 pint of bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}16704{_}_Mode_.--Pare, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce, and boil them until reduced to a pulp; then add the butter, melted, and the eggs, which should be well whisked.
10136-8{_}16705{_}Beat up the pudding for 2 or 3 minutes; butter a pie-dish; put in a layer of bread crumbs, then the apple, and then another layer of bread crumbs; flake over these a few tiny pieces of butter, and bake for about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16706{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16707{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}16708{_}3d.
10136-8{_}16709{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16710{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March.
10136-8{_}16711{_}_Note_.--A very good economical pudding may be made merely with apples, boiled and sweetened, with the addition of a few strips of lemon-peel.
10136-8{_}16712{_}A layer of bread crumbs should be placed above and below the apples, and the pudding baked for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}16713{_}CONSTITUENTS OF THE APPLE.--All apples contain sugar, malic     acid, or the acid of apples; mucilage, or gum; woody fibre, and     water; together with some aroma, on which their peculiar flavour     depends.
10136-8{_}16714{_}The hard acid kinds are unwholesome if eaten raw; but     by the process of cooking, a great deal of this acid is     decomposed and converted into sugar.
10136-8{_}16715{_}The sweet and mellow kinds     form a valuable addition to the dessert.
10136-8{_}16716{_}A great part of the     acid juice is converted into sugar as the fruit ripens, and even     after it is gathered, by natural process, termed maturation;     but, when apples decay, the sugar is changed into a bitter     principle, and the mucilage becomes mouldy and offensive.
10136-8{_}16717{_}Old     cheese has a remarkable effect in meliorating the apple when     eaten; probably from the volatile alkali or ammonia of the     cheese neutralizing its acid.
10136-8{_}16718{_}RICH SWEET APPLE PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16719{_}1230.
10136-8{_}16720{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16721{_}of bread crumbs, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16722{_}of suet, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16723{_}of currants, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16724{_}of apples, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16725{_}of moist sugar, 6 eggs, 12 sweet almonds, 1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 wineglassful of brandy.
10136-8{_}16726{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet very fine; wash the currants, dry them, and pick away the stalks and pieces of grit; pare, core, and chop the apple, and grate the bread into fine crumbs, and mince the almonds.
10136-8{_}16727{_}Mix all these ingredients together, adding the sugar and nutmeg; beat up the eggs, omitting the whites of three; stir these to the pudding, and when all is well mixed, add the brandy, and put the pudding into a buttered mould; tie down with a cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil for 3 hours.
10136-8{_}16728{_}_Time_.--3 hours.
10136-8{_}16729{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}16730{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16731{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March.
10136-8{_}16732{_}TO PRESERVE APPLES.--The best mode of preserving apples is to     carry them at once to the fruit-room, where they should be put     upon shelves, covered with white paper, after gently wiping each     of the fruit.
10136-8{_}16733{_}The room should be dry, and well aired, but should     not admit the sun.
10136-8{_}16734{_}The finer and larger kinds of fruit should     not be allowed to touch each other, but should be kept separate.
10136-8{_}16735{_}For this purpose, a number of shallow trays should be provided,     supported by racks or stands above each other.
10136-8{_}16736{_}In very cold     frosty weather, means should be adopted for warming the room.
10136-8{_}16737{_}BAKED APPLE PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16738{_}(_Very Good_.)
10136-8{_}16739{_}1231.
10136-8{_}16740{_}INGREDIENTS.--5 moderate-sized apples, 2 tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped suet, 3 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 pint of milk, a little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}16741{_}_Mode_.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with the milk; add the eggs, which should be well whisked, and put this batter into a well-buttered pie-dish.
10136-8{_}16742{_}Wipe the apples clean, but do not pare them; cut them in halves, and take out the cores; lay them in the batter, rind uppermost; shake the suet on the top, over which, also grate a little nutmeg; bake in a moderate oven for an hour, and cover, when served, with sifted loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}16743{_}This pudding is also very good with the apples pared, sliced, and mixed with the batter.
10136-8{_}16744{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}16745{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}16746{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16747{_}BOILED APPLE PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16748{_}1232.
10136-8{_}16749{_}INGREDIENTS.--Crust No.
10136-8{_}16750{_}1215, apples, sugar to taste, 1 small teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}16751{_}_Mode_.--Make a butter-crust by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16752{_}1213, or a suet one by recipe No.
10136-8{_}16753{_}1215, using for a moderate-sized pudding from 3/4 to 1 lb.
10136-8{_}16754{_}of flour, with the other ingredients in proportion.
10136-8{_}16755{_}Butter a basin; line it with some of the paste; pare, core, and cut the apples into slices, and fill the basin with these; add the sugar, the lemon-peel and juice, and cover with crust; pinch the edges together, flour the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie it securely, and put it into plenty of fast-boiling water.
10136-8{_}16756{_}Let it boil from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, according to the size; then turn it out of the basin and send to table quickly.
10136-8{_}16757{_}Apple puddings may also be boiled in a cloth without a basin; but, when made in this way, must be served without the least delay, as the crust so soon becomes heavy.
10136-8{_}16758{_}Apple pudding is a very convenient dish to have when the dinner-hour is rather uncertain, as it does not spoil by being boiled an extra hour; care, however, must be taken to keep it well covered with the water all the time, and not to allow it to stop boiling.
10136-8{_}16759{_}_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, according to the size of the pudding and the quality of the apples.
10136-8{_}16760{_}_Average cost_, 10d.
10136-8{_}16761{_}_Sufficient_, made with 1 lb.
10136-8{_}16762{_}of flour, for 7 or 8 persons.

10136-8{_}16764{_}APPLE TART OR PIE.
10136-8{_}16765{_}1233.
10136-8{_}16766{_}INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No.
10136-8{_}16767{_}1205 or 1206, apples; to every lb.
10136-8{_}16768{_}of unpared apples allow 2 oz.
10136-8{_}16769{_}of moist sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}16770{_}_Mode_.--Make 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}16771{_}of puff-paste by either of the above-named recipes, place a border of it round the edge of a pie-dish, and fill it with apples pared, cored, and cut into slices; sweeten with moist sugar, add the lemon-peel and juice, and 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water; cover with crust, cut it evenly round close to the edge of the pie-dish, and bake in a hot oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, or rather longer, should the pie be very large.
10136-8{_}16772{_}When it is three-parts done, take it out of the oven, put the white of an egg on a plate, and, with the blade of a knife, whisk it to a froth; brush the pie over with this, then sprinkle upon it some sifted sugar, and then a few drops of water.
10136-8{_}16773{_}Put the pie back into the oven, and finish baking, and be particularly careful that it does not catch or burn, which it is very liable to do after the crust is iced.
10136-8{_}16774{_}If made with a plain crust, the icing may be omitted.
10136-8{_}16775{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour before the crust is iced; 10 to 15 minutes afterwards.
10136-8{_}16776{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}16777{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}16778{_}of apples for a tart for 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16779{_}_Seasonable_ from August to March; but the apples become flavourless after February.
10136-8{_}16780{_}_Note_.--Many things are suggested for the flavouring of apple pie; some say 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of beer, others the same quantity of sherry, which very much improve the taste; whilst the old-fashioned addition of a few cloves is, by many persons, preferred to anything else, as also a few slices of quince.
10136-8{_}16781{_}[Illustration: QUINCE.]
10136-8{_}16782{_}QUINCES.--The environs of Corinth originally produced the most     beautiful quinces, but the plant was subsequently introduced     into Gaul with the most perfect success.
10136-8{_}16783{_}The ancients preserved     the fruit by placing it, with its branches and leaves, in a     vessel filled with honey or sweet wine, which was reduced to     half the quantity by ebullition.
10136-8{_}16784{_}Quinces may be profitably     cultivated in this country as a variety with other fruit-trees,     and may be planted in espaliers or as standards.
10136-8{_}16785{_}A very     fine-flavoured marmalade may be prepared from quinces, and a     small portion of quince in apple pie much improves its flavour.
10136-8{_}16786{_}The French use quinces for flavouring many sauces.
10136-8{_}16787{_}This fruit     has the remarkable peculiarity of exhaling an agreeable odour,     taken singly; but when in any quantity, or when they are stowed     away in a drawer or close room, the pleasant aroma becomes an     intolerable stench, although the fruit may be perfectly sound;     it is therefore desirable that, as but a few quinces are     required for keeping, they should be kept in a high and dry     loft, and out of the way of the rooms used by the family.

10136-8{_}16830{_}The apple, uncooked, is less digestible than the     pear; the degree of digestibility varying according to the     firmness of its texture and flavour.
10136-8{_}16831{_}Very wholesome and     delicious jellies, marmalades, and sweetmeats are prepared from     it.
10136-8{_}16832{_}Entremets of apples are made in great variety.

10136-8{_}16853{_}Divide the apricots in half, scald them until they are soft, and break them up with a spoon, adding a few of the kernels, which should be well pounded in a mortar; then mix the fruit and other ingredients together, put a border of paste round the dish, fill with the mixture, and bake the pudding from 1/2 to 3/4 hour.

10136-8{_}16860{_}1239.
10136-8{_}16861{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 or 14 apricots, sugar to taste, puff-paste or short crust.
10136-8{_}16862{_}_Mode_.--Break the apricots in half, take out the stones, and put them into a pie-dish, in the centre of which place a very small cup or jar, bottom uppermost; sweeten with good moist sugar, but add no water.

10136-8{_}16864{_}Bake from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to size; and if puff-paste is used, glaze it about 10 minutes before the pie is done, and put it into the oven again to set the glaze.
10136-8{_}16865{_}Short crust merely requires a little sifted sugar sprinkled over it before being sent to table.
10136-8{_}16866{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}16867{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 1s.
10136-8{_}16868{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}16869{_}_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October; green ones rather earlier.
10136-8{_}16870{_}_Note_.--Green apricots make very good tarts, but they should be boiled with a little sugar and water before they are covered with the crust.
10136-8{_}16871{_}APRICOTS.--The apricot is indigenous to the plains of Armenia,     but is now cultivated in almost every climate, temperate or     tropical.
10136-8{_}16872{_}There are several varieties.
10136-8{_}16873{_}The skin of this fruit     has a perfumed flavour, highly esteemed.
10136-8{_}16874{_}A good apricot, when     perfectly ripe, is an excellent fruit.
10136-8{_}16875{_}It has been somewhat     condemned for its laxative qualities, but this has possibly     arisen from the fruit having been eaten unripe, or in too great     excess.
10136-8{_}16876{_}Delicate persons should not eat the apricot uncooked,     without a liberal allowance of powdered sugar.
10136-8{_}16877{_}The apricot makes     excellent jam and marmalade, and there are several foreign     preparations of it which are considered great luxuries.
10136-8{_}16878{_}BAKED OR BOILED ARROWROOT PUDDING.
10136-8{_}16879{_}1240.
10136-8{_}16880{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}16881{_}of butter, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, a little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}16882{_}_Mode_.--Mix the arrowroot with as much cold milk as will make it into a smooth batter, moderately thick; put the remainder of the milk into a stewpan with the lemon-peel, and let it infuse for about 1/2 hour; when it boils, strain it gently to the batter, stirring it all the time to keep it smooth; then add the butter; beat this well in until thoroughly mixed, and sweeten with moist sugar.
10136-8{_}16883{_}Put the mixture into a pie-dish, round which has been placed a border of paste, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake the pudding from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, in a moderate oven, or boil it the same length of time in a well-buttered basin.
10136-8{_}16884{_}To enrich this pudding, stir to the other ingredients, just before it is put in the oven, 3 well-whisked eggs, and add a tablespoonful of brandy.
10136-8{_}16885{_}For a nursery pudding, the addition of the latter ingredients will be found quite superfluous, as also the paste round the edge of the dish.
10136-8{_}16886{_}_Time_.--1 to 1-1/4 hour, baked or boiled.
10136-8{_}16887{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}16888{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}16889{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}16890{_}_ARROWROOT_.--In India, and in the colonies, by the process of     rasping, they extract from a vegetable (_Maranta arundinacea_) a     sediment nearly resembling tapioca.
10136-8{_}16891{_}The grated pulp is sifted     into a quantity of water, from which it is afterwards strained     and dried, and the sediment thus produced is called arrowroot.
10136-8{_}16892{_}Its qualities closely resemble those of tapioca.

10136-8{_}16953{_}Nothing is of greater consequence, in the above directions, than attention to the time of boiling, which should never be _less_ than that mentioned.

10136-8{_}16966{_}BARBERRIES (_Berberris vulgaris_.)
10136-8{_}16967{_}--A fruit of such great     acidity, that even birds refuse to eat it.
10136-8{_}16968{_}In this respect, it     nearly approaches the tamarind.
10136-8{_}16969{_}When boiled with sugar, it makes     a very agreeable preserve or jelly, according to the different     modes of preparing it.
10136-8{_}16970{_}Barberries are also used as a dry     sweetmeat, and in sugarplums or comfits; are pickled with     vinegar, and are used for various culinary purposes.
10136-8{_}16971{_}They are     well calculated to allay heat and thirst in persons afflicted     with fevers.
10136-8{_}16972{_}The berries, arranged on bunches of nice curled     parsley, make an exceedingly pretty garnish for supper-dishes,     particularly for white meats, like boiled fowl à la Béchamel,     the three colours, scarlet, green, and white, contrasting so     well, and producing a very good effect.
10136-8{_}16973{_}BAKED BATTER PUDDING.

10136-8{_}16987{_}of currants, a pinch of salt.
10136-8{_}16988{_}_Mode_.--Mix the milk, flour, and eggs to a smooth batter; add a little salt, the suet, and the currants, which should be well washed, picked, and dried; put the mixture into a buttered pie-dish, and bake in a moderate oven for 1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}16989{_}When fresh fruits are in season, this pudding is exceedingly nice, with damsons, plums, red currants, gooseberries, or apples; when made with these, the pudding must be thickly sprinkled over with sifted sugar.
10136-8{_}16990{_}Boiled batter pudding, with fruit, is made in the same manner, by putting the fruit into a buttered basin, and filling it up with batter made in the above proportion, but omitting the suet.
10136-8{_}16991{_}It must be sent quickly to table, and covered plentifully with sifted sugar.
10136-8{_}16992{_}_Time_.--Baked batter pudding, with fruit, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; boiled ditto, 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour, allowing that both are made with the above proportion of batter.

10136-8{_}17002{_}This pudding may also be boiled in a floured cloth that has been wetted in hot water; it will then take a few minutes less than when boiled in a basin.

10136-8{_}17060{_}BREAD.--Bread contains, in its composition, in the form of     vegetable albumen and vegetable fibrine, two of the chief     constituents of flesh, and, in its incombustible constituents,     the salts which are indispensable for sanguification, of the     same quality and in the same proportion as flesh.
10136-8{_}17061{_}But flesh     contains, besides these, a number of substances which are     entirely wanting in vegetable food; and on these peculiar     constituents of flesh depend certain effects, by which it is     essentially distinguished from other articles of food.

10136-8{_}17099{_}This pudding may be very much enriched by adding cream, candied peel, or more eggs than stated above.
10136-8{_}17100{_}It should not be turned out, but sent to table in the pie-dish, and is better for being made about 2 hours before it is baked.

10136-8{_}17106{_}Good fresh butter, used in moderation, is easily     digested; it is softening, nutritious, and fattening, and is far     more easily digested than any other of the oleaginous substances     sometimes used in its place.

10136-8{_}17114{_}Cut the peel into thin slices, and place these in a fanciful device at the bottom of the mould, and fill in the spaces between with currants and sultanas; then add a few slices of sponge cake or French roll; drop a few drops of melted butter on these, and between each layer sprinkle a few currants.
10136-8{_}17115{_}Proceed in this manner until the mould is nearly full; then flavour the milk with nutmeg and grated lemon-rind; add the sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which should be well beaten.
10136-8{_}17116{_}Beat this mixture for a few minutes; then strain it into the mould, which should be quite full; tie a piece of buttered paper over it, and let it stand for 2 hours; then tie it down with a cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil slowly for 1 hour.
10136-8{_}17117{_}In taking it up, let it stand for a minute or two before the cloth is removed; then quickly turn it out of the mould or basin, and serve with sweet sauce separately.
10136-8{_}17118{_}The flavouring of this pudding may be varied by substituting for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or bitter almonds; and it may be made much richer by using cream; but this is not at all necessary.
10136-8{_}17119{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}17120{_}_Average cost_, 1s.

10136-8{_}17152{_}If to be boiled, put the mixture into a buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for 2-1/2 hours: if to be baked, put it into a pie-dish, and bake for nearly an hour; turn it out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over it, and serve.
10136-8{_}17153{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to boil; 1 hour to bake.
10136-8{_}17154{_}_Average cost_, 1s.

10136-8{_}17177{_}1210 or 1211.
10136-8{_}17178{_}_Mode_.--Pick the stalks from the cherries, put them, with the sugar, into a _deep_ pie-dish just capable of holding them, with a small cup placed upside down in the midst of them.
10136-8{_}17179{_}Make a short crust with 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}17180{_}of flour, by either of the recipes 1210 or 1211; lay a border round the edge of the dish; put on the cover, and ornament the edges; bake in a brisk oven from 1/2 hour to 40 minutes; strew finely-sifted sugar over, and serve hot or cold, although the latter is the more usual mode.
10136-8{_}17181{_}It is more economical to make two or three tarts at one time, as the trimmings from one tart answer for lining the edges of the dish for another, and so much paste is not required as when they are made singly.
10136-8{_}17182{_}Unless for family use, never make fruit pies in very _large_ dishes; select them, however, as deep as possible.
10136-8{_}17183{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes.

10136-8{_}17188{_}[Illustration: CHERRY.]
10136-8{_}17189{_}CHERRIES.--According to Lucullus, the cherry-tree was known in     Asia in the year of Rome 680.
10136-8{_}17190{_}Seventy different species of     cherries, wild and cultivated, exist, which are distinguishable     from each other by the difference of their form, size, and     colour.
10136-8{_}17191{_}The French distil from cherries a liqueur Darned     _kirsch-waser_ (_eau de cérises_); the Italians prepare, from a     cherry called marusca, the liqueur named _marasquin_, sweeter     and more agreeable than the former.
10136-8{_}17192{_}The most wholesome cherries     have a tender and delicate skin; those with a hard skin should     be very carefully masticated.
10136-8{_}17193{_}Sweetmeats, syrups, tarts,     entremets, &c., of cherries, are universally approved.
10136-8{_}17194{_}COLD PUDDING.

10136-8{_}17221{_}of currants, rather more than 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}17222{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely, mix it with the flour, and add the currants, which should be nicely washed, picked, and dried; mix the whole to a limp paste with the water (if wanted very nice, use milk); divide it into 7 or 8 dumplings; tie them in cloths, and boil for 1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}17223{_}They may be boiled without a cloth: they should then be made into round balls, and dropped into boiling water, and should be moved about at first, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.
10136-8{_}17224{_}Serve with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar.

10136-8{_}17228{_}[Illustration: ZANTE CURRANTS.]
10136-8{_}17229{_}ZANTE CURRANTS.--The dried fruit which goes by the name of     currants in grocers' shops is not a currant really, but a small     kind of grape, chiefly cultivated in the Morea and the Ionian     Islands, Corfu, Zante, &c. Those of Zante are cultivated in an     immense plain, under the shelter of mountains, on the shore of     the island, where the sun has great power, and brings them to     maturity.
10136-8{_}17230{_}When gathered and dried by the sun and air, on mats,     they are conveyed to magazines, heaped together, and left to     cake, until ready for shipping.
10136-8{_}17231{_}They are then dug out by iron     crowbars, trodden into casks, and exported.
10136-8{_}17232{_}The fertile vale of     "Zante the woody" produces about 9,000,000 lbs.
10136-8{_}17233{_}of currants     annually.
10136-8{_}17234{_}In cakes and puddings this delicious little grape is     most extensively used; in fact, we could not make a plum pudding     without the currant.

10136-8{_}17240{_}of suet, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}17241{_}of currants, milk.
10136-8{_}17242{_}_Mode_.--Wash the currants, dry them thoroughly, and pick away any stalks or grit; chop the suet finely; mix all the ingredients together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the pudding into a stiff batter; tie it up in a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil for 3-1/2 hours; serve with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar.
10136-8{_}17243{_}_Time_.--3-1/2 hours.

10136-8{_}17252{_}1213.
10136-8{_}17253{_}_Mode_.--Make, with 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}17254{_}of flour, either a suet crust or butter crust (the former is usually made); butter a basin, and line it with part of the crust; put in the currants, which should be stripped from the stalks, and sprinkle the sugar over them; put the cover of the pudding on; make the edges very secure, that the juice does not escape; tie it down with a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.
10136-8{_}17255{_}Boiled without a basin, allow 1/2 hour less.
10136-8{_}17256{_}We have allowed rather a large proportion of sugar; but we find fruit puddings are so much more juicy and palatable when _well sweetened_ before they are boiled, besides being more economical.
10136-8{_}17257{_}A few raspberries added to red-currant pudding are a very nice addition: about 1/2 pint would be sufficient for the above quantity of fruit.
10136-8{_}17258{_}Fruit puddings are very delicious if, when they are turned out of the basin, the crust is browned with a salamander, or put into a very hot oven for a few minutes to colour it: this makes it crisp on the surface.

10136-8{_}17263{_}[Illustration: CURRANTS.]
10136-8{_}17264{_}CURRANTS.--The utility of currants, red, black, or white, has     long been established in domestic economy.
10136-8{_}17265{_}The juice of the red     species, if boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar, forms an     agreeable substance called _currant jelly_, much employed in     sauces, and very valuable in the cure of sore throats and colds.
10136-8{_}17266{_}The French mix it with sugar and water, and thus form an     agreeable beverage.
10136-8{_}17267{_}The juice of currants is a valuable remedy     in obstructions of the bowels; and, in febrile complaints, it is     useful on account of its readily quenching thirst, and for its     cooling effect on the stomach.
10136-8{_}17268{_}White and flesh-coloured     currants have, with the exception of the fullness of flavour, in     every respect, the same qualities as the red species.
10136-8{_}17269{_}Both white     and red currants are pleasant additions to the dessert, but the     black variety is mostly used for culinary and medicinal     purposes, especially in the form of jelly for quinsies.
10136-8{_}17270{_}The     leaves of the black currant make a pleasant tea.
10136-8{_}17271{_}RED-CURRANT AND RASPBERRY TART.
10136-8{_}17272{_}1267.
10136-8{_}17273{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of picked currants, 1/2 pint of raspberries, 3 heaped tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, 1/2 lb.

10136-8{_}17276{_}This tart is more generally served cold than hot.

10136-8{_}17281{_}[Illustration: RASPBERRY.]
10136-8{_}17282{_}RASPBERRIES.--There are two sorts of raspberries, the red and     the white.
10136-8{_}17283{_}Both the scent and flavour of this fruit are very     refreshing, and the berry itself is exceedingly wholesome, and     invaluable to people of a nervous or bilious temperament.
10136-8{_}17284{_}We are     not aware, however, of its being cultivated with the same amount     of care which is bestowed upon some other of the berry tribe,     although it is far from improbable that a more careful     cultivation would not be repaid by a considerable improvement in     the size and flavour of the berry; neither, as an eating fruit,     is it so universally esteemed as the strawberry, with whose     lusciousness and peculiarly agreeable flavour it can bear no     comparison.
10136-8{_}17285{_}In Scotland, it is found in large quantities,     growing wild, and is eagerly sought after, in the woods, by     children.
10136-8{_}17286{_}Its juice is rich and abundant, and to many, extremely     agreeable.
10136-8{_}17287{_}BAKED CUSTARD PUDDING.
10136-8{_}17288{_}1268.
10136-8{_}17289{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, the rind of 1/4 lemon, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}17290{_}of moist sugar, 4 eggs.
10136-8{_}17291{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let this infuse for about 4 hour, or until the milk is well flavoured; whisk the eggs, yolks and whites; pour the milk to them, stirring all the while; then have ready a pie-dish, lined at the edge with paste ready baked; strain the custard into the dish, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake in a _very slow_ oven for about 1/2 hour, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}17292{_}The flavour of this pudding may be varied by substituting bitter almonds for the lemon-rind; and it may be very much enriched by using half cream and half milk, and doubling the quantity of eggs.

10136-8{_}17301{_}_Mode_.--Flavour the milk by infusing in it a little lemon-rind or cinnamon; whisk the eggs, stir the flour gradually to these, and pour over them the milk, and stir the mixture well.
10136-8{_}17302{_}Butter a basin that will exactly hold it; put in the custard, and tie a floured cloth over; plunge it into boiling water, and turn it about for a few minutes, to prevent the flour from settling in one part.
10136-8{_}17303{_}Boil it slowly for 1/2 hour; turn it out of the basin, and serve.

10136-8{_}17315{_}If puff-crust is used, about 10 minutes before the pie is done, take it out of the oven, brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a froth with the blade of a knife; strew some sifted sugar over, and a few drops of water, and put the tart back to finish baking: with short crust, a little plain sifted sugar, sprinkled over, is all that will be required.

10136-8{_}17322{_}It combines sugary and acid qualities in happy     proportions, when full ripe.
10136-8{_}17323{_}It is a fruit easily cultivated;     and, if budded nine inches from the ground on vigorous stocks,     it will grow several feet high in the first year, and make fine     standards the year following.
10136-8{_}17324{_}Amongst the list of the best sorts     of baking plums, the damson stands first, not only on account of     the abundance of its juice, but also on account of its soon     softening.

10136-8{_}17515{_}GOOSEBERRIES.--The red and the white are the two principal     varieties of gooseberries.
10136-8{_}17516{_}The red are rather the more acid;     but, when covered with white sugar, are most wholesome, because     the sugar neutralizes their acidity.
10136-8{_}17517{_}Red gooseberries make an     excellent jelly, which is light and refreshing, but not very     nourishing.
10136-8{_}17518{_}It is good for bilious and plethoric persons, and to     invalids generally who need light and digestible food.
10136-8{_}17519{_}It is a     fruit from which many dishes might be made.
10136-8{_}17520{_}All sorts of     gooseberries are agreeable when stewed, and, in this country     especially, there is no fruit so universally in favour.

10136-8{_}17752{_}MACARONI is composed of wheaten flour, flavoured with other     articles, and worked up with water into a paste, to which, by a     peculiar process, a tubular or pipe form is given, in order that     it may cook more readily in hot water.
10136-8{_}17753{_}That of smaller diameter     than macaroni (which is about the thickness of a goose-quill) is     called _vermicelli_; and when smaller still, _fidelini_.
10136-8{_}17754{_}The     finest is made from the flour of the hard-grained Black-Sea     wheat.
10136-8{_}17755{_}Macaroni is the principal article of food in many parts     of Italy, particularly Naples, where the best is manufactured,     and from whence, also, it is exported in considerable     quantities.

10136-8{_}17906{_}of currants, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}17907{_}of stoned raisins, 1/2 pint of whipped cream, 3 eggs.
10136-8{_}17908{_}_Mode_.--Blanch the chestnuts in boiling water, remove the husks, and pound them in a mortar until perfectly smooth, adding a few spoonfuls of syrup.
10136-8{_}17909{_}Then rub them through a fine sieve, and mix them in a basin with a pint of syrup made from 1 lb.
10136-8{_}17910{_}of sugar, clarified, and flavoured with vanilla, 1 pint of cream, and the yolks of 12 eggs.
10136-8{_}17911{_}Set this mixture over a slow fire, stirring it _without ceasing_, and just as it begins to boil, take it off and pass it through a tammy.
10136-8{_}17912{_}When it is cold, put it into a freezing-pot, adding the Maraschino, and make the mixture set; then add the sliced citron, the currants, and stoned raisins (these two latter should be soaked the day previously in Maraschino and sugar pounded with vanilla); the whole thus mingled, add a plateful of whipped cream mixed with the whites of 3 eggs, beaten to a froth with a little syrup.
10136-8{_}17913{_}When the pudding is perfectly frozen, put it into a pineapple-shaped mould; close the lid, place it again in the freezing-pan, covered over with pounded ice and saltpetre, and let it remain until required for table; then turn the pudding out, and serve.

10136-8{_}17922{_}Rub the rinds of 2 of the oranges on sugar, and add this, with the juice of the remainder, to the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}17923{_}Beat up the eggs, stir them in, sweeten to taste, and put the mixture into a pie-dish previously lined with puff-paste.
10136-8{_}17924{_}Bake for rather more than 1/2 hour; turn it out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over, and serve.

10136-8{_}17929{_}[Illustration: ORANGE.]
10136-8{_}17930{_}ORANGE (_Citrus Aurantium_).--The principal varieties are the     sweet, or China orange, and the bitter, or Seville orange; the     Maltese is also worthy of notice, from its red blood-like pulp.
10136-8{_}17931{_}The orange is extensively cultivated in the south of Europe, and     in Devonshire, on walls with a south aspect, it bears an     abundance of fruit.
10136-8{_}17932{_}So great is the increase in the demand for     the orange, and so ample the supply, that it promises to rival     the apple in its popularity.
10136-8{_}17933{_}The orange-tree is considered young     at the age of a hundred years.
10136-8{_}17934{_}The pulp of the orange consists     of a collection of oblong vesicles filled with a sugary and     refreshing juice.
10136-8{_}17935{_}The orange blossom is proverbially chosen for     the bridal wreath, and, from the same flower, an essential oil     is extracted hardly less esteemed than the celebrated ottar of     roses.
10136-8{_}17936{_}Of all marmalades, that made from the Seville orange is     the best.
10136-8{_}17937{_}The peel and juice of the orange are much used in     culinary preparations.
10136-8{_}17938{_}From oranges are made preserves,     comfitures, jellies, glacés, sherbet, liqueurs, and syrups.
10136-8{_}17939{_}The     juice of the orange in a glass _d'eau sucrée_ makes a refreshing     and wholesome drink.
10136-8{_}17940{_}From the clarified pulp of the orange the     French make a delicious jelly, which they serve in small pots,     and call _crême_.
10136-8{_}17941{_}The rasped peel of the orange is used in     several sweet _entremets_, to which it communicates its perfume.
10136-8{_}17942{_}The confectioner manufactures a variety of dainties from all     parts of the orange.
10136-8{_}17943{_}Confections of orange-peel are excellent     tonics and stomachics.
10136-8{_}17944{_}Persons with delicate stomachs should     abstain from oranges at dessert, because their acidity is likely     to derange the digestive organs.
10136-8{_}17945{_}SMALL DISHES OF PASTRY FOR ENTREMETS, SUPPER-DISHES, &c.  FANCHONNETTES, or CUSTARD TARTLETS.

10136-8{_}17954{_}Put them in the oven again to set the icing, but be particular that they do not scorch: when the icing looks crisp, they are done.
10136-8{_}17955{_}Arrange them, piled high in the centre, on a white napkin, and garnish the dish, and in between the tartlets, with strips of bright jelly, or very firmly-made preserve.
10136-8{_}17956{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to bake the tartlets; 5 minutes after being iced.

10136-8{_}17960{_}_Note_.--The icing may be omitted on the top of the tartlets, and a spoonful of any kind of preserve put at the bottom of the custard instead: this varies both the flavour and appearance of this dish.

10136-8{_}17969{_}Brush the larger pieces over with the white of an egg, and place one of the smaller pieces on each.
10136-8{_}17970{_}Blanch and cut the almonds into strips lengthwise; press them slanting into the paste closely round the rings; and when they are all completed, sift over some pounded sugar, and bake for about 1/4 hour or 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}17971{_}Garnish between the almonds with strips of apple jelly, and place in the centre of the ring a small quantity of strawberry jam; pile them high on the dish, and serve.

10136-8{_}17994{_}When cold, cut it into strips; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and serve.
10136-8{_}17995{_}These strips, cut about 2 inches long, piled in circular rows, and a plateful of flavoured whipped cream poured in the middle, make a very pretty dish.

10136-8{_}18007{_}_Mode_.--Blanch the almonds, and chop them fine; rub the sugar on the lemon-rind, and pound it in a mortar; mix this with the almonds and the white of the egg.
10136-8{_}18008{_}Roll some puff-paste out; cut it in any shape that may be preferred, such as diamonds, rings, ovals, &c., and spread the above mixture over the paste.

10136-8{_}18018{_}_Mode_.--Roll some good puff-paste out thin, and cut it into 2-1/2-inch squares; brush each square over with the white of an egg, then fold down the corners, so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of paste; slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg, sift over sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}18019{_}When they are done, make a little hole in the middle of the paste, and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant jelly.
10136-8{_}18020{_}Pile them high in the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve the tartlets are filled with.

10136-8{_}18024{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 dishes of pastry.
10136-8{_}18025{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}18026{_}_Note_.--It should be borne in mind, that, for all dishes of small pastry, such as the preceding, trimmings of puff-pasty, left from larger tarts, answer as well as making the paste expressly.
10136-8{_}18027{_}PUITS d'AMOUR, or PUFF-PASTE RINGS.
10136-8{_}18028{_}1321.

10136-8{_}18035{_}Dish them high on a napkin, and serve.
10136-8{_}18036{_}So many pretty dishes of pastry may be made by stamping puff-paste out with fancy cutters, and filling the pieces, when baked, with jelly or preserve, that our space will not allow us to give a separate recipe for each of them; but, as they are all made from one paste, and only the shape and garnishing varied, perhaps it is not necessary, and by exercising a little ingenuity, variety may always be obtained.
10136-8{_}18037{_}Half-moons, leaves, diamonds, stars, shamrocks, rings, etc., are the most appropriate shapes for fancy pastry.

10136-8{_}18049{_}_Mode_.--Pare, core, and mince the apples into small pieces, and mix them with the other dry ingredients; beat up the eggs, moisten the mixture with these, and beat it well; stir in the brandy, and put the pudding into a buttered mould; tie it down with a cloth, boil for 1-1/2 hour, and serve with sweet sauce.
10136-8{_}18050{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}18058{_}Tie them loosely in a clean cloth, leaving a little room for them to swell, and put them on to boil in cold rain-water, allowing 2-1/2 hours after the water has simmered up.
10136-8{_}18059{_}When the peas are tender, take them up and drain; rub them through a colander with a wooden spoon; add the butter, eggs, pepper, and salt; beat all well together for a few minutes, until the ingredients are well incorporated; then tie them tightly in a floured cloth; boil the pudding for another hour, turn it on to the dish, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}18060{_}This pudding should always be sent to table with boiled leg of pork, and is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to boiled beef.
10136-8{_}18061{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to boil the peas, tied loosely in the cloth; 1 hour for the pudding.
10136-8{_}18062{_}_Average cost_, 6d.

10136-8{_}18071{_}of suet, 2 eggs, 1 pint of milk, a few slices of candied peel.
10136-8{_}18072{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the flour, currants, stoned raisins, and candied peel; moisten with the well-beaten eggs, and add sufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of very thick batter.
10136-8{_}18073{_}Put it into a buttered dish, and bake in a good oven from 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours; turn it out, strew sifted sugar over, and serve.
10136-8{_}18074{_}For a very plain pudding, use only half the quantity of fruit, omit the eggs, and substitute milk or water for them.
10136-8{_}18075{_}The above ingredients make a large family pudding; for a small one, half the quantity would be found ample; but it must be baked quite 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}18076{_}_Time_.--Large pudding, 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours; half the size, 1-1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}18081{_}[Illustration: RAISIN-GRAPE.]
10136-8{_}18082{_}RAISIN GRAPE.--All the kinds of raisins have much the same     virtues; they are nutritive and balsamic, but they are very     subject to fermentation with juices of any kind; and hence, when     eaten immoderately, they often bring on colics.
10136-8{_}18083{_}There are many     varieties of grape used for raisins; the fruit of Valencia is     that mostly dried for culinary purposes, whilst most of the     table kinds are grown in Malaga, and called Muscatels.
10136-8{_}18084{_}The     finest of all table raisins come from Provence or Italy; the     most esteemed of all are those of Roquevaire; they are very     large and very sweet.
10136-8{_}18085{_}This sort is rarely eaten by any but the     most wealthy.
10136-8{_}18086{_}The dried Malaga, or Muscatel raisins, which come     to this country packed in small boxes, and nicely preserved in     bunches, are variable in their quality, but mostly of a rich     flavour, when new, juicy, and of a deep purple hue.

10136-8{_}18100{_}Tie it loosely in a cloth, or, if put in a basin, do not quite fill it, as the pudding should have room to swell, and boil it for 4 hours.

10136-8{_}18108{_}AN UNRIVALLED PLUM-PUDDING.
10136-8{_}18109{_}1326.
10136-8{_}18110{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18111{_}of muscatel raisins, 1-3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18112{_}of currants, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}18113{_}of sultana raisins, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}18114{_}of the finest moist sugar, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}18115{_}of bread crumbs, 16 eggs, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}18116{_}of finely-chopped suet, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}18117{_}of mixed candied peel, the rind of 2 lemons, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}18118{_}of ground nutmeg, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}18119{_}of ground cinnamon, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}18120{_}of pounded bitter almonds, 1/4 pint of brandy.
10136-8{_}18121{_}_Mode_.--Stone and cut up the raisins, but do not chop them; wash and dry the currants, and cut the candied peel into thin slices.
10136-8{_}18122{_}Mix all the dry ingredients well together, and moisten with the eggs, which should be well beaten and strained, to the pudding; stir in the brandy, and, when all is thoroughly mixed, well butter and flour a stout new pudding-cloth; put in the pudding, tie it down very tightly and closely, boil from 6 to 8 hours, and serve with brandy-sauce.
10136-8{_}18123{_}A few sweet almonds, blanched and cut in strips, and stuck on the pudding, ornament it prettily.
10136-8{_}18124{_}This quantity may be divided and boiled in buttered moulds.
10136-8{_}18125{_}For small families this is the most desirable way, as the above will be found to make a pudding of rather large dimensions.
10136-8{_}18126{_}_Time_.--6 to 8 hours.
10136-8{_}18127{_}_Average cost_, 7s.
10136-8{_}18128{_}6d.
10136-8{_}18129{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}18130{_}_Sufficient_ for 12 or 14 persons.
10136-8{_}18131{_}_Note_.--The muscatel raisins can be purchased at a cheap rate loose (not in bunches): they are then scarcely higher in price than the ordinary raisins, and impart a much richer flavour to the pudding.
10136-8{_}18132{_}[Illustration:  SULTANA GRAPE.]
10136-8{_}18133{_}SULTANA GRAPE.--We have elsewhere stated that the small black     grape grown in Corinth and the Ionian Isles is, when dried, the     common currant of the grocers' shops; the white or yellow grape,     grown in the same places, is somewhat larger than the black     variety, and is that which produces the Sultana raisin.
10136-8{_}18134{_}It has     been called Sultana from its delicate qualities and unique     growth: the finest are those of Smyrna.
10136-8{_}18135{_}They have not sufficient     flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and     cakes, but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing, that is to     say, for introducing in company with the richer sorts of     Valencias or Muscatels.
10136-8{_}18136{_}In white puddings, or cakes, too, where     the whiteness must be preserved, the Sultana raisin should be     used.
10136-8{_}18137{_}But the greatest value of this fruit in the _cuisine_ is     that of its saving labour; for it has no stones.
10136-8{_}18138{_}Half Muscatels     and half Sultanas are an admirable mixture for general purposes.
10136-8{_}18139{_}A PLAIN CHRISTMAS PUDDING FOR CHILDREN.
10136-8{_}18140{_}1327.
10136-8{_}18141{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.

10136-8{_}18143{_}of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18144{_}of stoned raisins, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18145{_}of currants, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18146{_}of suet, 3 or 4 eggs, milk, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}18147{_}of candied peel, 1 teaspoonful of powdered allspice, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}18148{_}_Mode_.--Let the suet be finely chopped, the raisins stoned, and the currants well washed, picked, and dried.
10136-8{_}18149{_}Mix these with the other dry ingredients, and stir all well together; beat and strain the eggs to the pudding, stir these in, and add just sufficient milk to make it mix properly.
10136-8{_}18150{_}Tie it up in a well-floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil for at least 5 hours.
10136-8{_}18151{_}Serve with a sprig of holly placed in the middle of the pudding, and a little pounded sugar sprinkled over it.
10136-8{_}18152{_}_Time_.--5 hours.

10136-8{_}18156{_}_Seasonable_ at Christmas.
10136-8{_}18157{_}RAISINS.--Raisins are grapes, prepared by suffering them to     remain on the vine until they are perfectly ripe, and then     drying them in the sun or by the heat of an oven.
10136-8{_}18158{_}The sun-dried     grapes are sweet, the oven-dried of an acid flavour.
10136-8{_}18159{_}The common     way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches     of them together, whilst yet on the vine, and dip them into a     hot lixivium of wood-ashes mixed with a little of the oil of     olives: this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle, after which     they are left on the vine three or four days, separated, on     sticks in a horizontal situation, and then dried in the sun at     leisure, after being cut from the tree.

10136-8{_}18165{_}of currants, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18166{_}of mixed peel, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18167{_}of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18168{_}of suet, 8 eggs, 1 wineglassful of brandy.
10136-8{_}18169{_}[Illustration: CHRISTMAS PLUM-PUDDING IN MOULD.]
10136-8{_}18170{_}_Mode_.--Stone and cut the raisins in halves, but do not chop them; wash, pick, and dry the currants, and mince the suet finely; cut the candied peel into thin slices, and grate down the bread into fine crumbs.
10136-8{_}18171{_}When all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them well together; then moisten the mixture with the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the brandy; stir well, that everything may be very thoroughly blended, and _press_ the pudding into a buttered mould; tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours.
10136-8{_}18172{_}It may be boiled in a cloth without a mould, and will require the same time allowed for cooking.
10136-8{_}18173{_}As Christmas puddings are usually made a few days before they are required for table, when the pudding is taken out of the pot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or saucer underneath to catch the water that may drain from it.
10136-8{_}18174{_}The day it is to be eaten, plunge it into boiling water, and keep it boiling for at least 2 hours; then turn it out of the mould, and serve with brandy-sauce.
10136-8{_}18175{_}On Christmas-day a sprig of holly is usually placed in the middle of the pudding, and about a wineglassful of brandy poured round it, which, at the moment of serving, is lighted, and the pudding thus brought to table encircled in flame.
10136-8{_}18176{_}_Time_.--5 or 6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours the day it is to be served.
10136-8{_}18177{_}_Average cost_, 4s.
10136-8{_}18178{_}_Sufficient_ for a quart mould for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}18179{_}_Seasonable_ on the 25th of December, and on various festive occasions till March.
10136-8{_}18180{_}_Note_.--Five or six of these puddings should be made at one time, as they will keep good for many weeks, and in cases where unexpected guests arrive, will be found an acceptable, and, as it only requires warming through, a quickly-prepared dish.
10136-8{_}18181{_}Moulds of every shape and size are manufactured for these puddings, and may be purchased of Messrs. R. & J.

10136-8{_}18183{_}BRANDY is the alcoholic or spirituous portion of wine, separated     from the aqueous part, the colouring matter, &c., by     distillation.
10136-8{_}18184{_}The word is of German origin, and in its German     form, _brantuein_, signifies burnt wine, or wine that has     undergone the action of fire; brandies, so called, however, have     been made from potatoes, carrots, beetroot, pears, and other     vegetable substances; but they are all inferior to true brandy.
10136-8{_}18185{_}Brandy is prepared in most wine countries, but that of France is     the most esteemed.
10136-8{_}18186{_}It is procured not only by distilling the     wine itself, but also by fermenting and distilling the _marc_,     or residue of the pressings of the grape.
10136-8{_}18187{_}It is procured     indifferently from red or white wine, and different wines yield     very different proportions of it, the strongest, of course,     giving the largest quantity.
10136-8{_}18188{_}Brandy obtained from marc has a     more acrid taste than that from wine.
10136-8{_}18189{_}The celebrated brandy of     Cognac, a town in the department of Charente, and that brought     from Andraye, seem to owe their excellence from being made from     white wine.
10136-8{_}18190{_}Like other spirit, brandy is colourless when     recently distilled; by mere keeping, however, owing, probably,     to some change in the soluble matter contained in it, it     acquires a slight colour, which is much increased by keeping in     casks, and is made of the required intensity by the addition of     burnt sugar or other colouring matter.
10136-8{_}18191{_}What is called _British     brandy_ is not, in fact, brandy, which is the name, as we have     said, of a spirit distilled from _wine;_ but is a spirit made     chiefly from malt spirit, with the addition of mineral acids and     various flavouring ingredients, the exact composition being kept     secret.
10136-8{_}18192{_}It is distilled somewhat extensively in this country;     real brandy scarcely at all.
10136-8{_}18193{_}The brandies imported into England     are chiefly from Bordeaux, Rochelle, and Cognac.
10136-8{_}18194{_}A POUND PLUM-PUDDING.
10136-8{_}18195{_}1329.
10136-8{_}18196{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}18197{_}of suet, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}18198{_}of currants, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}18199{_}of stoned raisins, 8 eggs, 1/2 grated nutmeg, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}18200{_}of sliced candied peel, 1 teaspoonful of ground ginger, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18201{_}of bread crumbs, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18202{_}of flour, 1/2 pint of milk.
10136-8{_}18203{_}[Illustration: BAKED PUDDING OR CAKE-MOULD.]
10136-8{_}18204{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the dry ingredients; stir these well together, and add the well-beaten eggs and milk to moisten with.
10136-8{_}18205{_}Beat up the mixture well, and should the above proportion of milk not be found sufficient to make it of the proper consistency, a little more should be added.
10136-8{_}18206{_}Press the pudding into a mould, tie it in a floured cloth, and boil for 5 hours, or rather longer, and serve with brandy-sauce.
10136-8{_}18207{_}_Time_.--5 hours, or longer.
10136-8{_}18208{_}_Average cost_, 3s.
10136-8{_}18209{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}18210{_}_Seasonable_ in winter.
10136-8{_}18211{_}_Note_.--The above pudding may be baked instead of boiled; it should be put into a buttered mould or tin, and baked for about 2 hours; a smaller one would take about 1-1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}18212{_}CITRON.--The fruit of the citron-tree (_Citrus medica_) is     acidulous, antiseptic, and antiscorbutic: it excites the     appetite, and stops vomiting, and, like lemon-juice, has been     greatly extolled in chronic rheumatism, gout, and scurvy.
10136-8{_}18213{_}Mixed     with cordials, it is used as an antidote to the _machineel     poison_.
10136-8{_}18214{_}The candied peel is prepared in the same manner as     orange or lemon-peel; that is to say, the peel is boiled in     water until quite soft, and then suspended in concentrated syrup     (in the cold), after which it is either dried in a current of     warm air, or in a stove, at a heat not exceeding 120°     Fahrenheit.
10136-8{_}18215{_}The syrup must be kept fully saturated with sugar by     reboiling it once or twice during the process.
10136-8{_}18216{_}It may be dusted     with powdered lump sugar, if necessary.
10136-8{_}18217{_}The citron is supposed     to be the Median, Assyrian, or Persian apple of the Greeks.
10136-8{_}18218{_}It     is described by Risso as having a majestic appearance, its     shining leaves and rosy flowers being succeeded by fruit whose     beauty and size astonish the observer, whilst their odour     gratifies his senses.
10136-8{_}18219{_}In China there is an enormous variety, but     the citron is cultivated in all orange-growing countries.
10136-8{_}18220{_}PLUM-PUDDING OF FRESH FRUIT.

10136-8{_}18224{_}1-1/2 pint of Orleans or any other kind of plum, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18225{_}of moist sugar.
10136-8{_}18226{_}_Mode_.--Line a pudding-basin with suet crust rolled out to the thickness of about 1/2 inch; fill the basin with the fruit, put in the sugar, and cover with crust.
10136-8{_}18227{_}Fold the edges over, and pinch them together, to prevent the juice escaping.
10136-8{_}18228{_}Tie over a floured cloth, put the pudding into boiling water, and boil from 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
10136-8{_}18229{_}Turn it out of the basin, and serve quickly.

10136-8{_}18233{_}_Seasonable_, with various kinds of plums, from the beginning of August to the beginning of October.
10136-8{_}18234{_}[Illustration: PLUM.]
10136-8{_}18235{_}PLUMS.--Almost all the varieties of the cultivated plum are     agreeable and refreshing: it is not a nourishing fruit, and if     indulged in to excess, when unripe, is almost certain to cause     diarrhoea and cholera.
10136-8{_}18236{_}Weak and delicate persons had better     abstain from plums altogether.
10136-8{_}18237{_}The modes of preparing plums are     as numerous as the varieties of the fruit.
10136-8{_}18238{_}The objections raised     against raw plums do not apply to the cooked fruit, which even     the invalid may eat in moderation.

10136-8{_}18259{_}of butter, mashed potatoes.
10136-8{_}18260{_}[Illustration: POTATO-PASTY PAN.]
10136-8{_}18261{_}_Mode_.--Place the meat, cut in small pieces, at the bottom of the pan; season it with pepper and salt, and add the gravy and butter broken, into small pieces.
10136-8{_}18262{_}Put on the perforated plate, with its valve-pipe screwed on, and fill up the whole space to the top of the tube with nicely-mashed potatoes mixed with a little milk, and finish the surface of them in any ornamental manner.
10136-8{_}18263{_}If carefully baked, the potatoes will be covered with a delicate brown crust, retaining all the savoury steam rising from the meat.
10136-8{_}18264{_}Send it to table as it comes from the oven, with a napkin folded round it.
10136-8{_}18265{_}_Time_.--40 to 60 minutes.
10136-8{_}18266{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}18267{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}18268{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}18269{_}POTATO PUDDING.
10136-8{_}18270{_}1333.
10136-8{_}18271{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18272{_}of mashed potatoes, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}18273{_}of butter, 2 eggs, 1/4 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt, the juice and rind of 1 small lemon, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}18274{_}of sugar.
10136-8{_}18275{_}_Mode_.--Boil sufficient potatoes to make 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18276{_}when mashed; add to these the butter, eggs, milk, sherry, lemon-juice, and sugar; mince the lemon-peel very finely, and beat all the ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}18277{_}Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for rather more than 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}18278{_}To enrich it, add a few pounded almonds, and increase the quantity of eggs and butter.
10136-8{_}18279{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour, or rather longer.

10136-8{_}18283{_}TO ICE OR GLAZE PASTRY.
10136-8{_}18284{_}1334.
10136-8{_}18285{_}To glaze pastry, which is the usual method adopted for meat or raised pies, break an egg, separate the yolk from the white, and beat the former for a short time.
10136-8{_}18286{_}Then, when the pastry is nearly baked, take it out of the oven, brush it over with this beaten yolk of egg, and put it back in the oven to set the glaze.
10136-8{_}18287{_}1335.
10136-8{_}18288{_}To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit tarts and sweet dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with the blade of a knife beat it to a stiff froth.
10136-8{_}18289{_}When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over with this, and sift over some pounded sugar; put it back into the oven to set the glaze, and, in a few minutes, it will be done.
10136-8{_}18290{_}Great care should be taken that the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which it is very liable to do after the icing is laid on.
10136-8{_}18291{_}_Sufficient_--Allow 1 egg and 1-1/8 oz.
10136-8{_}18292{_}of sugar to glaze 3 tarts.
10136-8{_}18293{_}[Illustration: SUGAR CANES.]
10136-8{_}18294{_}SUGAR has been happily called "the honey of reeds."
10136-8{_}18295{_}The     sugar-cane appears to be originally a native of the East Indies.
10136-8{_}18296{_}The Chinese have cultivated it for 2,000 years.
10136-8{_}18297{_}The Egyptians,     Phoenicians, and Jews knew nothing about it.
10136-8{_}18298{_}The Greek     physicians are the first who speak of it.
10136-8{_}18299{_}It was not till the     year 1471 that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying     brown sugar and making loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}18300{_}He gained an immense fortune     by this discovery.
10136-8{_}18301{_}Our supplies are now obtained from Barbadoes,     Jamaica, Mauritius, Ceylon, the East and West Indies generally,     and the United States; but the largest supplies come from Cuba.
10136-8{_}18302{_}Sugar is divided into the following classes:--Refined sugar,     white clayed, brown clayed, brown raw, and molasses.
10136-8{_}18303{_}The     sugarcane grows to the height of six, twelve, or even sometimes     twenty feet.
10136-8{_}18304{_}It is propagated from cuttings, requires much     hoeing and weeding, giving employment to thousands upon     thousands of slaves in the slave countries, and attains maturity     in twelve or thirteen months.
10136-8{_}18305{_}When ripe, it is cut down close to     the stole, the stems are divided into lengths of about three     feet, which are made up into bundles, and carried to the mill,     to be crushed between rollers.
10136-8{_}18306{_}In the process of crushing, the     juice runs down into a reservoir, from which, after a while, it     is drawn through a siphon; that is to say, the clear fluid is     taken from the scum.
10136-8{_}18307{_}This fluid undergoes several processes of     drying and refining; the methods varying in different     manufactories.
10136-8{_}18308{_}There are some large establishments engaged in     sugar-refining in the neighbourhoods of Blackwall and Bethnal     Green, London.
10136-8{_}18309{_}The process is mostly in the hands of German     workmen.
10136-8{_}18310{_}Sugar is adulterated with fine sand and sawdust.
10136-8{_}18311{_}Pure     sugar is highly nutritious, adding to the fatty tissue of the     body; but it is not easy of digestion.

10136-8{_}18315{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}18316{_}of flour, 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18317{_}of stoned raisins, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18318{_}of suet, a pinch of salt, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}18319{_}of sugar, a little grated nutmeg, milk.
10136-8{_}18320{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; stone the raisins and cut them in halves; mix these with the suet, add the salt, sugar, and grated nutmeg, and moisten the whole with sufficient milk to make it of the consistency of thick batter.
10136-8{_}18321{_}Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer.
10136-8{_}18322{_}Turn it out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over, and serve.
10136-8{_}18323{_}This is a very plain recipe, and suitable where there is a family of children.
10136-8{_}18324{_}It, of course, can be much improved by the addition of candied peel, currants, and rather a larger proportion of suet: a few eggs would also make the pudding richer.

10136-8{_}18329{_}INTRODUCTION OF SUGAR.--Sugar was first known as a drug, and     used by the apothecaries, and with them was a most important     article.
10136-8{_}18330{_}At its first appearance, some said it was heating;     others, that it injured the chest; others, that it disposed     persons to apoplexy; the truth, however, soon conquered these     fancies, and the use of sugar has increased every day, and there     is no household in the civilized world which can do without it.

10136-8{_}18378{_}[Illustration: RHUBARB.]
10136-8{_}18379{_}RHUBARB.--This is one of the most useful of all garden     productions that are put into pies and puddings.
10136-8{_}18380{_}It was     comparatively little known till within the last twenty or thirty     years, but it is now cultivated in almost every British garden.
10136-8{_}18381{_}The part used is the footstalks of the leaves, which, peeled and     cut into small pieces, are put into tarts, either mixed with     apples or alone.
10136-8{_}18382{_}When quite young, they are much better not     peeled.
10136-8{_}18383{_}Rhubarb comes in season when apples are going out.
10136-8{_}18384{_}The     common rhubarb is a native of Asia; the scarlet variety has the     finest flavour.
10136-8{_}18385{_}Turkey rhubarb, the well-known medicinal drug,     is the root of a very elegant plant (_Rheum palmatum_), coming     to greatest perfection in Tartary.
10136-8{_}18386{_}For culinary purposes, all     kinds of rhubarb are the better for being blanched.
10136-8{_}18387{_}RAISED PIE OF POULTRY OR GAME.
10136-8{_}18388{_}1340.
10136-8{_}18389{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}18390{_}of flour allow 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18391{_}of butter, 1/2 pint of water, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt (these are for the crust); 1 large fowl or pheasant, a few slices of veal cutlet, a few slices of dressed ham, forcemeat, seasoning of nutmeg, allspice, pepper and salt, gravy.
10136-8{_}18392{_}[Illustration: RAISED PIE.]
10136-8{_}18393{_}_Mode_.--Make a stiff short crust with the above proportion of butter, flour, water, and eggs, and work it up very smoothly; butter a raised-pie mould, as shown in No.
10136-8{_}18394{_}1190, and line it with the paste.
10136-8{_}18395{_}Previously to making the crust, bone the fowl, or whatever bird is intended to be used, lay it, breast downwards, upon a cloth, and season the inside well with pounded mace, allspice, pepper, and salt; then spread over it a layer of forcemeat, then a layer of seasoned veal, and then one of ham, and then another layer of forcemeat, and roll the fowl over, making the skin meet at the back.
10136-8{_}18396{_}Line the pie with forcemeat, put in the fowl, and fill up the cavities with slices of seasoned veal and ham and forcemeat; wet the edges of the pie, put on the cover, pinch the edges together with the paste-pincers, and decorate it with leaves; brush it over with beaten yolk of egg, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours.
10136-8{_}18397{_}In the mean time, make a good strong gravy from the bones, pour it through a funnel into the hole at the top; cover this hole with a small leaf, and the pie, when cold, will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}18398{_}Let it be remembered that the gravy must be considerably reduced before it is poured into the pie, as, when cold, it should form a firm jelly, and not be the least degree in a liquid state.
10136-8{_}18399{_}This recipe is suitable for all kinds of poultry or game, using one or more birds, according to the size of the pie intended to be made; but the birds must always be boned.
10136-8{_}18400{_}Truffles, mushrooms, &c., added to this pie, make it much nicer; and, to enrich it, lard the fleshy parts of the poultry or game with thin strips of bacon.
10136-8{_}18401{_}This method of forming raised pies in a mould is generally called a _timbale_, and has the advantage of being more easily made than one where the paste is raised by the hands; the crust, besides, being eatable.
10136-8{_}18402{_}(_See_ coloured plate N 1.)
10136-8{_}18403{_}_Time_.--Large pie, 4 hours.

10136-8{_}18409{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 lbs.

10136-8{_}18411{_}415, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}18412{_}of hot-water paste No.
10136-8{_}18413{_}1217, 1/2 pint of good strong gravy.
10136-8{_}18414{_}_Mode_.--To raise the crust for a pie with the hands is a very difficult task, and can only be accomplished by skilled and experienced cooks.
10136-8{_}18415{_}The process should be seen to be satisfactorily learnt, and plenty of practice given to the making of raised pies, as by that means only will success be insured.
10136-8{_}18416{_}Make a hot-water paste by recipe No.
10136-8{_}18417{_}1217, and from the mass raise the pie with the hands; if this cannot be accomplished, cut out pieces for the top and bottom, and a long piece for the sides; fasten the bottom and side-piece together by means of egg, and pinch the edges well together; then line the pie with forcemeat made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}18418{_}415, put in a layer of veal, and a plentiful seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice, as, let it be remembered, these pies taste very insipid unless highly seasoned.
10136-8{_}18419{_}Over the seasoning place a layer of sliced bacon or cooked ham, and then a layer of forcemeat, veal seasoning, and bacon, and so on until the meat rises to about an inch above the paste; taking care to finish with a layer of forcemeat, to fill all the cavities of the pie, and to lay in the meat firmly and compactly.
10136-8{_}18420{_}Brush the top edge of the pie with beaten egg, put on the cover, press the edges, and pinch them round with paste-pincers.
10136-8{_}18421{_}Make a hole in the middle of the lid, and ornament the pie with leaves, which should be stuck on with the white of an egg; then brush it all over with the beaten yolk of an egg, and bake the pie in an oven with a soaking heat from 3 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}18422{_}To ascertain when it is done, run a sharp-pointed knife or skewer through the hole at the top into the middle of the pie, and if the meat feels tender, it is sufficiently baked.
10136-8{_}18423{_}Have ready about 1/2 pint of very strong gravy, pour it through a funnel into the hole at the top, stop up the hole with a small leaf of baked paste, and put the pie away until wanted for use.
10136-8{_}18424{_}Should it acquire too much colour in the baking, cover it with white paper, as the crust should not in the least degree be burnt.
10136-8{_}18425{_}Mushrooms, truffles, and many other ingredients, may be added to enrich the flavour of these pies, and the very fleshy parts of the meat may be larded.
10136-8{_}18426{_}These pies are more frequently served cold than hot, and form excellent dishes for cold suppers or breakfasts.
10136-8{_}18427{_}The cover of the pie is sometimes carefully removed, leaving the perfect edges, and the top decorated with square pieces of very bright aspic jelly: this has an exceedingly pretty effect.

10136-8{_}18450{_}RICE, with proper management in cooking it, forms a very     valuable and cheap addition to our farinaceous food, and, in     years of scarcity, has been found eminently useful in lessening     the consumption of flour.

10136-8{_}18452{_}The water in which it is dressed should only     simmer, and not boil hard.
10136-8{_}18453{_}Very little water should be used, as     the grains absorb a great deal, and, consequently, swell much;     and if they take up too much at first, it is difficult to get     rid of it.

10136-8{_}18504{_}BOILED RICE FOR CURRIES, &c.  1347.
10136-8{_}18505{_}INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}18506{_}of rice, water, salt.
10136-8{_}18507{_}_Mode_.--Pick, wash, and soak the rice in plenty of cold water; then have ready a saucepan of boiling water, drop the rice into it, and keep it boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, until it is tender, but not soft.
10136-8{_}18508{_}Take it up, drain it, and put it on a dish before the fire to dry: do not handle it much with a spoon, but shake it about a little with two forks, that it may all be equally dried, and strew over a little salt.
10136-8{_}18509{_}It is now ready to serve, and may be heaped lightly on a dish by itself, or be laid round the dish as a border, with a curry or fricassee in the centre.
10136-8{_}18510{_}Some cooks smooth the rice with the back of a spoon, and then brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven to colour; but the rice well boiled, white, dry, and with every grain distinct, is by far the more preferable mode of dressing it.
10136-8{_}18511{_}During the process of boiling, the rice should be attentively watched, that it be not overdone, as, if this is the case, it will have a mashed and soft appearance.
10136-8{_}18512{_}_Time_.--15 to 25 minutes, according to the quality of the rice.
10136-8{_}18513{_}_Average cost_, 3d.
10136-8{_}18514{_}_Sufficient_ for a large dish of curry.
10136-8{_}18515{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}18516{_}RICE, in the native rough state, with the husk on, is called     _paddy_, both in India and America, and it will keep better, and     for a much longer time, in this state, than after the husk has     been removed; besides which, prepared rice is apt to become     dirty from rubbing about in the voyage on board ship, and in the     warehouses.
10136-8{_}18517{_}It is sometimes brought to England in the shape of     paddy, and the husk detached here.
10136-8{_}18518{_}Paddy pays less duty than     shelled rice.

10136-8{_}18545{_}Or Rice Border, for Ragouts, Fricassees, &c. (an Entree).
10136-8{_}18546{_}1350.
10136-8{_}18547{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}18548{_}of rice, 3 pints of weak stock or broth, 2 slices of fat ham, 1 teaspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}18549{_}[Illustration: CASSEROLE OF RICE.]
10136-8{_}18550{_}_Mode_.--A casserole of rice, when made in a mould, is not such a difficult operation as when it is moulded by the hand.
10136-8{_}18551{_}It is an elegant and inexpensive entrée, as the remains of cold fish, flesh, or fowl may be served as ragoûts, fricassees, &c., inclosed in the casserole.
10136-8{_}18552{_}It requires great nicety in its preparation, the principal thing to attend to being the boiling of the rice, as, if this is not sufficiently cooked, the casserole, when moulded, will have a rough appearance, which would entirely spoil it.
10136-8{_}18553{_}After having washed the rice in two or three waters, drain it well, and put it into a stewpan with the stock, ham, and salt; cover the pan closely, and let the rice gradually swell over a slow fire, occasionally stirring, to prevent its sticking.
10136-8{_}18554{_}When it is quite soft, strain it, pick out the pieces of ham, and, with the back of a large wooden spoon, mash the rice to a perfectly smooth paste.
10136-8{_}18555{_}Then well grease a mould (moulds are made purposely for rice borders), and turn it upside down for a minute or two, to drain away the fat, should there be too much; put some rice all round the bottom and sides of it; place a piece of soft bread in the middle, and cover it with rice; press it in equally with the spoon, and let it cool.
10136-8{_}18556{_}Then dip the mould into hot water, turn the casserole carefully on to a dish, mark where the lid is to be formed on the top, by making an incision with the point of a knife about an inch from the edge all round, and put it into a _very hot_ oven.
10136-8{_}18557{_}Brush it over with a little clarified butter, and bake about 1/2 hour, or rather longer; then carefully remove the lid, which will be formed by the incision having been made all round, and remove the bread, in small pieces, with the point of a penknife, being careful not to injure the casserole.
10136-8{_}18558{_}Fill the centre with the ragoût or fricassee, which should be made thick; put on the cover, glaze it, place it in the oven to set the glaze, and serve as hot as possible.
10136-8{_}18559{_}The casserole should not be emptied too much, as it is liable to crack from the weight of whatever is put in; and in baking it, let the oven be very hot, or the casserole will probably break.
10136-8{_}18560{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice.
10136-8{_}18561{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 moderate-sized casseroles.

10136-8{_}18569{_}Put the milk into a stewpan, with sufficient essence of bitter almonds to flavour it well; then add the rice, which should be washed, picked, and drained, and let it swell gradually in the milk over a slow fire.
10136-8{_}18570{_}When it is tender, stir in the sugar, butter, and yolks of eggs; butter a mould, press in the rice, and proceed in exactly the same manner as in recipe No.

10136-8{_}18584{_}Stir in the butter, salt, and sugar, and when properly sweetened, add the yolks of the eggs, and then the whites, both of which should be well beaten, and added separately to the rice.
10136-8{_}18585{_}Butter a mould, strew in some fine bread crumbs, and let them be spread equally over it; then carefully pour in the rice, and bake the pudding in a _slow_ oven for 1 hour.

10136-8{_}18596{_}_Mode_.--Put 1-1/2 pint of the milk into a stewpan, with any of the above flavourings, and bring it to the boiling-point, and, with the other 1/2 pint of milk, mix the ground rice to a smooth batter; strain the boiling milk to this, and stir over the fire until the mixture is tolerably thick; then pour it into a basin, leave it uncovered, and when nearly or quite cold, sweeten it to taste, and add the eggs, which should be previously well beaten, with a little salt.
10136-8{_}18597{_}Put the pudding into a well-buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil for 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}18598{_}For a baked pudding, proceed in precisely the same manner, only using half the above proportion of ground rice, with the same quantity of all the other ingredients: an hour will bake the pudding in a moderate oven.

10136-8{_}18609{_}_Mode_.--Put the rice into a stewpan, with the milk and sugar, and let these simmer over a gentle fire until the rice is sufficiently soft to break up into a smooth mass, and should the milk dry away too much, a little more may be added.
10136-8{_}18610{_}Stir the rice occasionally, to prevent its burning, then beat it to a smooth mixture; add the yolks of the eggs, which should be well whisked, and the vanilla (should this flavouring not be liked, essence of bitter almonds may be substituted for it); put this rice custard into the freezing-pot, and proceed as directed in recipe No.

10136-8{_}18734{_}Let the paste cool a little; then fill it with preserve, place a few stars or leaves on it, which have been previously cut out of the paste and baked, and the tart is ready for table.
10136-8{_}18735{_}By making it in this manner, both the flavour and colour of the jam are preserved, which would otherwise be lost, were it baked in the oven on the paste; and, besides, so much jam is not required.

10136-8{_}18740{_}STRAWBERRY.--The name of this favourite fruit is said to be derived from an ancient custom of putting straw beneath the fruit when it began to ripen, which is very useful to keep it moist and clean.
10136-8{_}18741{_}The strawberry belongs to temperate and rather cold climates; and no fruit of these latitudes, that ripens without the aid of artificial heat, is at all comparable with it in point of flavour.
10136-8{_}18742{_}The strawberry is widely diffused, being found in most parts of the world, particularly in Europe and America.

10136-8{_}18769{_}SAGO.--Sago is the pith of a species of palm (_Cycas     circinalis_).
10136-8{_}18770{_}Its form is that of a small round grain.
10136-8{_}18771{_}There are     two sorts of sago,--the white and the yellow; but their     properties are the same.
10136-8{_}18772{_}Sago absorbs the liquid in which it is     cooked, becomes transparent and soft, and retains its original     shape.
10136-8{_}18773{_}Its alimentary properties are the same as those of     tapioca and arrowroot.
10136-8{_}18774{_}SAGO SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.
10136-8{_}18775{_}1368.

10136-8{_}18816{_}It may be used in soup or broth, or mixed     with milk or water, and butter.
10136-8{_}18817{_}It is excellent food for either     the healthy or sick, for the reason that it is so quickly     digested without fatigue to the stomach.

10136-8{_}18839{_}of flour, a suet crust by recipe No.
10136-8{_}18840{_}1215; roll it out to the thickness of 1/2 inch, and spread the treacle equally over it, leaving a small margin where the paste joins; close the ends securely, tie the pudding in a floured cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil for 2 hours.
10136-8{_}18841{_}We have inserted this pudding, being economical, and a favourite one with children; it is, of course, only suitable for a nursery, or very plain family dinner.
10136-8{_}18842{_}Made with a lard instead of a suet crust, it would be very nice baked, and would be sufficiently done in from 1-1/2 to 2 hours.

10136-8{_}18856{_}Place some sausage-meat on one-half of each square, wet the edges of the paste, and fold it over the meat; slightly press the edges together, and trim them neatly with a knife.
10136-8{_}18857{_}Brush the rolls over with the yolk of an egg, and bake them in a well-heated oven for about 1/2 hour, or longer should they be very large.

10136-8{_}18868{_}_Mode_.--Carefully weigh the various ingredients, by placing on one side of the scales the eggs, and on the other the flour; then the sugar, and then the butter.
10136-8{_}18869{_}Warm the butter, and with the hands beat it to a cream; gradually dredge in the flour and pounded sugar, and keep stirring and beating the mixture without ceasing until it is perfectly smooth.
10136-8{_}18870{_}Then add the eggs, which should be well whisked, and either of the above flavourings that may be preferred; butter some small cups, rather more than half-fill them, and bake in a brisk oven for about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}18871{_}Turn them out, dish them on a napkin, and serve custard or wine-sauce with them.
10136-8{_}18872{_}A pretty little supper-dish may be made of these puddings cold, by cutting out a portion of the inside with the point of a knife, and putting into the cavity a little whipped cream or delicate preserve, such as apricot, greengage, or very bright marmalade.
10136-8{_}18873{_}The paste for these puddings requires a great deal of mixing, as the more it is beaten, the better will the puddings be.
10136-8{_}18874{_}When served cold, they are usually called _gâteaux à la Madeleine_.
10136-8{_}18875{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}18876{_}_Average cost_, 10d.

10136-8{_}18883{_}of finely-chopped suet, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/2 pint of milk or water.
10136-8{_}18884{_}_Mode_.--Chop the suet very finely, after freeing it from skin, and mix it well with the flour; add the salt and pepper (this latter ingredient may be omitted if the flavour is not liked), and make the whole into a smooth paste with the above proportion of milk or water.
10136-8{_}18885{_}Tie the pudding in a floured cloth, or put it into a buttered basin, and boil from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

10136-8{_}18890{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}18891{_}_Note_.--When there is a joint roasting or baking, this pudding may be boiled in a long shape, and then cut into slices a few minutes before dinner is served: these slices should be laid in the dripping-pan for a minute or two, and then browned before the fire.
10136-8{_}18892{_}Most children like this accompaniment to roast meat.
10136-8{_}18893{_}Where there is a large family of children, and the means of keeping them are limited, it is a most economical plan to serve up the pudding before the meat: as, in this case, the consumption of the latter article will be much smaller than it otherwise would be.

10136-8{_}18943{_}1208, taking care that it is very evenly rolled out each time, to insure its rising properly; and if the paste is not extremely light, and put into a good hot oven, this cannot be accomplished, and the _vol-au-vent_ will look very badly.
10136-8{_}18944{_}Roll out the paste to the thickness of about 1-1/2 inch, and, with a fluted cutter, stamp it out to the desired shape, either round or oval, and, with the point of a small knife, make a slight incision in the paste all round the top, about an inch from the edge, which, when baked, forms the lid.
10136-8{_}18945{_}Put the _vol-au-vent_ into a good brisk oven, and keep the door shut for a few minutes after it is put in.
10136-8{_}18946{_}Particular attention should he paid to the heating of the oven, for the paste _cannot_ rise without a tolerable degree of heat When of a nice colour, without being scorched, withdraw it from the oven, instantly remove the cover where it was marked, and detach all the soft crumb from the centre: in doing this, be careful not to break the edges of the _vol-au-vent_; but should they look thin in places, stop them with small flakes of the inside paste, stuck on with the white of an egg.
10136-8{_}18947{_}This precaution is necessary to prevent the fricassee or ragoût from bursting the case, and so spoiling the appearance of the dish.

10136-8{_}18985{_}STRAWBERRY.--Among the Greeks, the name of the strawberry     indicated its tenuity, this fruit forming hardly a mouthful.
10136-8{_}18986{_}With the Latins, the name reminded one of the delicious perfume     of this plant.
10136-8{_}18987{_}Both nations were equally fond of it, and applied     the same care to its cultivation.
10136-8{_}18988{_}Virgil appears to place it in     the same rank with flowers; and Ovid gives it a tender epithet,     which delicate palates would not disavow.
10136-8{_}18989{_}Neither does this     luxurious poet forget the wild strawberry, which disappears     beneath its modest foliage, but whose presence the scented air     reveals.

10136-8{_}19008{_}Serve the instant they are taken up, as they spoil directly, by falling and becoming heavy; and in eating them do not touch them with a knife, but tear them apart with two forks.
10136-8{_}19009{_}They may be eaten with meat gravy, or cold butter and sugar, and if not convenient to make the dough at home, a little from the baker's answers as well, only it must be placed for a few minutes near the fire, in a basin with a cloth over it, to let it rise again before it is made into dumplings.

10136-8{_}19013{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}19014{_}YEAST consists principally of a substance very similar in     composition, and in many of its sensible properties, to gluten;     and, when new or fresh, it is inflated and rendered frothy by a     large quantity of carbonic acid.
10136-8{_}19015{_}When mixed with wort, this     substance acts upon the saccharine matter; the temperature     rises, carbonic acid is disengaged, and the result is _ale_,     which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol, or     spirit.
10136-8{_}19016{_}The quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being     small, the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed:     hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor, and     gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is     remarkable.
10136-8{_}19017{_}The fermenting property of yeast is weakened by     boiling for ten minutes, and is entirely destroyed by continuing     the boiling.
10136-8{_}19018{_}Alcohol poured upon it likewise renders it inert;     on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed     during fermentation.
10136-8{_}19019{_}YORKSHIRE PUDDING, to serve with hot Roast Beef.

10136-8{_}19026{_}Put the pudding into the oven, and bake it for an hour; then, for another 1/2 hour, place it under the meat, to catch a little of the gravy that flows from it.
10136-8{_}19027{_}Cut the pudding into small square pieces, put them on a hot dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}19028{_}If the meat is baked, the pudding may at once be placed under it, resting the former on a small three-cornered stand.

10136-8{_}19034{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CREAMS, JELLIES, SOUFFLÉS, OMELETS, & SWEET DISHES.
10136-8{_}19035{_}1385.
10136-8{_}19036{_}CREAMS.--The yellowish-white, opaque fluid, smooth and unctuous to the touch, which separates itself from new milk, and forms a layer on its surface, when removed by skimming, is employed in a variety of culinary preparations.
10136-8{_}19037{_}The analyses of the contents of cream have been decided to be, in 100 parts--butter, 3.5; curd, or matter of cheese, 3.5; whey, 92.0.
10136-8{_}19038{_}That cream contains an oil, is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil; and when boiled for some time, a little oil floats upon the surface.
10136-8{_}19039{_}The thick animal oil which it contains, the well-known _butter_, is separated only by agitation, as in the common process of _churning_, and the cheesy matter remains blended with the whey in the state of _buttermilk_.
10136-8{_}19040{_}Of the several kinds of cream, the principal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams, the Costorphin cream, and the Scotch sour cream.
10136-8{_}19041{_}The Devonshire cream is produced by nearly boiling the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal fire, and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up.
10136-8{_}19042{_}It is used for eating with fruits and tarts.
10136-8{_}19043{_}The cream from Costorphin, a village of that name near Edinburgh, is accelerated in its separation from three or four days' old milk, by a certain degree of heat; and the Dutch clotted cream--a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand upright--is manufactured from fresh-drawn milk, which is put into a pan, and stirred with a spoon two or three times a day, to prevent the cream from separating from the milk.
10136-8{_}19044{_}The Scotch "sour cream" is a misnomer; for it is a material produced without cream.
10136-8{_}19045{_}A small tub filled with skimmed milk is put into a larger one, containing hot water, and after remaining there all night, the thin milk (called _wigg_) is drawn off, and the remainder of the contents of the smaller vessel is "sour cream."
10136-8{_}19046{_}1386.
10136-8{_}19047{_}JELLIES are not the nourishing food they were at one time considered to be, and many eminent physicians are of opinion that they are less digestible than the flesh, or muscular part of animals; still, when acidulated with lemon-juice and flavoured with wine, they are very suitable for some convalescents.
10136-8{_}19048{_}Vegetable jelly is a distinct principle, existing in fruits, which possesses the property of gelatinizing when boiled and cooled; but it is a principle entirely different from the gelatine of animal bodies, although the name of jelly, common to both, sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that subject.
10136-8{_}19049{_}Animal jelly, or gelatine, is glue, whereas vegetable jelly is rather analogous to gum.
10136-8{_}19050{_}Liebig places gelatine very low indeed in the scale of usefulness.
10136-8{_}19051{_}He says, "Gelatine, which by itself is tasteless, and when eaten, excites nausea, possesses no nutritive value; that, even when accompanied by the savoury constituents of flesh, it is not capable of supporting the vital process, and when added to the usual diet as a substitute for plastic matter, does not increase, but, on the contrary, diminishes the nutritive value of the food, which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality."
10136-8{_}19052{_}It is this substance which is most frequently employed in the manufacture of the jellies supplied by the confectioner; but those prepared at home from calves' feet do possess some nutrition, and are the only sort that should be given to invalids.
10136-8{_}19053{_}Isinglass is the purest variety of gelatine, and is prepared from the sounds or swimming-bladders of certain fish, chiefly the sturgeon.
10136-8{_}19054{_}From its whiteness it is mostly used for making blanc-mange and similar dishes.
10136-8{_}19055{_}1387.
10136-8{_}19056{_}THE WHITE OF EGGS is perhaps the best substance that can be employed in clarifying jelly, as well as some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen (and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen) is put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances suspended in it, on boiling the liquid, the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner, and, entangling with it the impurities, rises with them to the surface as a scum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight.
10136-8{_}19057{_}1388.
10136-8{_}19058{_}SOUFFLES, OMELETS, AND SWEET DISHES, in which eggs form the principal ingredient, demand, for their successful manufacture, an experienced cook.
10136-8{_}19059{_}They are the prettiest, but most difficult of all entremets.
10136-8{_}19060{_}The most essential thing to insure success is to secure the best ingredients from an honest tradesman.
10136-8{_}19061{_}The entremets coming within the above classification, are healthy, nourishing, and pleasant to the taste, and may be eaten with safety by persons of the most delicate stomachs.

10136-8{_}19081{_}of butter, a little apricot jam.
10136-8{_}19082{_}_Mode_.--Pare the apples, and take out the cores without dividing them; boil up the sugar and water for a few minutes; then lay in the apples, and simmer them very gently until tender, taking care not to let them break.
10136-8{_}19083{_}Have ready sufficient marmalade made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}19084{_}1395, and flavoured with lemon, to cover the bottom of the dish; arrange the apples on this with a piece of butter placed in each, and in between them a few spoonfuls of apricot jam or marmalade; place the dish in the oven for 10 minutes, then sprinkle over the top sifted sugar; either brown it before the fire or with a salamander, and serve hot.

10136-8{_}19090{_}FLANC OF APPLES, or APPLES IN A RAISED CRUST.
10136-8{_}19091{_}_(Sweet Entremets.

10136-8{_}19093{_}INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}19094{_}of short crust No.
10136-8{_}19095{_}1211 or 1212, 9 moderate-sized apples, the rind and juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}19096{_}of white sugar, 3/4 pint of water, a few strips of candied citron.
10136-8{_}19097{_}_Mode_.--Make a short crust by either of the above recipes; roll it out to the thickness of 1/2 inch, and butter an oval mould; line it with the crust, and press it carefully all round the sides, to obtain the form of the mould, but be particular not to break the paste.
10136-8{_}19098{_}Pinch the part that just rises above the mould with the paste-pincers, and fill the case with flour; bake it for about 3/4 hour; then take it out of the oven, remove the flour, put the case back in the oven for another 1/4 hour, and do not allow it to get scorched.
10136-8{_}19099{_}It is now ready for the apples, which should be prepared in the following manner: peel, and take out the cores with a small knife, or a cutter for the purpose, without dividing the apples; put them into a small lined saucepan, just capable of holding them, with sugar, water, lemon juice and rind, in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}19100{_}Let them simmer very gently until tender; then take out the apples, let them cool, arrange them in the flanc or case, and boil down the syrup until reduced to a thick jelly; pour it over the apples, and garnish them with a few slices of candied citron.

10136-8{_}19102{_}A MORE SIMPLE FLANC may be made by rolling out the paste, cutting the bottom of a round or oval shape, and then a narrow strip for the sides: these should be stuck on with the white of an egg, to the bottom piece, and the flanc then filled with raw fruit, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely.
10136-8{_}19103{_}It will not require so long baking as in a mould; but the crust must be made everywhere of an equal thickness, and so perfectly joined, that the juice does not escape.
10136-8{_}19104{_}This dish may also be served hot, and should be garnished in the same manner, or a little melted apricot jam may be poured over the apples, which very much improves their flavour.

10136-8{_}19114{_}of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk, apples, hot lard or clarified beef-dripping.
10136-8{_}19115{_}_Mode_.--Break the eggs; separate the whites from the yolks, and beat them separately.
10136-8{_}19116{_}Put the flour into a basin, stir in the butter, which should be melted to a cream; add the salt, and moisten with sufficient warm milk to make it of a proper consistency, that is to say, a batter that will drop from the spoon.
10136-8{_}19117{_}Stir this well, rub down any lumps that may be seen, and add the whites of the eggs, which have been previously well whisked; beat up the batter for a few minutes, and it is ready for use.
10136-8{_}19118{_}Now peel and cut the apples into rather thick whole slices, without dividing them, and stamp out the middle of each slice, where the core is, with a cutter.
10136-8{_}19119{_}Throw the slices into the batter; have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; take out the pieces of apple one by one, put them into the hot lard, and fry a nice brown, turning them--when required.
10136-8{_}19120{_}When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to absorb the greasy moisture; then dish on a white d'oyley, piled one above the other; strew over them some pounded sugar, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}19121{_}The flavour of the fritters would be very much improved by soaking the pieces of apple in a little wine, mixed with sugar and lemon-juice, for 3 or 4 hours before wanted for table; the batter, also, is better for being mixed some hours before the fritters are made.

10136-8{_}19130{_}_Mode_.--Peel and core a dozen of the apples without dividing them, and stew them very gently in a lined saucepan with 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}19131{_}of sugar and 1/2 pint of water, and when tender, lift them carefully on to a dish.
10136-8{_}19132{_}Have ready the remainder of the apples pared, cored, and cut into thin slices; put them into the same syrup with the lemon-peel, and boil gently until they are reduced to a marmalade: they must be kept stirred, to prevent them from burning.
10136-8{_}19133{_}Cover the bottom of a dish with some of the marmalade, and over that a layer of the stewed apples, in the insides of which, and between each, place some of the marmalade; then place another layer of apples, and fill up the cavities with marmalade as before, forming the whole into a raised oval shape.
10136-8{_}19134{_}Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, mix with them the pounded sugar, and cover the apples very smoothly all over with the icing; blanch and cut each almond into 4 or 5 strips; place these strips at equal distances over the icing sticking up; strew over a little rough pounded sugar, and place the dish in a very slow oven, to colour the almonds, and for the apples to get warm through.

10136-8{_}19151{_}The jelly is then done, and may be poured into moulds which have been previously dipped in water, when it will turn out nicely for dessert or a side-dish; for the latter a little custard should be poured round, and it should be garnished with strips of citron or stuck with blanched almonds.

10136-8{_}19162{_}When this jelly is nice and clear, and turned out well, it makes a pretty addition to the supper-table, with a little custard or whipped cream round it: the addition of a little lemon-juice improves the flavour, but it is apt to render the jelly muddy and thick.

10136-8{_}19341{_}1408.
10136-8{_}19342{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of new milk, 1-1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}19343{_}of isinglass, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}19344{_}of loaf sugar, 10 bitter almonds, 1/2 oz.

10136-8{_}19346{_}[Illustration: BLANC-MANGE MOULD.]
10136-8{_}19347{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the isinglass, lemon-rind, and sugar, and let these ingredients stand by the side of the fire until the milk is well flavoured; add the almonds, which should be blanched and pounded in a mortar to a paste, and let the milk just boil up; strain it through a fine sieve or muslin into a jug, add the cream, and stir the mixture occasionally until nearly cold.
10136-8{_}19348{_}Let it stand for a few minutes, then pour it into the mould, which should be previously oiled with the purest salad-oil, or dipped in cold water.
10136-8{_}19349{_}There will be a sediment at the bottom of the jug, which must not be poured into the mould, as, when turned out, it would very much disfigure the appearance of the blanc-mange.
10136-8{_}19350{_}This blanc-mange may be made very much richer by using 1-1/2 pint of cream, and melting the isinglass in 1/2 pint of boiling water.
10136-8{_}19351{_}The flavour may also be very much varied by adding bay-leaves, laurel-leaves, or essence of vanilla, instead of the lemon-rind and almonds.
10136-8{_}19352{_}Noyeau, Maraschino, Curaçoa, or any favourite liqueur, added in small proportions, very much enhances the flavour of this always favourite dish.

10136-8{_}19385{_}TO MAKE THE STOCK FOR JELLY, AND TO CLARIFY IT.
10136-8{_}19386{_}1411.
10136-8{_}19387{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 calf's feet, 6 pints of water.
10136-8{_}19388{_}[Illustration: JELLY-MOULD.]
10136-8{_}19389{_}[Illustration: JELLY-BAG.]
10136-8{_}19390{_}_Mode_.--The stock for jellies should always be made the day before it is required for use, as the liquor has time to cool, and the fat can be so much more easily and effectually removed when thoroughly set.
10136-8{_}19391{_}Procure from the butcher's 2 nice calf's feet: scald them, to take off the hair; slit them in two, remove the fat from between the claws, and wash the feet well in warm water; put them into a stewpan, with the above proportion of cold water, bring it gradually to boil, and remove every particle of scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}19392{_}When it is well skimmed, boil it very gently for 6 or 7 hours, or until the liquor is reduced rather more than half; then strain it through a sieve into a basin, and put it in a cool place to set.
10136-8{_}19393{_}As the liquor is strained, measure it, to ascertain the proportion for the jelly, allowing something for the sediment and fat at the top.
10136-8{_}19394{_}To clarify it, carefully remove all the fat from the top, pour over a little warm water, to wash away any that may remain, and wipe the jelly with a clean cloth; remove the jelly from the sediment, put it into a saucepan, and, supposing the quantity to be a quart, add to it 6 oz.
10136-8{_}19395{_}of loaf sugar, the shells and well-whisked whites of 5 eggs, and stir these ingredients together cold; set the saucepan on the fire, but _do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm_.
10136-8{_}19396{_}Let it boil about 10 minutes after it rises to a head, then throw in a teacupful of cold water; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then take the saucepan off, cover it closely, and let it remain 1/2 hour near the fire.
10136-8{_}19397{_}Dip the jelly-bag into hot water, wring it out quite dry, and fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair, which must be placed near the fire, to prevent the jelly from setting before it has run through the bag.
10136-8{_}19398{_}Place a basin underneath to receive the jelly; then pour it into the bag, and should it not be clear the first time, run it through the bag again.
10136-8{_}19399{_}This stock is the foundation of all _really good_ jellies, which may be varied in innumerable ways, by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs, and by moulding it with fresh and preserved fruits.
10136-8{_}19400{_}To insure the jelly being firm when turned out, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}19401{_}of isinglass clarified might be added to the above proportion of stock.
10136-8{_}19402{_}Substitutes for calf's feet are now frequently used in making jellies, which lessen the expense and trouble in preparing this favourite dish; isinglass and gelatine being two of the principal materials employed; but, although they may _look_ as nicely as jellies made from good stock, they are never so delicate, having very often an unpleasant flavour, somewhat resembling glue, particularly when made with gelatine.
10136-8{_}19403{_}_Time_.--About 6 hours to boil the feet for the stock; to clarify it,--1/4 hour to boil, 1/2 hour to stand in the saucepan covered.
10136-8{_}19404{_}_Average cost_.--Calf's feet may be purchased for 6d.
10136-8{_}19405{_}each when veal is in full season, but more expensive when it is scarce.
10136-8{_}19406{_}_Sufficient_.--2 calf's feet should make 1 quart of stock.
10136-8{_}19407{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October, but may be had all the year.
10136-8{_}19408{_}HOW TO MAKE A JELLY-BAG.--The very stout flannel called     double-mill, used for ironing-blankets, is the best material for     a jelly-bag: those of home manufacture are the only ones to be     relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly.
10136-8{_}19409{_}Care should be     taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice, to secure it     against unequal filtration.
10136-8{_}19410{_}The most convenient mode of using     the big is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside     of its mouth; and, to do this, strings should be sewn round it     at equal distances.
10136-8{_}19411{_}The jelly-bag may, of coarse, be made any     size; but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep, and seven or     eight across the mouth, will be sufficient for ordinary use.
10136-8{_}19412{_}The     form of a jelly-bag is the fool's cap.
10136-8{_}19413{_}COW-HEEL STOCK FOR JELLIES.
10136-8{_}19414{_}(More Economical than Calf's Feet.)
10136-8{_}19415{_}1412.
10136-8{_}19416{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 cow-heels, 3 quarts of water.
10136-8{_}19417{_}_Mode_.--Procure 2 heels that have only been scalded, and not boiled; split them in two, and remove the fat between the claws; wash them well in warm water, and put them into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water; bring it gradually to boil, remove all the scum as it rises, and simmer the heels gently from 7 to 8 hours, or until the liquor is reduced one-half; then strain it into a basin, measuring the quantity, and put it in a cool place.
10136-8{_}19418{_}Clarify it in the same manner as calf's-feet stock No.
10136-8{_}19419{_}1411, using, with the other ingredients, about 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}19420{_}of isinglass to each quart.
10136-8{_}19421{_}This stock should be made the day before it is required for use.
10136-8{_}19422{_}Two dozen shank-bones of mutton, boiled for 6 or 7 hours, yield a quart of strong firm stock.
10136-8{_}19423{_}They should be put on in 2 quarts of water, which should be reduced one-half.
10136-8{_}19424{_}Make this also the day before it is required.
10136-8{_}19425{_}_Time_.--7 to 8 hours to boil the cow-heels, 6 to 7 hours to boil the shank-bones.
10136-8{_}19426{_}_Average cost_, from 4d.
10136-8{_}19427{_}to 6d.
10136-8{_}19428{_}each.
10136-8{_}19429{_}_Sufficient_.--2 cow-heels should make 3 pints of stock.
10136-8{_}19430{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}19431{_}ISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY.
10136-8{_}19432{_}(_Substitutes for Calf's Feet_.)
10136-8{_}19433{_}1413.
10136-8{_}19434{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 oz.
10136-8{_}19435{_}of isinglass or gelatine, 2 quarts of water.
10136-8{_}19436{_}_Mode_.--Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water; bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil very fast, until the liquor is reduced one-half.
10136-8{_}19437{_}Carefully remove the scum as it rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag, and it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}19438{_}If not required very clear, it may be merely strained through a fine sieve, instead of being run through a bag.
10136-8{_}19439{_}Rather more than 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}19440{_}of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong calf's-feet stock, and rather more than 2 oz.
10136-8{_}19441{_}for the same quantity of fruit juice.
10136-8{_}19442{_}As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength, it is difficult to give the exact proportions.
10136-8{_}19443{_}The larger the mould, the stiffer should be the jelly; and where there is no ice, more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen.
10136-8{_}19444{_}This forms a stock for all kinds of jellies, which may be flavoured in many ways.
10136-8{_}19445{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}19446{_}_Sufficient_, with wine, syrup, fruit, &c., to fill two moderate-sized moulds.
10136-8{_}19447{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}19448{_}_Note_.--The above, when boiled, should be perfectly clear, and may be mixed warm with wine, flavourings, fruits, &c., and then run through the bag.
10136-8{_}19449{_}ISINGLASS.--The best isinglass is brought from Russia; some of     an inferior kind is brought from North and South America and the     East Indies: the several varieties may be had from the wholesale     dealers in isinglass in London.
10136-8{_}19450{_}In choosing isinglass for     domestic use, select that which is whitest, has no unpleasant     odour, and which dissolves most readily in water.
10136-8{_}19451{_}The inferior     kinds are used for fining beer, and similar purposes.
10136-8{_}19452{_}Isinglass     is much adulterated: to test its purity, take a few threads of     the substance, drop some into boiling water, some into cold     water, and some into vinegar.
10136-8{_}19453{_}In the boiling water the isinglass     will dissolve, in cold water it will become white and "cloudy,"     and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly-like.
10136-8{_}19454{_}If the     isinglass is adulterated with gelatine (that is to say, the     commoner sorts of gelatine,--for isinglass is classed amongst     gelatines, of all which varieties it is the very purest and     best), in boiling water the gelatine will not so completely     dissolve as the isinglass; in cold water it becomes clear and     jelly-like; and in vinegar it will harden.
10136-8{_}19455{_}HOW TO MOULD BOTTLED JELLIES.
10136-8{_}19456{_}1414.
10136-8{_}19457{_}Uncork the bottle; place it in a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to a liquid state; taste it, to ascertain whether it is sufficiently flavoured, and if not, add a little wine.
10136-8{_}19458{_}Pour the jelly into moulds which have been soaked in water; let it set, and turn it out by placing the mould in hot water for a minute; then wipe the outside, put a dish on the top, and turn it over quickly.
10136-8{_}19459{_}The jelly should then slip easily away from the mould, and be quite firm.
10136-8{_}19460{_}It may be garnished as taste dictates.
10136-8{_}19461{_}TO CLARIFY SYRUP FOR JELLIES.
10136-8{_}19462{_}1415.
10136-8{_}19463{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of water allow 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}19464{_}of loaf sugar; the white of 1 egg.
10136-8{_}19465{_}_Mode_.--Put the sugar and water into a stewpan; set it on the fire, and, when the sugar is dissolved, add the white of the egg, whipped up with a little water.
10136-8{_}19466{_}Whisk the whole well together, and simmer very gently until it has thrown up all the scum.
10136-8{_}19467{_}Take this off as it rises, strain the syrup through a fine sieve or cloth into a basin, and keep it for use.
10136-8{_}19468{_}CALF'S-FEET JELLY.
10136-8{_}19469{_}1416.
10136-8{_}19470{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of calf's-feet stock No.
10136-8{_}19471{_}1411, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}19472{_}of sugar, 1/2 pint of sherry, 1 glass of brandy, the shells and whites of 5 eggs, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}19473{_}of isinglass.
10136-8{_}19474{_}_Mode_.--Prepare the stock as directed in recipe No.
10136-8{_}19475{_}1411, taking care to leave the sediment, and to remove all the fat from the surface.
10136-8{_}19476{_}Put it into a saucepan, cold, without clarifying it; add the remaining ingredients, and stir them well together before the saucepan is placed on the fire.
10136-8{_}19477{_}Then simmer the mixture gently for 1/4 hour, _but do not stir it after it begins to warm_.
10136-8{_}19478{_}Throw in a teacupful of cold water, boil for another 5 minutes, and keep the saucepan covered by the side of the fire for about 1/2 hour, but do not let it boil again.
10136-8{_}19479{_}In simmering, the head or scum may be carefully removed as it rises; but particular attention must be given to the jelly, that it be not stirred in the slightest degree after it is heated.
10136-8{_}19480{_}The isinglass should be added when the jelly begins to boil: this assists to clear it, and makes it firmer for turning out.
10136-8{_}19481{_}Wring out a jelly-bag in hot water; fasten it on to a stand, or the back of a chair; place it near the fire with a basin underneath it, and run the jelly through it.
10136-8{_}19482{_}Should it not be perfectly clear the first time, repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is obtained.
10136-8{_}19483{_}Soak the moulds in water, drain them for half a second, pour in the jelly, and put it in a cool place to set.
10136-8{_}19484{_}If ice is at hand, surround the moulds with it, and the jelly will set sooner, and be firmer when turned out.
10136-8{_}19485{_}In summer it is necessary to have ice in which to put the moulds, or the cook will be, very likely, disappointed, by her jellies being in too liquid a state to turn out properly, unless a great deal of isinglass is used.
10136-8{_}19486{_}When wanted for table, dip the moulds in hot water for a minute, wipe the outside with a cloth, lay a dish on the top of the mould, turn it quickly over, and the jelly should slip out easily.
10136-8{_}19487{_}It is sometimes served broken into square lumps, and piled high in glasses.
10136-8{_}19488{_}Earthenware moulds are preferable to those of pewter or tin, for red jellies, the colour and transparency of the composition being often spoiled by using the latter.
10136-8{_}19489{_}[Illustration: JELLY-MOULD.]
10136-8{_}19490{_}To make this jelly more economically, raisin wine may be substituted for the sherry and brandy, and the stock made from cow-heels, instead of calf's feet.
10136-8{_}19491{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to simmer the jelly, 1/2 hour to stand covered.

10136-8{_}19497{_}_Note_.--As lemon-juice, unless carefully strained, is liable to make the jelly muddy, see that it is clear before it is added to the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}19498{_}Omit the brandy when the flavour is objected to.
10136-8{_}19499{_}SHERRY.--There are several kinds of sherry, as pale and brown, and there are various degrees of each.
10136-8{_}19500{_}Sherry is, in general, of an amber-colour, and, when good, has a fine aromatic odour, with something of the agreeable bitterness of the peach kernel.
10136-8{_}19501{_}When new, it is harsh and fiery, and requires to be mellowed in the wood for four or five years.
10136-8{_}19502{_}Sherry has of late got much into fashion in England, from the idea that it is more free from acid than other wines; but some careful experiments on wines do not fully confirm this opinion.

10136-8{_}19540{_}_Mode_.--Make a cake with the flour, butter, sugar, and baking-powder; moisten with the egg and sufficient milk to make it the proper consistency, and bake it in a round tin.
10136-8{_}19541{_}When cold, scoop out the middle, leaving a good thickness all round the sides, to prevent them breaking; take some of the scooped-out pieces, which should be trimmed into neat slices; lay them in the cake, and pour over sufficient raisin-wine, with the addition of a little brandy, if approved, to soak them well.

10136-8{_}19562{_}of isinglass.
10136-8{_}19563{_}_Mode_.--Procure about 18 Savoy biscuits, or ladies'-fingers, as they are sometimes called; brush the edges of them with the white of an egg, and line the bottom of a plain round mould, placing them like a star or rosette.
10136-8{_}19564{_}Stand them upright all round the edge; carefully put them so closely together that the white of the egg connects them firmly, and place this case in the oven for about 5 minutes, just to dry the egg.
10136-8{_}19565{_}Whisk the cream to a stiff froth, with the sugar, flavouring, and melted isinglass; fill the charlotte with it, cover with a slice of sponge-cake cut in the shape of the mould; place it in ice, where let it remain till ready for table; then turn it on a dish, remove the mould, and serve.
10136-8{_}19566{_}1 tablespoonful of liqueur of any kind, or 4 tablespoonfuls of wine, would nicely flavour the above proportion of cream.
10136-8{_}19567{_}For arranging the biscuits in the mould, cut them to the shape required, so that they fit in nicely, and level them with the mould at the top, that, when turned out, there may be something firm to rest upon.
10136-8{_}19568{_}Great care and attention is required in the turning out of this dish, that the cream does not burst the case; and the edges of the biscuits must have the smallest quantity of egg brushed over them, or it would stick to the mould, and so prevent the charlotte from coming away properly.

10136-8{_}19590{_}[Illustration: CUSTARDS IN GLASSES.]
10136-8{_}19591{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk into a lined saucepan, with the sugar, and whichever of the above flavourings may be preferred (the lemon-rind flavours custards most deliciously), and let the milk steep by the side of the fire until it is well flavoured.
10136-8{_}19592{_}Bring it to the point of boiling, then strain it into a basin; whisk the eggs well, and, when the milk has cooled a little, stir in the eggs, and _strain_ this mixture into a jug.
10136-8{_}19593{_}Place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire; keep stirring the custard _one way_ until it thickens; but on no account allow it to reach the boiling-point, as it will instantly curdle and be full of lumps.
10136-8{_}19594{_}Take it off the fire, stir in the brandy, and, when this is well mixed with the custard, pour it into glasses, which should be rather more than three-parts full; grate a little nutmeg over the top, and the dish is ready for table.
10136-8{_}19595{_}To make custards look and eat better, ducks' eggs should be used, when obtainable; they add very much to the flavour and richness, and so many are not required as of the ordinary eggs, 4 ducks' eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard.
10136-8{_}19596{_}When desired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for the milk, and double the quantity of eggs used, to those mentioned, omitting the whites.
10136-8{_}19597{_}_Time_.

10136-8{_}19620{_}of flour, 1/2 pint of new milk.
10136-8{_}19621{_}_Mode_.--Beat the eggs thoroughly, and put them into a basin with the butter, which should be beaten to a cream; stir in the sugar and flour, and when these ingredients are well mixed, add the milk; keep stirring and beating the mixture for a few minutes; put it on buttered plates, and bake in a quick oven for 20 minutes.

10136-8{_}19631{_}_Mode_.--Put the water, isinglass, and lemon-rind into a lined saucepan, and simmer gently until the isinglass is dissolved; strain this into a basin, stir in the eggs, which should be well beaten, the lemon-juice, which should be strained, and the wine; sweeten to taste with pounded sugar, mix all well together, pour it into a jug, set this jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and keep stirring it one way until it thickens; but _take care that it does not boil_.
10136-8{_}19632{_}Strain it into a mould that has been oiled or laid in water for a short time, and put it in a cool place to set.
10136-8{_}19633{_}A tablespoonful of brandy stirred in just before it is poured into the mould, improves the flavour of this dish: it is better if made the day before it is required for table.
10136-8{_}19634{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to simmer the isinglass; about 1/4 hour to stir the mixture over the fire.
10136-8{_}19635{_}_Average cost_, 4s.

10136-8{_}19639{_}PALE SHERRIES are made from the same grapes as brown.
10136-8{_}19640{_}The latter     are coloured by an addition of some cheap must, or wine which     has been boiled till it has acquired a deep-brown tint.
10136-8{_}19641{_}Pale     sherries were, some time ago, preferred in England, being     supposed most pure; but the brown are preferred by many people.
10136-8{_}19642{_}The inferior sherries exported to England are often mixed with a     cheap and light wine called Moguer, and are strengthened in the     making by brandy; but too frequently they are adulterated by the     London dealers.

10136-8{_}19648{_}Then well whisk the whites of the eggs in the other basin, until they are stiff, and, when firm, mix lightly with the yolks, till the whole forms a smooth and light substance; butter a round cake-tin, put in the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven from 15 to 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}19649{_}Pin a white napkin round the tin, strew sifted sugar over the top of the soufflé, and send it immediately to table.
10136-8{_}19650{_}The proper appearance of this dish depends entirely on the expedition with which it is served, and some cooks, to preserve its lightness, hold a salamander over the soufflé until it is placed on the table.
10136-8{_}19651{_}If allowed to stand after it comes from the oven, it will be entirely spoiled, as it falls almost immediately.

10136-8{_}19727{_}PRESERVED GINGER comes to us from the West Indies.
10136-8{_}19728{_}It is made by     scalding the roots when they are green and full of sap, then     peeling them in cold water, and putting them into jars, with a     rich syrup; in which state we receive them.
10136-8{_}19729{_}It should be chosen     of a bright-yellow colour, with a little transparency: what is     dark-coloured, fibrous, and stringy, is not good.
10136-8{_}19730{_}Ginger roots,     fit for preserving, and in size equal to West Indian, have been     produced in the Royal Agricultural Garden in Edinburgh.

10136-8{_}19782{_}[Illustration: THE CITRON.]
10136-8{_}19783{_}THE CITRON.--The citron belongs to the same species as the     lemon, being considered only as a variety, the distinction     between them not being very great.
10136-8{_}19784{_}It is larger, and is less     succulent, but more acid: with a little artificial heat, the     citron comes to as great perfection in England as in Spain and     Italy.
10136-8{_}19785{_}The fruit is oblong and about five or six inches in     length.
10136-8{_}19786{_}The tree is thorny.
10136-8{_}19787{_}The juice forms an excellent     lemonade with sugar and water; its uses in punch, negus, and in     medicine, are well known.
10136-8{_}19788{_}The rind is very thick, and, when     candied with sugar, forms an excellent sweetmeat.
10136-8{_}19789{_}There are     several varieties cultivated in England, one of which is termed     the Forbidden Fruit.
10136-8{_}19790{_}ITALIAN CREAM.

10136-8{_}19794{_}_Mode_.--Put the cream and milk into a saucepan, with sugar to sweeten, and the lemon-rind.
10136-8{_}19795{_}Boil until the milk is well flavoured then strain it into a basin, and add the beaten yolks of eggs.
10136-8{_}19796{_}Put this mixture into a jug; place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and stir the contents until they thicken, but do not allow them to boil.
10136-8{_}19797{_}Take the cream off the fire, stir in the lemon-juice and isinglass, which should be melted, and whip well; fill a mould, place it in ice if at hand, and, when set, turn it out on a dish, and garnish as taste may dictate.
10136-8{_}19798{_}The mixture may be whipped and drained, and then put into small glasses, when this mode of serving is preferred.

10136-8{_}19808{_}_Mode_.--Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately; then mix them and beat well again, adding a few thin slices of citron, the cream, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten it nicely.
10136-8{_}19809{_}When the mixture is well beaten, put it into a buttered pan, and fry the same as a pancake; but it should be three times the thickness of an ordinary pancake.

10136-8{_}19830{_}1440.
10136-8{_}19831{_}INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1-1/2 pint of jelly, a few nice strawberries, or red or white currants, or raspberries, or any fresh fruit that may be in season.
10136-8{_}19832{_}_Mode_.--Have ready the above proportion of jelly, which must be very clear and rather sweet, the raw fruit requiring an additional quantity of sugar.
10136-8{_}19833{_}Select ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick off the stalks, unless currants are used, when they are laid in the jelly as they come from the tree.
10136-8{_}19834{_}Begin by putting a little jelly at the bottom of the mould, which must harden; then arrange the fruit round the sides of the mould, recollecting; that _it will be reversed when turned out;_ then pour in some more jelly to make the fruit adhere, and, when that layer is set, put another row of fruit and jelly until the mould is full.
10136-8{_}19835{_}If convenient, put it in ice until required for table, then wring a cloth in boiling water, wrap it round the mould for a minute, and turn the jelly carefully out.
10136-8{_}19836{_}Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, &c., are better for being boiled in a little clear syrup before they are laid in the jelly; strawberries, raspberries, grapes, cherries, and currants are put in raw.
10136-8{_}19837{_}In winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable, a very pretty jelly may be made with preserved fruits or brandy cherries: these, in a bright and clear jelly, have a very pretty effect; of course, unless the jelly be _very clear_, the beauty of the dish will be spoiled.
10136-8{_}19838{_}It may be garnished with the same fruit as is laid in the jelly; for instance, an open jelly with strawberries might have, piled in the centre, a few of the same fruit prettily arranged, or a little whipped cream might be substituted for the fruit.
10136-8{_}19839{_}[Illustration: JELLY MOULDED WITH CHERRIES.]
10136-8{_}19840{_}_Time_.--One layer of jelly should remain 2 hours in a very cool place, before another layer is added.

10136-8{_}19842{_}6d.

10136-8{_}19845{_}JELLY OF TWO COLOURS.
10136-8{_}19846{_}1441.
10136-8{_}19847{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of calf's-feet jelly No.
10136-8{_}19848{_}1416, a few drops of prepared cochineal.
10136-8{_}19849{_}[Illustration: JELLY OF TWO COLOURS.]
10136-8{_}19850{_}_Mode_.--Make 1-1/2 pint of jelly by recipe No.
10136-8{_}19851{_}1416, or, if wished more economical, of clarified syrup and gelatine, flavouring it in any way that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}19852{_}Colour one-half of the jelly with a few drops of prepared cochineal, and the other half leave as pale as possible.
10136-8{_}19853{_}Have ready a mould well wetted in every part; pour in a small quantity of the red jelly, and let this set; when quite firm, pour on it the same quantity of the pale jelly, and let this set; then proceed in this manner until the mould is full, always taking care to let one jelly set before the other is poured in, or the colours would run one into the other.
10136-8{_}19854{_}When turned out, the jelly should have a striped appearance.
10136-8{_}19855{_}For variety, half the mould may be filled at once with one of the jellies, and, when firm, filled up with the other: this, also, has a very pretty effect, and is more expeditiously prepared than when the jelly is poured in small quantities into the mould.
10136-8{_}19856{_}Blancmange and red jelly, or blancmange and raspberry cream, moulded in the above manner, look very well.
10136-8{_}19857{_}The layers of blancmange and jelly should be about an inch in depth, and each layer should be perfectly hardened before another is added.
10136-8{_}19858{_}Half a mould of blancmange and half a mould of jelly are frequently served in the same manner.
10136-8{_}19859{_}A few pretty dishes may be made, in this way, of jellies or blancmanges left from the preceding day, by melting them separately in a jug placed in a saucepan of boiling water, and then moulding them by the foregoing directions.
10136-8{_}19860{_}(See coloured plate S1.)

10136-8{_}19865{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}19866{_}_Note_.--In making the jelly, use for flavouring a very pale sherry, or the colour will be too dark to contrast nicely with the red jelly.

10136-8{_}19877{_}Put the gelatine with the rest of the milk into a saucepan, and let it stand by the side of the fire to dissolve; boil for a minute or two, stir carefully into the basin, adding 3 oz.
10136-8{_}19878{_}more of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}19879{_}When cold, stir in the lemon-juice, which should be carefully strained, and pour the mixture into a well-oiled mould, leaving out the lemon-peel, and set the mould in a pan of cold water until wanted for table.
10136-8{_}19880{_}Use eggs that have rich-looking yolks; and, should the weather be very warm, rather a larger proportion of gelatine must be allowed.

10136-8{_}19945{_}Previously to adding the lemon-juice to the other ingredients, ascertain that it is very nicely strained, as, if this is not properly attended to, it is liable to make the jelly thick and muddy.
10136-8{_}19946{_}As this jelly is very pale, and almost colourless, it answers very well for moulding with a jelly of any bright hue; for instance, half a jelly bright red, and the other half made of the above, would have a very good effect.

10136-8{_}19959{_}Boil the whole from 10 to 15 minutes; strain it again, and let it stand till it is cold and begins to stiffen.

10136-8{_}19970{_}of isinglass, 1-1/2 pint of water, the juice of 2 lemons, 1/4 pint of liqueur.
10136-8{_}19971{_}[Illustration: OVAL JELLY-MOULD.]
10136-8{_}19972{_}_Mode_.--Put the sugar, with 1 pint of the water, into a stewpan, and boil them gently by the side of the fire until there is no scum remaining, which must be carefully removed as fast as it rises.
10136-8{_}19973{_}Boil the isinglass with the other 1/2 pint of water, and skim it carefully in the same manner.
10136-8{_}19974{_}Strain the lemon-juice, and add it, with the clarified isinglass, to the syrup; put in the liqueur, and bring the whole to the boiling-point.
10136-8{_}19975{_}Let the saucepan remain covered by the side of the fire for a few minutes; then pour the jelly through a bag, put it into a mould, and set the mould in ice until required for table.

10136-8{_}19988{_}1423.
10136-8{_}19989{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel and sugar; bring it to the boiling-point, drop in the macaroni, and let it gradually swell over a gentle fire, but do not allow the pipes to break.
10136-8{_}19990{_}The form should be entirely preserved; and, though tender, should be firm, and not soft, with no part beginning to melt.
10136-8{_}19991{_}Should the milk dry away before the macaroni is sufficiently swelled, add a little more.
10136-8{_}19992{_}Make a custard by recipe No.
10136-8{_}19993{_}1423; place the macaroni on a dish, and pour the custard over the hot macaroni; grate over it a little nutmeg, and, when cold, garnish the dish with slices of candied citron.

10136-8{_}19998{_}MERINGUES.
10136-8{_}19999{_}1451.
10136-8{_}20000{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}20001{_}of pounded sugar, the whites of 4 eggs.
10136-8{_}20002{_}[Illustration: MERINGUES.]
10136-8{_}20003{_}_Mode_.--Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and, with a wooden spoon, stir in _quickly_ the pounded sugar; and have some boards thick enough to put in the oven to prevent the bottom of the meringues from acquiring too much colour.
10136-8{_}20004{_}Cut some strips of paper about 2 inches wide; place this paper on the board, and drop a tablespoonful at a time of the mixture on the paper, taking care to let all the meringues be the same size.
10136-8{_}20005{_}In dropping it from the spoon, give the mixture the form of an egg, and keep the meringues about 2 inches apart from each other on the paper.
10136-8{_}20006{_}Strew over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}20007{_}As soon as they begin to colour, remove them from the oven; take each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it gently on the table, and, with a small spoon, take out the soft part of each meringue.
10136-8{_}20008{_}Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues upside down, and put them into the oven to harden and brown on the other side.
10136-8{_}20009{_}When required for table, fill them with whipped cream, flavoured with liqueur or vanilla, and sweetened with pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}20010{_}Join two of the meringues together, and pile them high in the dish, as shown in the annexed drawing.
10136-8{_}20011{_}To vary their appearance, finely-chopped almonds or currants may be strewn over them before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may be garnished with any bright-coloured preserve.
10136-8{_}20012{_}Great expedition is necessary in making this sweet dish; as, if the meringues are not put into the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are mixed, the former melts, and the mixture would run on the paper, instead of keeping its egg-shape.
10136-8{_}20013{_}The sweeter the meringues are made, the crisper will they be; but, if there is not sufficient sugar mixed with them, they will most likely be tough.
10136-8{_}20014{_}They are sometimes coloured with cochineal; and, if kept well covered in a dry place, will remain good for a month or six weeks.
10136-8{_}20015{_}_Time_.--Altogether, about 1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}20016{_}_Average cost_, with the cream and flavouring, 1s.

10136-8{_}20023{_}_Mode_.--Dissolve the isinglass in a little boiling water, add the lemon-juice, and strain this to the cream, putting in sufficient noyeau and sugar to flavour and sweeten the mixture nicely; whisk the cream well, put it into an oiled mould, and set the mould in ice or in a cool place; turn it out, and garnish the dish to taste.
10136-8{_}20024{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}20033{_}[Illustration: OPEN JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.]
10136-8{_}20034{_}_Mode_.--Make the above proportion of calf's-feet or isinglass jelly, colouring and flavouring it in any way that may be preferred; soak a mould, open in the centre, for about 1/2 hour in cold water; fill it with the jelly, and let it remain in a cool place until perfectly set; then turn it out on a dish; fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with sherry and sweetened with pounded sugar; pile this cream high in the centre, and serve.
10136-8{_}20035{_}The jelly should be made of rather a dark colour, to contrast nicely with the cream.
10136-8{_}20036{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour.

10136-8{_}20046{_}[Illustration: OPEN MOULD.]
10136-8{_}20047{_}_Mode_.--Put the water into a saucepan, with the isinglass, sugar, and the rind of 1 orange, and the same of 1/2 lemon, and stir these over the fire until the isinglass is dissolved, and remove the scum; then add to this the juice of the Seville orange, the juice of the lemon, and sufficient juice of China oranges to make in all 1 pint; from 8 to 10 oranges will yield the desired quantity.
10136-8{_}20048{_}Stir all together over the fire until it is just on the point of boiling; skim well; then strain the jelly through a very fine sieve or jelly-bag, and when nearly cold, put it into a mould previously wetted, and, when quite set, turn it out on a dish, and garnish it to taste.
10136-8{_}20049{_}To insure this jelly being clear, the orange-and lemon-juice should be well strained, and the isinglass clarified, before they are added to the other ingredients, and, to heighten the colour, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added.
10136-8{_}20050{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to boil without the juice; 1 minute after it is added.
10136-8{_}20051{_}_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s.

10136-8{_}20058{_}1454, 4 oranges, 1 pint of clarified syrup.

10136-8{_}20060{_}of loaf sugar with 1/2 pint of water until there is no scum left (which must be carefully removed as fast as it rises), and carefully peel the oranges; divide them into thin slices, without breaking the thin skin, and put these pieces of orange into the syrup, where let them remain for about 5 minutes; then take them out, and use the syrup for the jelly, which should be made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}20061{_}1454.
10136-8{_}20062{_}When the oranges are well drained, and the jelly is nearly cold, pour a little of the latter into the bottom of the mould; then lay in a few pieces of orange; over these pour a little jelly, and when this is set, place another layer of oranges, proceeding in this manner until the mould is full.
10136-8{_}20063{_}Put it in ice, or in a cool place, and, before turning it out, wrap a cloth round the mould for a minute or two, which has been wrung out in boiling water.

10136-8{_}20069{_}TO MAKE A PLAIN OMELET.
10136-8{_}20070{_}1456.
10136-8{_}20071{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1/3 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}20072{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}20073{_}[Illustration: OMELET.]
10136-8{_}20074{_}_Mode_.--Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat them up with the salt and pepper until extremely light; then add 2 oz.
10136-8{_}20075{_}of the butter broken into small pieces, and stir this into the mixture.
10136-8{_}20076{_}Put the other 2 oz.
10136-8{_}20077{_}of butter into a frying-pan, make it quite hot, and, as soon as it begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, &c. very briskly for a minute or two, and pour them into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon one way until the mixture thickens and becomes firm, and when the whole is set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form; and when it is nicely brown on one side, and quite firm, it is done.
10136-8{_}20078{_}To take off the rawness on the upper side, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel.
10136-8{_}20079{_}Serve very expeditiously on a very hot dish, and never cook it until it is just wanted.
10136-8{_}20080{_}The flavour of this omelet may be very much enhanced by adding minced parsley, minced onion or eschalot, or grated cheese, allowing 1 tablespoonful of the former, and half the quantity of the latter, to the above proportion of eggs.
10136-8{_}20081{_}Shrimps or oysters may also be added: the latter should be scalded in their liquor, and then bearded and cut into small pieces.
10136-8{_}20082{_}In making an omelet, be particularly careful that it is not too thin, and, to avoid this, do not make it in too large a frying-pan, as the mixture would then spread too much, and taste of the outside.
10136-8{_}20083{_}It should also not be greasy, burnt, or too much done, and should be cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole of the substance may be heated without drying up the outside.
10136-8{_}20084{_}Omelets are sometimes served with gravy; but _this should never be poured over them_, but served in a tureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and flat, instead of eating light and soft.
10136-8{_}20085{_}In making the gravy, the flavour should not overpower that of the omelet, and should be thickened with arrowroot or rice flour.
10136-8{_}20086{_}_Time_.--With 6 eggs, in a frying-pan 18 or 20 inches round, 4 to 6 minutes.
10136-8{_}20087{_}_Average cost_, 9d.
10136-8{_}20088{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.

10136-8{_}20091{_}1457.
10136-8{_}20092{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz.
10136-8{_}20093{_}of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced ham.
10136-8{_}20094{_}_Mode_.--Mince the ham very finely, without any fat, and fry it for 2 minutes in a little butter; then make the batter for the omelet, stir in the ham, and proceed as directed in recipe No.
10136-8{_}20095{_}1456.
10136-8{_}20096{_}Do not add any salt to the batter, as the ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart a flavour to the omelet.
10136-8{_}20097{_}Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers equally well for this dish; but they must also be slightly cooked previously to mixing them with the batter.
10136-8{_}20098{_}Serve very hot and quickly, without gravy.

10136-8{_}20112{_}When the eggs are set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form, and be careful that it is not too much done: to brown the top, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, or use a salamander until the desired colour is obtained, but never turn an omelet in the pan.
10136-8{_}20113{_}Slip it carefully on to a _very hot_ dish, or, what is a much safer method, put a dish on the omelet, and turn the pan quickly over.

10136-8{_}20201{_}SEVILLE ORANGE (_Citrus vulgaris_).--This variety, called also     _bitter orange_, is of the same species as the sweet orange, and     grows in great abundance on the banks of the Guadalquiver, in     Andalusia, whence this fruit is chiefly obtained.
10136-8{_}20202{_}In that part     of Spain there are very extensive orchards of these oranges,     which form the chief wealth of the monasteries.
10136-8{_}20203{_}The pulp of the     bitter orange is not eaten raw.
10136-8{_}20204{_}In the yellow rind, separated     from the white spongy substance immediately below it, is     contained an essential oil, which is an agreeable warm aromatic,     much superior for many purposes to that of the common orange.
10136-8{_}20205{_}The best marmalade and the richest wine are made from this     orange; and from its flowers the best orange-flower water is     distilled.
10136-8{_}20206{_}Seville oranges are also preserved whole as a     sweetmeat.
10136-8{_}20207{_}ORANGE FRITTERS.
10136-8{_}20208{_}1465.
10136-8{_}20209{_}INGREDIENTS.--For the batter, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}20210{_}of flour, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}20211{_}of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk, oranges, hot lard or clarified dripping.
10136-8{_}20212{_}_Mode_.--Make a nice light batter with the above proportion of flour, butter, salt, eggs, and sufficient milk to make it the proper consistency; peel the oranges, remove as much of the white skin as possible, and divide each orange into eight pieces, without breaking the thin skin, unless it be to remove the pips; dip each piece of orange in the batter.
10136-8{_}20213{_}Have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; drop in the oranges, and fry them a delicate brown from 8 to 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}20214{_}When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to drain away the greasy moisture, and dish them on a white d'oyley; sprinkle over them plenty of pounded sugar, and serve quickly.

10136-8{_}20219{_}A PRETTY DISH OF ORANGES.
10136-8{_}20220{_}1466.
10136-8{_}20221{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 large oranges, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}20222{_}of loaf sugar, 1/4 pint of water, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of any kind of liqueur, sugar to taste.
10136-8{_}20223{_}_Mode_.--Put the sugar and water into a saucepan, and boil them until the sugar becomes brittle, which may be ascertained by taking up a small quantity in a spoon, and dipping it in cold water; if the sugar is sufficiently boiled, it will easily snap.
10136-8{_}20224{_}Peel the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as possible, and divide them into nice-sized slices, without breaking the thin white skin which surrounds the juicy pulp.
10136-8{_}20225{_}Place the pieces of orange on small skewers, dip them into the hot sugar, and arrange them in layers round a plain mould, which should be well oiled with the purest salad-oil.
10136-8{_}20226{_}The sides of the mould only should be lined with the oranges, and the centre left open for the cream.
10136-8{_}20227{_}Let the sugar become firm by cooling; turn the oranges carefully out on a dish, and fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with any kind of liqueur, and sweetened with pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}20228{_}This is an exceedingly ornamental and nice dish for the supper-table.

10136-8{_}20234{_}TO MAKE PANCAKES.
10136-8{_}20235{_}1467.
10136-8{_}20236{_}INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, flour, milk; to every egg allow 1 oz.
10136-8{_}20237{_}of flour, about 1 gill of milk, 1/8 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}20238{_}[Illustration: PANCAKES.]
10136-8{_}20239{_}_Mode_.--Ascertain that the eggs are fresh; break each one separately in a cup; whisk them well, put them into a basin, with the flour, salt, and a few drops of milk, and beat the whole to a perfectly _smooth_ batter; then add by degrees the remainder of the milk.
10136-8{_}20240{_}The proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the eggs, &c. &c.; but the batter, when ready for frying, should be of the consistency of thick cream.
10136-8{_}20241{_}Place a small frying-pan on the fire to get hot; let it be delicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and, when quite hot, put into it a small piece of butter, allowing about 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}20242{_}to each pancake.
10136-8{_}20243{_}When it is melted, pour in the batter, about 1/2 teacupful to a pan 5 inches in diameter, and fry it for about 4 minutes, or until it is nicely brown on one side.
10136-8{_}20244{_}By only pouring in a small quantity of batter, and so making the pancakes thin, the necessity of turning them (an operation rather difficult to unskilful cooks) is obviated.
10136-8{_}20245{_}When the pancake is done, sprinkle over it some pounded sugar, roll it up in the pan, and take it out with a large slice, and place it on a dish before the fire.
10136-8{_}20246{_}Proceed in this manner until sufficient are cooked for a dish; then send them quickly to table, and continue to send in a further quantity, as pancakes are never good unless eaten almost immediately they come from the frying-pan.
10136-8{_}20247{_}The batter may be flavoured with a little grated lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have preserve rolled in them instead of sugar.
10136-8{_}20248{_}Send sifted sugar and a cut lemon to table with them.
10136-8{_}20249{_}To render the pancakes very light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately, and the whites added the last thing to the batter before frying.
10136-8{_}20250{_}_Time_.--from 4 to 6 minutes for a pancake that does not require turning; from 6 to 8 minutes for a thicker one.
10136-8{_}20251{_}_Average cost_, for 3 persons, 6d.
10136-8{_}20252{_}_Sufficient._--Allow 3 eggs, with the other ingredients in proportion, for 3 persons.

10136-8{_}20257{_}of loaf sugar, 1 glass of sherry, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, flour.
10136-8{_}20258{_}_Mode_.--Ascertain that the eggs are extremely fresh, beat them well, strain and mix with them the cream, pounded sugar, wine, nutmeg, and as much flour as will make the batter nearly as thick as that for ordinary pancakes.
10136-8{_}20259{_}Make the frying-pan hot, wipe it with a clean cloth, pour in sufficient batter to make a thin pancake, and fry it for about 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}20260{_}Dish the pancakes piled one above the other, strew sifted sugar between each, and serve.

10136-8{_}20273{_}1393, and skin, halve, and stone the peaches, which should be quite ripe; dip them in the batter, and fry the pieces in hot lard or clarified dripping, which should be brought to the boiling-point before the peaches are put in.
10136-8{_}20274{_}From 8 to 10 minutes will be required to fry them, and, when done, drain them before the fire, and dish them on a white d'oyley.

10136-8{_}20280{_}[Illustration: PEACH.]
10136-8{_}20281{_}PEACH.--The peach and nectarine are amongst the most delicious     of our fruits, and are considered as varieties of the same     species produced by cultivation.
10136-8{_}20282{_}The former is characterized by     a very delicate down, while the latter is smooth; but, as a     proof of their identity as to species, trees have borne peaches     in one part and nectarines in another; and even a single fruit     has had down on one side and the other smooth.
10136-8{_}20283{_}The trees are     almost exactly alike, as well as the blossoms.
10136-8{_}20284{_}Pliny states that     the peach was originally brought from Persia, where it grows     naturally, from which the name of Persica was bestowed upon it     by the Romans; and some modern botanists apply this as the     generic name, separating them from _Amygdalus_, or Almond, to     which Linnaeus had united them.
10136-8{_}20285{_}Although they are not tropical,     they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfection:     hence they seldom ripen in this country, in ordinary seasons,     without the use of walls or glass; consequently, they bear a     high price.
10136-8{_}20286{_}In a good peach, the flesh is firm, the skin thin,     of a deep bright colour next the sun and of a yellowish green     next to the wall; the pulp is yellowish, full of     highly-flavoured juice, the fleshy part thick, and the stone     small.
10136-8{_}20287{_}Too much down is a sign of inferior quality.
10136-8{_}20288{_}This fruit     is much used at the dessert, and makes a delicious preserve.

10136-8{_}20293{_}of gelatine.
10136-8{_}20294{_}_Mode_.--Peel and cut the pears into any form that may be preferred, and steep them in cold water to prevent them turning black; put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover them, and boil them with the butter and enough sugar to sweeten them nicely, until tender; then brush the pears over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle them with sifted sugar, and arrange them on a dish.
10136-8{_}20295{_}Add the gelatine to the syrup, boil it up quickly for about 5 minutes, strain it over the pears, and let it remain until set.
10136-8{_}20296{_}The syrup may be coloured with a little prepared cochineal, which would very much improve the appearance of the dish.

10136-8{_}20319{_}_Mode_.--This elegant dish, although it may appear extravagant, is really not so if made when pineapples are plentiful.
10136-8{_}20320{_}We receive them now in such large quantities from the West Indies, that at times they may be purchased at an exceedingly low rate: it would not, of course, be economical to use the pines which are grown in our English pineries for the purposes of fritters.
10136-8{_}20321{_}Pare the pine with as little waste as possible, cut it into rather thin slices, and soak these slices in the above proportion of brandy or liqueur and pounded sugar for 4 hours; then make a batter the same as for apple fritters, substituting cream for the milk, and using a smaller quantity of flour; and, when this is ready, dip in the pieces of pine, and fry them in boiling lard from 5 to 8 minutes; turn them when sufficiently brown on one side, and, when done, drain them from the lard before the fire, dish them on a white d'oyley, strew over them sifted sugar, and serve quickly.

10136-8{_}20328{_}PINEAPPLE.--The pineapple has not been known in Europe above two     hundred years, and has not been cultivated in England much above     a century.
10136-8{_}20329{_}It is stated that the first pineapples raised in     Europe were by M. La Cour, of Leyden, about the middle of the     17th century; and it is said to have been first cultivated in     England by Sir Matthew Decker, of Richmond.
10136-8{_}20330{_}In Kensington     Palace, there is a picture in which Charles II.
10136-8{_}20331{_}is represented     as receiving a pineapple from his gardener Rose, who is     presenting it on his knees.

10136-8{_}20348{_}_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes, and beat them up lightly with a fork, but do not use a spoon, as that would make them heavy.
10136-8{_}20349{_}Beat the eggs well, leaving out one of the whites; add the other ingredients, and beat all together for at least 20 minutes, or until the batter is extremely light.
10136-8{_}20350{_}Put plenty of good lard into a frying-pan, and drop a tablespoonful of the batter at a time into it, and fry the fritters a nice brown.
10136-8{_}20351{_}Serve them with the following sauce:--A glass of sherry mixed with the strained juice of a lemon, and sufficient white sugar to sweeten the whole nicely.

10136-8{_}20362{_}[Illustration: RASPBERRY CREAM MOULD.]
10136-8{_}20363{_}_Mode_.--Boil the milk, cream, and isinglass together for 1/4 hour, or until the latter is melted, and strain it through a hair sieve into a basin.
10136-8{_}20364{_}Let it cool a little; then add to it sufficient raspberry jelly, which, when melted, would make 1/3 pint, and stir well till the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.
10136-8{_}20365{_}If not sufficiently sweet, add a little pounded sugar with the brandy; whisk the mixture well until nearly cold, put it into a well-oiled mould, and set it in a cool place till perfectly set.
10136-8{_}20366{_}Raspberry jam may be substituted for the jelly, but must be melted, and rubbed through a sieve, to free it from seeds: in summer, the juice of the fresh fruit may be used, by slightly mashing it with a wooden spoon, and sprinkling sugar over it; the juice that flows from the fruit should then be used for mixing with the cream.
10136-8{_}20367{_}If the colour should not be very good, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added to improve its appearance.
10136-8{_}20368{_}(_See_ coloured plate T1.)

10136-8{_}20381{_}_Mode_.--Mix the rice to a smooth batter with about 1/2 pint of the milk, and the remainder put into a saucepan, with the sugar, butter, and whichever of the above flavourings may be preferred; bring the milk to the boiling-point, quickly stir in the rice, and let it boil for about 10 minutes, or until it comes easily away from the saucepan, keeping it well stirred the whole time.
10136-8{_}20382{_}Grease a mould with pure salad-oil; pour in the rice, and let it get perfectly set, when it should turn out quite easily; garnish it with jam, or pour round a compôte of any kind of fruit, just before it is sent to table.
10136-8{_}20383{_}This blancmange is better for being made the day before it is wanted, as it then has time to become firm.
10136-8{_}20384{_}If laurel-leaves are used for flavouring, steep 3 of them in the milk, and take them out before the rice is added: about 8 drops of essence of almonds, or from 12 to 16 drops of essence of vanilla, would be required to flavour the above proportion of milk.
10136-8{_}20385{_}_Time_.--From 10 to 15 minutes to boil the rice.

10136-8{_}20395{_}Let the rice get cold; then form it into small round balls, dip them into yolk of egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry them in boiling lard for about 10 minutes, turning them about, that they may get equally browned.
10136-8{_}20396{_}Drain the greasy moisture from them, by placing them on a cloth in front of the fire for a minute or two; pile them on a white d'oyley, and send them quickly to table.
10136-8{_}20397{_}A small piece of jam is sometimes introduced into the middle of each croquette, which adds very much to the flavour of this favourite dish.
10136-8{_}20398{_}_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to swell the rice; about 10 minutes to fry the croquettes.

10136-8{_}20408{_}of orange marmalade, 4 eggs.
10136-8{_}20409{_}_Mode_.--Swell the rice in the milk, with the sugar and butter, over a slow fire until it is perfectly tender, which will be in about 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}20410{_}When the rice is done, strain away the milk, should there be any left, and mix with it the marmalade and well-beaten eggs; stir the whole over the fire until the eggs are set; then spread the mixture on a dish to the thickness of about 1/2 inch, or rather thicker.
10136-8{_}20411{_}When it is perfectly cold, cut it into long strips, dip them in a batter the same as for apple fritters, and fry them a nice brown.

10136-8{_}20423{_}1423.
10136-8{_}20424{_}_Mode_.--Boil the rice in the milk, with sugar and a flavouring of essence of almonds, until the former is tender, adding, if necessary, a little more milk, should it dry away too much.
10136-8{_}20425{_}When the rice is quite soft, put it into teacups, or _small_ round jars, and let it remain until cold; then turn the rice out on a deep glass dish, pour over a custard made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}20426{_}1423, and, on the top of each ball place a small piece of bright-coloured preserve or jelly.
10136-8{_}20427{_}Lemon-peel or vanilla may be boiled with the rice instead of the essence of almonds, when either of these is preferred; but the flavouring of the custard must correspond with that of the rice.
10136-8{_}20428{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice in the milk.
10136-8{_}20429{_}_Average cost_, with the custard, 1s.

10136-8{_}20435{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of ground rice, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, pounded sugar to taste, flavouring of lemon-rind, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, or anything that may be preferred, a piece of butter the size of a walnut.
10136-8{_}20436{_}_Mode_.--Mix the ground rice with 6 tablespoonfuls of the milk quite smoothly, and put it into a saucepan with the remainder of the milk and butter, and keep stirring it over the fire for about 1/4 hour, or until the mixture thickens.
10136-8{_}20437{_}Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, beat the former in a basin, and stir to them the rice and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the soufflé; but add this latter ingredient as sparingly as possible, as, the less sugar there is used, the lighter will be the soufflé.
10136-8{_}20438{_}Now whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth or snow; mix them with the other preparation, and pour the whole into a soufflé-dish, and put it instantly into the oven; bake it about 1/2 hour in a moderate oven; take it out, hold a salamander or hot shovel over the top, sprinkle sifted sugar over it, and send the soufflé to table in the dish it was baked in, either with a napkin pinned round, or inclosed in a more ornamental dish.
10136-8{_}20439{_}The excellence of this fashionable dish entirely depends on the proper whisking of the whites of the eggs, the manner of baking, and the expedition with which it is sent to table.
10136-8{_}20440{_}Soufflés should be served _instantly_ from the oven, or they will sink, and be nothing more than an ordinary pudding.
10136-8{_}20441{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.

10136-8{_}20447{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 heaped tablespoonfuls of potato-flour, rice-flour, arrowroot, or tapioca, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, sifted sugar to taste, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt flavouring.
10136-8{_}20448{_}_Mode_.--Mix the potato-flour, or whichever one of the above ingredients is used, with a little of the milk; put it into a saucepan, with the remainder of the milk, the butter, salt, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely.
10136-8{_}20449{_}Stir these ingredients over the fire until the mixture thickens; then take it off the fire, and let it cool a little.
10136-8{_}20450{_}Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat the latter, and stir them into the soufflé batter.
10136-8{_}20451{_}Now whisk the whites of the eggs to the firmest possible froth, for on this depends the excellence of the dish; stir them to the other ingredients, and add a few drops of essence of any flavouring that may be preferred; such as vanilla, lemon, orange, ginger, &c. &c. Pour the batter into a soufflé-dish, put it immediately into the oven, and bake for about 1/2 hour; then take it out, put the dish into another more ornamental one, such as is made for the purpose; hold a salamander or hot shovel over the soufflé, strew it with sifted sugar, and send it instantly to table.
10136-8{_}20452{_}The secret of making a soufflé well, is to have the eggs well whisked, but particularly the whites, the oven not too hot, and to send it to table the moment it comes from the oven.
10136-8{_}20453{_}If the soufflé be ever so well made, and it is allowed to stand before being sent to table, its appearance and goodness will be entirely spoiled.
10136-8{_}20454{_}Soufflés may be flavoured in various ways, but must be named accordingly.
10136-8{_}20455{_}Vanilla is one of the most delicate and recherché flavourings that can be used for this very fashionable dish.

10136-8{_}20466{_}Then place them on a glass dish, beat up the yolks of the eggs, stir to them the milk, add a little more sugar, and strain this mixture into a jug; place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water, and stir it one way until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}20467{_}Pour this custard over the eggs, when they should rise to the surface.
10136-8{_}20468{_}They make an exceedingly pretty addition to a supper, and should be put in a cold place after being made.

10136-8{_}20470{_}A few drops of the essence of either may be poured in the milk just before the whites are poached.
10136-8{_}20471{_}In making the custard, a little more flavouring and sugar should always be added.

10136-8{_}20503{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}20504{_}of macaroons or 6 small sponge-cakes, sherry, 1 pint of cream, 5 oz.
10136-8{_}20505{_}of lump sugar, 2 large tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, the rind of 1 lemon, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 tablespoonfuls of milk.
10136-8{_}20506{_}_Mode_.--Lay the macaroons or sponge-cakes in a glass dish, and pour over them as much sherry as will cover them, or sufficient to soak them well.
10136-8{_}20507{_}Put the cream into a lined saucepan, with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let it remain by the side of the fire until the cream is well flavoured, when take out the lemon-rind.
10136-8{_}20508{_}Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cold milk; add this to the cream, and let it boil gently for about 3 minutes, keeping it well stirred.
10136-8{_}20509{_}Take it off the fire, stir till nearly cold, when add the lemon-juice, and pour the whole over the cakes.
10136-8{_}20510{_}Garnish the cream with strips of angelica, or candied citron cut thin, or bright-coloured jelly or preserve.
10136-8{_}20511{_}This cream is exceedingly delicious, flavoured with vanilla instead of lemon: when this flavouring is used, the sherry may be omitted, and the mixture poured over the _dry_ cakes.
10136-8{_}20512{_}_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to infuse the lemon-rind; 5 minutes to boil the cream.
10136-8{_}20513{_}_Average cost_, with cream at 1s.

10136-8{_}20517{_}TO MAKE SYLLABUB.
10136-8{_}20518{_}1486.
10136-8{_}20519{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of sherry or white wine, 1/2 grated nutmeg, sugar to taste, 1-1/2 pint of milk.
10136-8{_}20520{_}_Mode_.--Put the wine into a bowl, with the grated nutmeg and plenty of pounded sugar, and milk into it the above proportion of milk frothed up.
10136-8{_}20521{_}Clouted cream may be laid on the top, with pounded cinnamon or nutmeg and sugar; and a little brandy may be added to the wine before the milk is put in.
10136-8{_}20522{_}In some counties, cider is substituted for the wine: when this is used, brandy must always be added.
10136-8{_}20523{_}Warm milk may be poured on from a spouted jug or teapot; but it must be held very high.
10136-8{_}20524{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}20525{_}_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.
10136-8{_}20526{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}20527{_}TIPSY CAKE.
10136-8{_}20528{_}1487.
10136-8{_}20529{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 moulded sponge-or Savoy-cake, sufficient sweet wine or sherry to soak it, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}20530{_}of sweet almonds, 1 pint of rich custard.
10136-8{_}20531{_}[Illustration: TIPSY CAKE.]
10136-8{_}20532{_}_Mode_.--Procure a cake that is three or four days old,--either sponge, Savoy, or rice answering for the purpose of a tipsy cake.
10136-8{_}20533{_}Cut the bottom of the cake level, to make it stand firm in the dish; make a small hole in the centre, and pour in and over the cake sufficient sweet wine or sherry, mixed with the above proportion of brandy, to soak it nicely.
10136-8{_}20534{_}When the cake is well soaked, blanch and cut the almonds into strips, stick them all over the cake, and pour round it a good custard, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}20535{_}1423, allowing 8 eggs instead of 5 to the pint of milk.
10136-8{_}20536{_}The cakes are sometimes crumbled and soaked, and a whipped cream heaped over them, the same as for trifles.
10136-8{_}20537{_}_Time_.--About 2 hours to soak the cake.
10136-8{_}20538{_}_Average cost_, 4s.

10136-8{_}20542{_}ALMOND.--The almond-tree is a native of warmer climates than     Britain, and is indigenous to the northern parts of Africa and     Asia; but it is now commonly cultivated in Italy, Spain, and the     south of France.
10136-8{_}20543{_}It is not usually grown in Britain, and the     fruit seldom ripens in this country: it is much admired for the     beauty of its blossoms.
10136-8{_}20544{_}In the form of its leaves and blossoms     it strongly resembles the peach-tree, and is included in the     same genus by botanists; but the fruit, instead of presenting a     delicious pulp like the peach, shrivels up as it ripens, and     becomes only a tough coriaceous covering to the stone inclosing     the eatable kernel, which is surrounded by a thin bitter skin.
10136-8{_}20545{_}It flowers early in the spring, and produces fruit in August.
10136-8{_}20546{_}There are two sorts of almonds,--sweet and bitter; but they are     considered to be only varieties of the species; and though the     qualities of the kernels are very different, they are not     distinguishable by their appearance.
10136-8{_}20547{_}AN EASY WAY OF MAKING A TIPSY CAKE.
10136-8{_}20548{_}1488.
10136-8{_}20549{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 stale small sponge-cakes, raisin wine, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}20550{_}of jam, 1 pint of custard No.
10136-8{_}20551{_}1423.
10136-8{_}20552{_}_Mode_.--Soak the sponge-cakes, which should be stale (on this account they should be cheaper), in a little raisin wine; arrange them on a deep glass dish in four layers, putting a layer of jam between each, and pour round them a pint of custard, made by recipe No.
10136-8{_}20553{_}1423, decorating the top with cut preserved fruit.
10136-8{_}20554{_}_Time_.--2 hours to soak the cakes.

10136-8{_}20559{_}TO MAKE A TRIFLE.
10136-8{_}20560{_}1489.
10136-8{_}20561{_}INGREDIENTS.--For the whip, 1 pint of cream, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}20562{_}of pounded sugar, the whites of 2 eggs, a small glass of sherry or raisin wine.
10136-8{_}20563{_}For the trifle, 1 pint of custard, made with 8 eggs to a pint of milk; 6 small sponge-cakes, or 6 slices of sponge-cake; 12 macaroons, 2 dozen ratafias, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}20564{_}of sweet almonds, the grated rind of 1 lemon, a layer of raspberry or strawberry jam, 1/2 pint of sherry or sweet wine, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy.
10136-8{_}20565{_}[Illustration: TRIFLE.]
10136-8{_}20566{_}_Mode_.--The whip to lay over the top of the trifle should be made the day before it is required for table, as the flavour is better, and it is much more solid than when prepared the same day.
10136-8{_}20567{_}Put into a large bowl the pounded sugar, the whites of the eggs, which should be beaten to a stiff froth, a glass of sherry or sweet wine, and the cream.
10136-8{_}20568{_}Whisk these ingredients well in a cool place, and take off the froth with a skimmer as fast as it rises, and put it on a sieve to drain; continue the whisking till there is sufficient of the whip, which must be put away in a cool place to drain.
10136-8{_}20569{_}The next day, place the sponge-cakes, macaroons, and ratafias at the bottom of a trifle-dish; pour over them 1/2 pint of sherry or sweet wine, mixed with 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, and, should this proportion of wine not be found quite sufficient, add a little more, as the cakes should be well soaked.
10136-8{_}20570{_}Over the cakes put the grated lemon-rind, the sweet almonds, blanched and cut into strips, and a layer of raspberry or strawberry jam.
10136-8{_}20571{_}Make a good custard by recipe No.
10136-8{_}20572{_}1423, using 8 instead of 5 eggs to the pint of milk, and let this cool a little; then pour it over the cakes, &c. The whip being made the day previously, and the trifle prepared, there remains nothing to do now but heap the whip lightly over the top: this should stand as high as possible, and it may be garnished with strips of bright currant jelly, crystallized sweetmeats, or flowers; the small coloured comfits are sometimes used for the purpose of garnishing a trifle, but they are now considered rather old-fashioned.

10136-8{_}20582{_}of sugar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}20583{_}of isinglass, flavouring to taste of essence of vanilla.
10136-8{_}20584{_}[Illustration: VANILLA-CREAM MOULD.]
10136-8{_}20585{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk and sugar into a saucepan, and let it get hot over a slow fire; beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add gradually the sweetened milk; flavour the whole with essence of vanilla, put the mixture into a jug, and place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water.
10136-8{_}20586{_}Stir the contents with a wooden spoon one way until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will be full of lumps.
10136-8{_}20587{_}Take it off the fire; stir in the isinglass, which should be previously dissolved in about 1/4 pint of water, and boiled for 2 or 3 minutes; pour the cream into an oiled mould, put it in a cool place to set, and turn it out carefully on a dish.
10136-8{_}20588{_}Instead of using the essence of vanilla, a pod may be boiled in the milk instead, until the flavour is well extracted.
10136-8{_}20589{_}A pod, or a pod and a half, will be found sufficient for the above proportion of ingredients.
10136-8{_}20590{_}_Time_.--About 10 minutes to stir the mixture.

10136-8{_}20595{_}VANILLE or VANILLA, is the fruit of the vanillier, a parasitical     herbaceous plant, which flourishes in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru.
10136-8{_}20596{_}The fruit is a long capsule, thick and fleshy.
10136-8{_}20597{_}Certain species     of this fruit contain a pulp with a delicious perfume and     flavour.
10136-8{_}20598{_}Vanilla is principally imported from Mexico.
10136-8{_}20599{_}The     capsules for export are always picked at perfect maturity.
10136-8{_}20600{_}The     essence is the form in which it is used generally and most     conveniently.
10136-8{_}20601{_}Its properties are stimulating and exciting.
10136-8{_}20602{_}It is     in daily use for ices, chocolates, and flavouring confections     generally.

10136-8{_}20604{_}1491.
10136-8{_}20605{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs; their weight in pounded sugar, butter, and flour; 1/4 saltspoonful of salt, a layer of any kind of jam or marmalade.
10136-8{_}20606{_}_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour and pounded sugar; stir these ingredients well together, and add the eggs, which should be previously thoroughly whisked.
10136-8{_}20607{_}When the mixture has been well beaten for about 10 minutes, butter a Yorkshire-pudding tin, pour in the batter, and bake it in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}20608{_}Let it cool, spread one half of the cake with a layer of nice preserve, place over it the other half of the cake, press the pieces slightly together, and then cut it into long finger-pieces; pile them in crossbars on a glass dish, and serve.
10136-8{_}20609{_}_Time_.--20 minutes.

10136-8{_}20615{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of cream allow 3 oz.
10136-8{_}20616{_}of pounded sugar, 1 glass of sherry or any kind of sweet white wine, the rind of 1/2 lemon, the white of 1 egg.
10136-8{_}20617{_}[Illustration: PASTRY LEAF.]
10136-8{_}20618{_}_Mode_.--Rub the sugar on the lemon-rind, and pound it in a mortar until quite fine, and beat up the white of the egg until quite stiff; put the cream into a large bowl, with the sugar, wine, and beaten egg, and whip it to a froth; as fast as the froth rises, take it off with a skimmer, and put it on a sieve to drain, in a cool place.
10136-8{_}20619{_}This should be made the day before it is wanted, as the whip is then so much firmer.
10136-8{_}20620{_}The cream should be whipped in a cool place, and in summer, over ice, if it is obtainable.
10136-8{_}20621{_}A plain whipped cream may be served on a glass dish, and garnished with strips of angelica, or pastry leaves, or pieces of bright-coloured jelly: it makes a very pretty addition to the supper-table.

10136-8{_}20632{_}1489.
10136-8{_}20633{_}_Mode_.--Mix all the ingredients together, put the syllabub into glasses, and over the top of them heap a little whipped cream, made in the same manner as for trifle No.
10136-8{_}20634{_}1489.
10136-8{_}20635{_}Solid syllabub is made by whisking or milling the mixture to a stiff froth, and putting it in the glasses, without the whipped cream at the top.

10136-8{_}20640{_}THE CURE'S OMELET.
10136-8{_}20641{_}"Every one knows," says Brillat Savarin, in his "Physiology of Taste," "that for twenty years Madame Récamier was the most beautiful woman in Paris.
10136-8{_}20642{_}It is also well known that she was exceedingly charitable, and took a great interest in every benevolent work.
10136-8{_}20643{_}Wishing to consult the Curé of ---- respecting the working of an institution, she went to his house at five o'clock in the afternoon, and was much astonished at finding him already at his dinner-table.
10136-8{_}20644{_}"Madame Récamier wished to retire, but the Curé would not hear of it.
10136-8{_}20645{_}A neat white cloth covered the table; some good old wine sparkled in a crystal decanter; the porcelain was of the best; the plates had heaters of boiling water beneath them; a neatly-costumed maid-servant was in attendance.
10136-8{_}20646{_}The repast was a compromise between frugality and luxury.
10136-8{_}20647{_}The crawfish-soup had just been removed, and there was on the table a salmon-trout, an omelet, and a salad.
10136-8{_}20648{_}"'My dinner will tell you,' said the worthy Curé, with a smile, 'that it is fast-day, according to our Church's regulations.'
10136-8{_}20649{_}Madame Récamier and her host attacked the trout, the sauce served with which betrayed a skilful hand, the countenance of the Curé the while showing satisfaction.
10136-8{_}20650{_}"And now they fell upon the omelet, which was round, sufficiently thick, and cooked, so to speak, to a hair's-breadth.
10136-8{_}20651{_}"As the spoon entered the omelet, a thick rich juice issued from it, pleasant to the eye as well as to the smell; the dish became full of it; and our fair friend owns that, between the perfume and the sight, it made her mouth water.
10136-8{_}20652{_}"'It is an _omelette au thon_' (that is to say, a tunny omelet), said the Curé, noticing, with the greatest delight, the emotion of Madame Récamier, 'and few people taste it without lavishing praises on it.'
10136-8{_}20653{_}"'It surprises me not at all,' returned the beauty; 'never has so enticing an omelet met my gaze at any of our lay tables.'
10136-8{_}20654{_}"'My cook understands them well, I think.'
10136-8{_}20655{_}"'Yes,' added Madame, 'I never ate anything so delightful.'"
10136-8{_}20656{_}Then came the salad, which Savarin recommends to all who place confidence in him.
10136-8{_}20657{_}It refreshes without exciting; and he has a theory that it makes people younger.
10136-8{_}20658{_}Amidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived.
10136-8{_}20659{_}It consisted of three apples, cheese, and a plate of preserves; and then upon a little round table was served the Mocha coffee, for which France has been, and is, so justly famous.
10136-8{_}20660{_}"'I never,' said the Curé, 'take spirits; I always offer liqueurs to my guests but reserve the use of them, myself, to my old age, if it should please Providence to grant me that.'
10136-8{_}20661{_}"Finally, the charming Madame Récamier took her leave, and told all her friends of the delicious omelet which she had seen and partaken of."
10136-8{_}20662{_}And Brillat Savarin, in his capacity as the Layard of the concealed treasures of Gastronomia, has succeeded in withdrawing from obscurity the details of the preparation of which so much had been said, and which he imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable.
10136-8{_}20663{_}Here follows the recipe:--  OMELETTE AU THON.
10136-8{_}20664{_}1494.
10136-8{_}20665{_}Take, for 6 persons, the roes of 2 carp; [Footnote: An American writer says he has followed this recipe, substituting pike, shad, &c., in the place of carp, and can recommend all these also, with a quiet conscience.
10136-8{_}20666{_}Any fish, indeed, may be used with success.]
10136-8{_}20667{_}bleach them, by putting them, for 5 minutes, in boiling water slightly salted.
10136-8{_}20668{_}Take a piece of fresh tunny about the size of a hen's egg, to which add a small shalot already chopped; hash up together the roe and the tunny, so as to mix them well, and throw the whole into a saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of very good butter: whip it up until the butter is melted!
10136-8{_}20669{_}This constitutes the specialty of the omelet.
10136-8{_}20670{_}Take a second piece of butter, _à discrétion_, mix it with parsley and herbs, place it in a long-shaped dish destined to receive the omelet; squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, and place it on hot embers.
10136-8{_}20671{_}Beat up 12 eggs (the fresher the better); throw up the sauté of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to mix all well together; then make your omelet in the usual manner, endeavouring to turn it out long, thick, and soft.
10136-8{_}20672{_}Spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it, and serve at once.
10136-8{_}20673{_}This dish ought to be reserved for recherché déjeûners, or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to eat well; washed down with a good old wine, it will work wonders.
10136-8{_}20674{_}_Note_.--The roe and the tunny must be beaten up (sauté) without allowing them to boil, to prevent their hardening, which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs.
10136-8{_}20675{_}Your dish should be hollowed towards the centre, to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may be helped with a spoon.
10136-8{_}20676{_}The dish ought to be slightly heated, otherwise the cold china will extract all the heat from the omelet.

10136-8{_}20678{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ICES, AND DESSERT DISHES.
10136-8{_}20679{_}PRESERVES.
10136-8{_}20680{_}1495.
10136-8{_}20681{_}From the nature of vegetable substances, and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies, the mode of preserving them is somewhat different, although the general principles are the same.
10136-8{_}20682{_}All the means of preservation are put in practice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables, according to the nature of the species, the climate, the uses to which they are applied, &c. Some are dried, as nuts, raisins, sweet herbs, &c.; others are preserved by means of sugar, such as many fruits whose delicate juices would be lost by drying; some are preserved by means of vinegar, and chiefly used as condiments or pickles; a few also by salting, as French beans; while others are preserved in spirits.
10136-8{_}20683{_}We have, however, in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits.
10136-8{_}20684{_}Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health; the epicurean can scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it; therefore, as it is so invaluable, when we cannot have it fresh, we must have it preserved.
10136-8{_}20685{_}It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes.
10136-8{_}20686{_}The expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection; for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain.
10136-8{_}20687{_}Sugar also overpowers and destroys the sub-acid taste so desirable in many fruits: these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert.
10136-8{_}20688{_}Fruits intended for preservation should be gathered in the morning, in dry weather, with the morning sun upon them, if possible; they will then have their fullest flavour, and keep in good condition longer than when gathered at any other time.
10136-8{_}20689{_}Until fruit can be used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice-house, or a refrigerator.
10136-8{_}20690{_}In an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several days.
10136-8{_}20691{_}Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves.
10136-8{_}20692{_}1496.
10136-8{_}20693{_}Having secured the first and most important contribution to the manufacture of preserves,--the fruit, the next consideration is the preparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended; and this requires much care.
10136-8{_}20694{_}In the confectioner's art there is a great nicety in proportioning the degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to each particular case; and they know this by signs, and express it by certain technical terms.
10136-8{_}20695{_}But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience.
10136-8{_}20696{_}The principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled, its water will become evaporated, and its consistency will be thicker.
10136-8{_}20697{_}Great care must be taken in the management of the fire, that the syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar.
10136-8{_}20698{_}1497.
10136-8{_}20699{_}The first degree of consistency is called _the thread_, which is subdivided into the little and great thread.
10136-8{_}20700{_}If you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb, the tenacity of the syrup will, on separating the finger and thumb, afford a thread, which shortly breaks: this is the little thread.
10136-8{_}20701{_}If the thread, from the greater tenacity, and, consequently, greater strength of the syrup, admits of a greater extension of the finger and thumb, it is called the great thread.
10136-8{_}20702{_}There are half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various thickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called _caramel_; but that degree of sugar-boiling belongs to the confectioner.
10136-8{_}20703{_}A solution of sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of double-refined sugar (the best sugar is the most economical for preserves) in one of water, and boiling this a little, affords a syrup of the right degree of strength, and which neither ferments nor crystallizes.
10136-8{_}20704{_}This appears to be the degree called _smooth_ by the confectioners, and is proper to be used for the purposes of preserves.
10136-8{_}20705{_}The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified, which is done in the following manner:--Dissolve 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}20706{_}of loaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution the white of an egg, and beat it well.
10136-8{_}20707{_}Put the preserving-pan upon the fire with the solution; stir it with a wooden spatula, and, when it begins to swell and boil up, throw in some cold water or a little oil, to damp the boiling; for, as it rises suddenly, if it should boil over, it would take fire, being of a very inflammable nature.
10136-8{_}20708{_}Let it boil up again; then take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen.
10136-8{_}20709{_}Boil the solution again, throw in a little more cold water, remove the scum, and so on for three or four times successively; then strain it.
10136-8{_}20710{_}It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.
10136-8{_}20711{_}1498.
10136-8{_}20712{_}Although sugar passes so easily into the state of fermentation, and is, in fact, the only substance capable of undergoing the vinous stage of that process, yet it will not ferment at all if the quantity be sufficient to constitute a very strong syrup: hence, syrups are used to preserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they would undergo if left to themselves.
10136-8{_}20713{_}Before sugar was in use, honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar-cane.
10136-8{_}20714{_}1499.
10136-8{_}20715{_}The fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are, apricots, peaches, nectarines, apples, greengages, plums of all kinds, and pears.
10136-8{_}20716{_}As an example, take some apricots not too ripe, make a small slit at the stem end, and push out the stone; simmer them in water till they are softened and about half done, and afterwards throw them into cold water.
10136-8{_}20717{_}When they have cooled, take them out and drain them.
10136-8{_}20718{_}Put the apricots into the pie-serving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover them; let them boil up three or four times, and then skim them; remove them from the fire, pour them into an earthen pan, and let them cool till next day.
10136-8{_}20719{_}Boil them up three days successively, skimming each time, and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use.
10136-8{_}20720{_}After each bailing, it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling; if too thick, it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard.
10136-8{_}20721{_}The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving-pan into an earthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of which the preserving-pans are usually made.
10136-8{_}20722{_}From this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended.
10136-8{_}20723{_}The first object is to soften the fruit by blanching or boiling it in water, in order that the syrup by which it is preserved may penetrate through its substance.
10136-8{_}20724{_}1500.
10136-8{_}20725{_}Many fruits, when preserved by boiling, lose much of their peculiar and delicate flavour, as, for instance, pine-apples; and this inconvenience may, in some instances, be remedied by preserving them without heat.
10136-8{_}20726{_}Cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick, strew powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a jar, and put the slices on it.
10136-8{_}20727{_}Put more sugar on this, and then another layer of the slices, and so on till the jar is full.
10136-8{_}20728{_}Place the jar with the fruit up to the neck in boiling water, and keep it there till the sugar is completely dissolved, which may take half an hour, removing the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}20729{_}Lastly, tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax it.
10136-8{_}20730{_}1501.
10136-8{_}20731{_}Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate.
10136-8{_}20732{_}They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned.
10136-8{_}20733{_}Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers or boxes.
10136-8{_}20734{_}Currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, are extremely elegant, and have a fine flavour.
10136-8{_}20735{_}In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved.
10136-8{_}20736{_}1502.
10136-8{_}20737{_}Marmalades, jams, and fruit pastes are of the same nature, and are now in very general request.
10136-8{_}20738{_}They are prepared without difficulty, by attending to a very few directions; they are somewhat expensive, but may be kept without spoiling for a considerable time.
10136-8{_}20739{_}Marmalades and jams differ little from each other: they are preserves of a half-liquid consistency, made by boiling the pulp of fruits, and sometimes part of the rinds, with sugar.
10136-8{_}20740{_}The appellation of marmalade is applied to those confitures which are composed of the firmer fruits, as pineapples or the rinds of oranges; whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries, such as strawberries, raspberries, currants, mulberries, &c. Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated to a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar.
10136-8{_}20741{_}The mixture is then poured into a mould, or spread on sheets of tin, and subsequently dried in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state of a paste.
10136-8{_}20742{_}From a sheet of this paste, strips may be cut and formed into any shape that may be desired, as knots, rings, &c. Jams require the same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade; the slightest degree of burning communicates a disagreeable empyreumatic taste, and if they are not boiled sufficiently, they will not keep.
10136-8{_}20743{_}That they may keep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar.
10136-8{_}20744{_}1503.
10136-8{_}20745{_}In all the operations for preserve-making, when the preserving-pan is used, it should not be placed on the fire, but on a trivet, unless the jam is made on a hot plate, when this is not necessary.
10136-8{_}20746{_}If the pan is placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to burn, and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled.
10136-8{_}20747{_}1504.
10136-8{_}20748{_}Fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with sugar, concentrated, by boiling, to such a consistency that the liquid, upon cooling, assumes the form of a tremulous jelly.
10136-8{_}20749{_}1505.
10136-8{_}20750{_}Before fruits are candied, they must first be boiled in syrup, after which they are taken out and dried on a stove, or before the fire; the syrup is then to be concentrated, or boiled to a candy height, and the fruit dipped in it, and again laid on the stove to dry and candy: they are then to be put into boxes, and kept dry.
10136-8{_}20751{_}1506.
10136-8{_}20752{_}Conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform mass with refined sugar, and they are intended to preserve the virtues and properties of recent flowers, leaves, roots, peels, or fruits, unaltered, and as near as possible to what they were when fresh gathered, and to give them an agreeable taste.
10136-8{_}20753{_}1507.
10136-8{_}20754{_}The last-mentioned, but not the least-important preparation of fruit, is the _compôte,_ a confiture made at the moment of need, and with much less sugar than would be ordinarily put to preserves.
10136-8{_}20755{_}They are most wholesome things, suitable to most stomachs which cannot accommodate themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar: they are the happy medium, and far better than ordinary stewed fruit.
10136-8{_}20756{_}CONFECTIONARY.
10136-8{_}20757{_}1508.
10136-8{_}20758{_}In speaking of confectionary, it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come, strictly speaking, under that head; for the various fruits, flowers, herbs, roots, and juices, which, when boiled with sugar, were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats, were called _confections_, from the Latin word _conficere_, 'to make up;' but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food, many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine.
10136-8{_}20759{_}The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner: they cannot profitably be made at home.
10136-8{_}20760{_}Apart from these, cakes, biscuits, and tarts, &c., the class of sweetmeats called confections may be thus classified:--1.
10136-8{_}20761{_}Liquid confects, or fruits either whole or in pieces, preserved by being immersed in a fluid transparent syrup; as the liquid confects of apricots, green citrons, and many foreign fruits.
10136-8{_}20762{_}2.
10136-8{_}20763{_}Dry confects are those which, after having been boiled in the syrup, are taken out and put to dry in an oven, as citron and orange-peel, &c. 3.
10136-8{_}20764{_}Marmalade, jams, and pastes, a kind of soft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable substances, beat up with sugar or honey; such as oranges, apricots, pears, &c. 4.
10136-8{_}20765{_}Jellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency, so as, upon cooling, to form a trembling jelly; as currant, gooseberry, apple jelly, &c. 5.
10136-8{_}20766{_}Conserves are a kind of dry confects, made by beating up flowers, fruits, &c., with sugar, not dissolved.
10136-8{_}20767{_}6.
10136-8{_}20768{_}Candies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in the syrup.
10136-8{_}20769{_}DESSERT DISHES.
10136-8{_}20770{_}1509.
10136-8{_}20771{_}With moderns the dessert is not so profuse, nor does it hold the same relationship to the dinner that it held with the ancients,--the Romans more especially.
10136-8{_}20772{_}On ivory tables they would spread hundreds of different kinds of raw, cooked, and preserved fruits, tarts and cakes, as substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the guests were satiated.
10136-8{_}20773{_}However, as late as the reigns of our two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
10136-8{_}20774{_}The dessert certainly repays, in its general effect, the expenditure upon it of much pains; and it may be said, that if there be any poetry at all in meals, or the process of feeding, there is poetry in the dessert, the materials for which should be selected with taste, and, of course, must depend, in a great measure, upon the season.
10136-8{_}20775{_}Pines, melons, grapes, peaches, nectarines, plums, strawberries, apples, pears, oranges, almonds, raisins, figs, walnuts, filberts, medlars, cherries, &c. &c., all kinds of dried fruits, and choice and delicately-flavoured cakes and biscuits, make up the dessert, together with the most costly and _recherché_ wines.
10136-8{_}20776{_}The shape of the dishes varies at different periods, the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems.
10136-8{_}20777{_}The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion; some persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others, elegantly-shaped glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges.
10136-8{_}20778{_}The beauty of the dessert services at the tables of the wealthy tends to enhance the splendour of the plate.
10136-8{_}20779{_}The general mode of putting a dessert on table, now the elegant tazzas are fashionable, is, to place them down the middle of the table, a tall and short dish alternately; the fresh fruits being arranged on the tall dishes, and dried fruits, bon-bons, &c., on small round or oval glass plates.
10136-8{_}20780{_}The garnishing needs especial attention, as the contrast of the brilliant-coloured fruits with nicely-arranged foliage is very charming.
10136-8{_}20781{_}The garnish _par excellence_ for dessert is the ice-plant; its crystallized dewdrops producing a marvellous effect in the height of summer, giving a most inviting sense of coolness to the fruit it encircles.
10136-8{_}20782{_}The double-edged mallow, strawberry, and vine leaves have a pleasing effect; and for winter desserts, the bay, cuba, and laurel are sometimes used.
10136-8{_}20783{_}In town, the expense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great, but paper and composite leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price.
10136-8{_}20784{_}Mixed fruits of the larger sort are now frequently served on one dish.
10136-8{_}20785{_}This mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement of the fruit: for instance, a pine in the centre of the dish, surrounded with large plums of various sorts and colours, mixed with pears, rosy-cheeked apples, all arranged with a due regard to colour, have a very good effect.
10136-8{_}20786{_}Again, apples and pears look well mingled with plums and grapes, hanging from the border of the dish in a _négligé_ sort of manner, with a large bunch of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples.
10136-8{_}20787{_}A dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections.
10136-8{_}20788{_}The candied fruits may be purchased at a less cost than they can be manufactured at home.
10136-8{_}20789{_}They are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms.
10136-8{_}20790{_}And since, from the facilities of travel, we have become so familiar with the tables of the French, chocolate in different forms is indispensable to our desserts.
10136-8{_}20791{_}ICES.
10136-8{_}20792{_}510.
10136-8{_}20793{_}Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed cream or water, combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients, or more generally with the juices of fruits.
10136-8{_}20794{_}At desserts, or at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with.
10136-8{_}20795{_}The principal utensils required for making ice-creams are ice-tubs, freezing-pots, spaddles, and a cellaret.
10136-8{_}20796{_}The tub must be large enough to contain about a bushel of ice, pounded small, when brought out of the ice-house, and mixed very carefully with either _salt, nitre,_ or _soda._ The freezing-pot is best made of pewter.
10136-8{_}20797{_}If it be of tin, as is sometimes the case, the congelation goes on too rapidly in it for the thorough intermingling of its contents, on which the excellence of the ice greatly depends.
10136-8{_}20798{_}The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
10136-8{_}20799{_}The cellaret is a tin vessel, in which ices are kept for a short time from dissolving.
10136-8{_}20800{_}The method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to.
10136-8{_}20801{_}When the ice-tub is prepared with fresh-pounded ice and salt, the freezing-pot is put into it up to its cover.
10136-8{_}20802{_}The articles to be congealed are then poured into it and covered over; but to prevent the ingredients from separating and the heaviest of them from falling to the bottom of the mould, it is requisite to turn the freezing-pot round and round by the handle, so as to keep its contents moving until the congelation commences.
10136-8{_}20803{_}As soon as this is perceived (the cover of the pot being occasionally taken off for the purpose of noticing when freezing takes place), the cover is immediately closed over it, ice is put upon it, and it is left in this state till it is served.
10136-8{_}20804{_}The use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream, which in the shaking may have washed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent waste of it occurring.
10136-8{_}20805{_}Any negligence in stirring the contents of the freezing-pot before congelation takes place, will destroy the whole: either the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice insufficiently sweetened, or lumps are formed, which disfigure and discolour it.
10136-8{_}20806{_}1511.
10136-8{_}20807{_}The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages; even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation.
10136-8{_}20808{_}They should be taken immediately after the repast, or some hours after, because the taking these substances _during_ the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition.
10136-8{_}20809{_}It is necessary, then, that this function should have scarcely commenced, or that it should be completely finished, before partaking of ices.
10136-8{_}20810{_}It is also necessary to abstain from them when persons are very warm, or immediately after taking violent exercise, as in some cases they have produced illnesses which have ended fatally.
10136-8{_}20811{_}[Do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices, which all the fair sex are passionately fond of?--To Catherine de' Medici.
10136-8{_}20812{_}Will not this fact cover a multitude of sins committed by the instigator of St. Bartholomew ?]
10136-8{_}20813{_}RECIPES.
10136-8{_}20814{_}CHAPTER XXXI.
10136-8{_}20815{_}TO MAKE SYRUP FOR COMPOTES, &c.  1512.
10136-8{_}20816{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}20817{_}of sugar allow 1-1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}20818{_}_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises: the syrup is then ready for the fruit.
10136-8{_}20819{_}The articles boiled in this syrup will not keep for any length of time, it being suitable only for dishes intended to be eaten immediately.
10136-8{_}20820{_}A larger proportion of sugar must be added for a syrup intended to keep.
10136-8{_}20821{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}20822{_}TO CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP.
10136-8{_}20823{_}1513.
10136-8{_}20824{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}20825{_}of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water and 1/2 the white of an egg.
10136-8{_}20826{_}_Mode_.--Put the sugar, water, and the white of the egg, which should, be well beaten, into a preserving-pan or lined saucepan; and do not put it on the fire till the sugar is dissolved.
10136-8{_}20827{_}Then place it on the fire, and when it boils, throw in a teacupful of cold water, and do not stir the sugar after this is added.
10136-8{_}20828{_}Bring it to the boiling-point again, and then place the pan by the side of the fire, for the preparation to settle.
10136-8{_}20829{_}Remove all the scum, and the sugar will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}20830{_}The scum should be placed on a sieve, so that what syrup runs from it may be boiled up again: this must also be well skimmed.
10136-8{_}20831{_}_Time_.--20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve; 5 minutes to boil.
10136-8{_}20832{_}_Note_.--The above two recipes are those used in the preparation of dishes usually made at home.
10136-8{_}20833{_}There are many degrees of boiling sugar, which process requires great care, attention, and experience.
10136-8{_}20834{_}Caramel sugar, which makes an elegant cover for sweetmeats, is difficult to prepare, and is best left to an experienced confectioner.
10136-8{_}20835{_}We give the recipe, for those of our readers who care to attempt the operation.
10136-8{_}20836{_}TO BOIL SUGAR TO CARAMEL.
10136-8{_}20837{_}1514.
10136-8{_}20838{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}20839{_}of lump sugar allow 1 gill of spring water.
10136-8{_}20840{_}_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear fire, skimming it very carefully as soon as it boils.
10136-8{_}20841{_}Keep it boiling until the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in a pan of cold water.
10136-8{_}20842{_}If it remains hard, the sugar has attained the right degree; then squeeze in a little lemon-juice, and let it remain an instant on the fire.
10136-8{_}20843{_}Set the pan into another of cold water, and the caramel is then ready for use.
10136-8{_}20844{_}The insides of well-oiled moulds are often ornamented with this sugar, which with a fork should be spread over them in fine threads or network.
10136-8{_}20845{_}A dish of light pastry, tastefully arranged, looks very prettily with this sugar spun lightly over it.
10136-8{_}20846{_}The sugar must be carefully watched, and taken up the instant it is done.
10136-8{_}20847{_}Unless the cook is very experienced and thoroughly understands her business, it is scarcely worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament, as it may be purchased quite as economically at a confectioner's, if the failures in the preparation are taken into consideration.

10136-8{_}20851{_}INGREDIENTS.--6 ripe apples, 1 lemon, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}20852{_}of lump sugar, 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}20853{_}[Illustration: COMPÔTE OF APPLES.]
10136-8{_}20854{_}_Mode_.--Select the apples of a moderate size, peel them, cut them in halves, remove the cores, and rub each piece over with a little lemon.
10136-8{_}20855{_}Put the sugar and water together into a lined saucepan, and let them boil until forming a thickish syrup, when lay in the apples with the rind of the lemon cut thin, and the juice of the same.
10136-8{_}20856{_}Let the apples simmer till tender; then take them out very carefully, drain them on a sieve, and reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for a few minutes.
10136-8{_}20857{_}When both are cold, arrange the apples neatly on a glass dish, pour over the syrup, and garnish with strips of green angelica or candied citron.
10136-8{_}20858{_}Smaller apples may be dressed in the same manner: they should not be divided in half, but peeled and the cores pushed out with a vegetable-cutter.
10136-8{_}20859{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water together; from 15 to 25 minutes to simmer the apples.

10136-8{_}21092{_}Let it cool, cover the top of the jam with oiled paper, and the top of the jars with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg: this, when cold, forms a hard stiff cover, and perfectly excludes the air.
10136-8{_}21093{_}Great attention must be paid to the stirring of this jam, as it is very liable to burn, on account of the thickness of the juice.
10136-8{_}21094{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the fruit and water; 30 minutes with the sugar, or longer.
10136-8{_}21095{_}_Average cost_, from 6d.
10136-8{_}21096{_}to 8d.
10136-8{_}21097{_}for a pot capable of holding 1 lb.
10136-8{_}21098{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 1 dozen pots of jam, each pot to hold 1 lb.
10136-8{_}21099{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.
10136-8{_}21100{_}BLACK-CURRANT JELLY.
10136-8{_}21101{_}1531.
10136-8{_}21102{_}INGREDIENTS.--Black currants; to every pint of juice allow 1/4 pint of water, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}21103{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21104{_}_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks, which may be done in an expeditious manner, by holding the bunch in one hand, and passing a small silver fork down the currants: they will then readily fall from the stalks.
10136-8{_}21105{_}Put them into a jar, place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer them until their juice is extracted; then strain them, and to every pint of juice allow the above proportion of sugar and water; stir these ingredients together cold until the sugar is dissolved; place the preserving-pan on the fire, and boil the jelly for about 1/2 hour, reckoning from the time it commences to boil all over, and carefully remove the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}21106{_}If the jelly becomes firm when a little is put on a plate, it is done; it should then be put into _small_ pots, and covered the same as the jam in the preceding recipe.
10136-8{_}21107{_}If the jelly is wanted very clear, the fruit should not be squeezed dry; but, of course, so much juice will not be obtained.
10136-8{_}21108{_}If the fruit is not much squeezed, it may be converted into a jam for immediate eating, by boiling it with a little common sugar: this answers very well for a nursery preserve.
10136-8{_}21109{_}_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to extract the juice; 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.
10136-8{_}21110{_}_Average cost_, from 8d.

10136-8{_}21115{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.
10136-8{_}21116{_}RED-CURRANT JAM.
10136-8{_}21117{_}1532.
10136-8{_}21118{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}21119{_}of fruit allow 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21120{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21121{_}[Illustration: JAM-POT.]
10136-8{_}21122{_}_Mode_.--Let the fruit be gathered on a fine day; weigh it, and then strip the currants from the stalks; put them into a preserving-pan with sugar in the above proportion; stir them, and boil them for about 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}21123{_}Carefully remove the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}21124{_}Put the jam into pots, and, when cold, cover with oiled papers; over these put a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg; press the paper round the top of the pot, and, when dry, the covering will be quite hard and air-tight.
10136-8{_}21125{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour, reckoning from the time the jam boils all over.
10136-8{_}21126{_}_Average cost_, for a lb.
10136-8{_}21127{_}pot, from 6d.
10136-8{_}21128{_}to 8d.
10136-8{_}21129{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 12 1-lb, pots of jam.

10136-8{_}21131{_}RED-CURRANT JELLY.
10136-8{_}21132{_}1533.
10136-8{_}21133{_}INGREDIENTS.--Red currants; to every pint of juice allow 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21134{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21135{_}_Mode_.--Have the fruit gathered in fine weather; pick it from the stalks, put it into a jar, and place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and let it simmer gently until the juice is well drawn from the currants; then strain them through a jelly-bag or fine cloth, and, if the jelly is wished very clear, do not squeeze them _too much_, as the skin and pulp from the fruit will be pressed through with the juice, and so make the jelly muddy.
10136-8{_}21136{_}Measure the juice, and to each pint allow 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21137{_}of loaf sugar; put these into a preserving-pan, set it over the fire, and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully removing every particle of scum as it rises, using a wooden or silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil the colour of the jelly when it has boiled from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, put a little of the jelly on a plate, and if firm when cool, it is done.
10136-8{_}21138{_}Take it off the fire, pour it into small gallipots, cover each of the pots with an oiled paper, and then with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg.
10136-8{_}21139{_}Label the pots, adding the year when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry place.
10136-8{_}21140{_}A jam may be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh raspberries, and boiling all together, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely.
10136-8{_}21141{_}As this preserve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller proportion of sugar than usual will be found enough: it answers very well for children's puddings, or for a nursery preserve.
10136-8{_}21142{_}_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to extract the juice; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.
10136-8{_}21143{_}_Average cost_, from 8d.
10136-8{_}21144{_}to 10d.

10136-8{_}21146{_}pot.
10136-8{_}21147{_}_Sufficient_.--8 quarts of currants will make from 10 to 12 pots of jelly.
10136-8{_}21148{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.
10136-8{_}21149{_}_Note_.--Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient for some tastes, add an extra 1/4 lb.

10136-8{_}21154{_}of good loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21155{_}_Mode_.--Pick the currants from the stalks, and put them into a jar; place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer until the juice is well drawn from the fruit, which will be in from 3/4 to 1 hour.
10136-8{_}21156{_}Then strain the currants through a fine cloth or jelly-bag; do not squeeze them too much, or the jelly will not be clear, and put the juice into a very clean preserving-pan, with the sugar.
10136-8{_}21157{_}Let this simmer gently over a clear fire until it is firm, and keep stirring and skimming until it is done; then pour it into small pots, cover them, and store away in a dry place.
10136-8{_}21158{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour to draw the juice; 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.
10136-8{_}21159{_}_Average cost_, from 8d.

10136-8{_}21172{_}Put the fruit into large dry stone jars, sprinkling the sugar amongst it; cover the jars with saucers, place them in a rather cool oven, and bake the fruit until it is quite tender.
10136-8{_}21173{_}When cold, cover the top of the fruit with a piece of white paper cut to the size of the jar; pour over this melted mutton suet about an inch thick, and cover the tops of the jars with thick brown paper, well tied down.
10136-8{_}21174{_}Keep the jars in a cool dry place, and the fruit will remain good till the following Christmas, but not much longer.
10136-8{_}21175{_}_Time_.--From 5 to 6 hours to bake the damsons, in a very cool oven.

10136-8{_}21181{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21182{_}_Mode_.--Pick the stalks from the damsons, and put them into a preserving-pan; simmer them over the fire until they are soft, occasionally stirring them; then beat them through a coarse sieve, and put the pulp and juice into the preserving-pan, with sugar in the above proportion, having previously carefully weighed them.
10136-8{_}21183{_}Stir the sugar well in, and simmer the damsons slowly for 2 hours.
10136-8{_}21184{_}Skim well; then boil the preserve quickly for 1/2 hour, or until it looks firm and hard in the spoon; put it quickly into shallow pots, or very tiny earthenware moulds, and, when cold, cover it with oiled papers, and the jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg.
10136-8{_}21185{_}A few of the stones may be cracked, and the kernels boiled with the damsons, which very much improves the flavour of the cheese.
10136-8{_}21186{_}_Time_.--1 hour to boil the damsons without the sugar; 2 hours to simmer them slowly, 1/2 hour quickly.
10136-8{_}21187{_}_Average cost_, from 8d.

10136-8{_}21215{_}Boil the jam for about an hour, reckoning from the time it commences to simmer all over alike: it must be well stirred all the time, or it will be liable to burn and stick to the pan, which will cause the jam to have a very disagreeable flavour.
10136-8{_}21216{_}When the jam looks firm, and the juice appears to set, it is done.
10136-8{_}21217{_}Then take it off the fire, put into pots, cover it down, when quite cold, with oiled and egged papers, the same as in recipe No.

10136-8{_}21263{_}_Mode_.--Let the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe, and gathered in dry weather.
10136-8{_}21264{_}Pick it off the stalks without bruising or breaking the skin, and reject any that is at all blemished: if gathered in the damp, or if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will mould.
10136-8{_}21265{_}Have ready some _perfectly dry_ glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks or bungs; burn a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, and quickly place the fruit in to be preserved; gently cork the bottles, and put them into a very cool oven, where let them remain until the fruit has shrunk away a fourth part.
10136-8{_}21266{_}Then take the bottles out; _do not open them,_ but immediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and cover them with melted resin.
10136-8{_}21267{_}If kept in a dry place, the fruit will remain good for months; and on this principally depends the success of the preparation; for if stored away in a place that is in the least damp, the fruit will soon spoil.

10136-8{_}21273{_}Let it be carefully picked and put into the bottles, which must be clean and perfectly dry.
10136-8{_}21274{_}Tie over the tops of the bottles pieces of bladder; stand the bottles in a large pot, copper, or boiler, with cold water to reach to their necks; kindle a fire under, let the water boil, and as the bladders begin to rise and puff, prick them.
10136-8{_}21275{_}As soon as the water boils, extinguish the fire, and let the bottles remain where they are, to become cold.
10136-8{_}21276{_}The next day remove the bladders, and strew over the fruit a thick layer of pounded sugar; fit the bottles with corks, and let each cork lie close at hand to its own bottle.
10136-8{_}21277{_}Hold for a few moments, in the neck of the bottle, two or three lighted matches, and when they have filled the bottle neck with gas, and before they go out, remove them very quickly; instantly cork the bottle closely, and dip it in bottle cement.

10136-8{_}21488{_}Lay them to dry on paper, when the sugar will crystallize round each currant, and have a very pretty effect.
10136-8{_}21489{_}All fresh fruit may be prepared in the same manner; and a mixture of various fruits iced in this manner, and arranged on one dish, looks very well for a summer dessert.

10136-8{_}21496{_}A border of any other kind of small fruit, arranged round the melon, has a pretty effect, the colour the former contrasting nicely with the melon.
10136-8{_}21497{_}Plenty of pounded sugar should be served with it; and the fruit should be cut lengthwise, in moderate-sized slices.
10136-8{_}21498{_}In America, it is frequently eaten with pepper and salt.

10136-8{_}21513{_}With us, it is used only at the dessert, and     is generally eaten with sugar, ginger, or pepper; but, in     France, it is likewise served up at dinner as a sauce for boiled     meats.
10136-8{_}21514{_}It grows wild in Tartary, and has been lately found in     abundance on the sandy plains of Jeypoor.
10136-8{_}21515{_}It was brought     originally from Asia by the Romans, and is said to have been     common in England in the time of Edward III., though it is     supposed that it was lost again, as well as the cucumber, during     the wars of York and Lancaster.
10136-8{_}21516{_}The best kind, called the     _Cantaloupe_, from the name of a place near Rome where it was     first cultivated in Europe, is a native of Armenia, where it     grows so plentifully that a horse-load may be bought for a     crown.

10136-8{_}21524{_}Put the sugar into the preserving-pan, moisten it with the juice, boil it up, skim well, and then add the mulberries, which should be ripe, but not soft enough to break to a pulp.
10136-8{_}21525{_}Let them stand in the syrup till warm through, then set them on the fire to boil gently; when half done, turn them carefully into an earthen pan, and let them remain till the next day; then boil them as before, and when the syrup is thick, and becomes firm when cold, put the preserve into pots.
10136-8{_}21526{_}In making this, care should be taken not to break the mulberries: this may be avoided by very gentle stirring, and by simmering the fruit very slowly.
10136-8{_}21527{_}_Time_.--3/4 hour to extract the juice;  1/4 hour to boil the mulberries the first time, 1/4 hour the second time.
10136-8{_}21528{_}_Seasonable_ in August and September.
10136-8{_}21529{_}[Illustration: MULBERRY.]
10136-8{_}21530{_}MULBERRY.--Mulberries are esteemed for their highly aromatic flavour, and their sub-acid nature.
10136-8{_}21531{_}They are considered as cooling, laxative, and generally wholesome.
10136-8{_}21532{_}This fruit was very highly esteemed by the Romans, who appear to have preferred it to every other.
10136-8{_}21533{_}The mulberry-tree is stated to have been introduced into this country in 1548, being first planted at Sion House, where the original trees still thrive.
10136-8{_}21534{_}The planting of them was much encouraged by King James I. about 1605; and considerable attempts were made at that time to rear silkworms on a large scale for the purpose of making silk; but these endeavours have always failed, the climate being scarcely warm enough.

10136-8{_}21550{_}THE CHERRY-TREE IN ROME.--The Cherry-tree was introduced into Rome by Lucullus about seventy years before the Christian era; but the capital of the world knew not at first how to appreciate this present as it deserved; for the cherry-tree was propagated so slowly in Italy, that more than a century after its introduction it was far from being generally cultivated.
10136-8{_}21551{_}The Romans distinguished three principal species of cherries--the _Apronian_, of a bright red, with a firm and delicate pulp; the _Lutatian_, very black and sweet; the _Caecilian_, round and stubby, and much esteemed.
10136-8{_}21552{_}The cherry embellished the third course in Rome and the second at Athens.

10136-8{_}21609{_}Not more than two centuries ago, the Portuguese brought thence the first scion, which has multiplied so prodigiously that we now see entire forests of orange-trees in Portugal.
10136-8{_}21610{_}ORANGE AND CLOVES.--It appears to have been the custom formerly, in England, to make new year's presents with oranges stuck full with cloves.
10136-8{_}21611{_}We read in one of Ben Jonson's pieces,--the "Christmas Masque,"--"He has an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it."

10136-8{_}21711{_}PEACH AND NECTARINE.--The peach and nectarine, which are among     the most delicious of our fruits, are considered as varieties of     the same species, produced by cultivation.
10136-8{_}21712{_}The former is     characterized by a very delicate down, while the latter is     smooth; but, as a proof of their identity as to species, trees     have borne peaches on one part and nectarines on another; and     even a single fruit has had down on one side, and on the other     none; the trees are almost exactly alike, as well as the     blossoms.
10136-8{_}21713{_}Pliny states that the peach was originally brought     from Persia, where it grows naturally.
10136-8{_}21714{_}At Montreuil, a village     near Paris, almost the whole population is employed in the     cultivation of peaches; and this occupation has maintained the     inhabitants for ages, and, in consequence, they raise better     peaches than anywhere else in France.
10136-8{_}21715{_}In Maryland and Virginia,     peaches grow nearly wild in orchards resembling forests; but the     fruit is of little value for the table, being employed only in     fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy.
10136-8{_}21716{_}On the     east side of the Andes, peaches grow wild among the cornfields     and in the mountains, and are dried as an article of food.
10136-8{_}21717{_}The     young leaves of the peach are sometimes used in cookery, from     their agreeable flavour; and a liqueur resembling the fine     noyeau of Martinique may be made by steeping them in brandy     sweetened with sugar and fined with milk: gin may also be     flavoured in the same manner.
10136-8{_}21718{_}The kernels of the fruit have the     same flavour.
10136-8{_}21719{_}The nectarine is said to have received its name     from nectar, the particular drink of the gods.
10136-8{_}21720{_}Though it is     considered as the same species as the peach, it is not known     which of the varieties come from the other; the nectarine, is by     some considered as the superior fruit.

10136-8{_}21736{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21737{_}_Mode_.--Pare and cut the pears into halves, and, should they be very large, into quarters; leave the stalks on, and carefully remove the cores.
10136-8{_}21738{_}Place them in a clean baking-jar, with a closely-fitting lid; add to them the lemon-rind cut in strips, the juice of 1/2 lemon, the cloves, pounded allspice, and sufficient water just to cover the whole, with sugar in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}21739{_}Cover the jar down closely, put it into a very cool oven, and bake the pears from 5 to 6 hours, but be very careful that the oven is not too hot.
10136-8{_}21740{_}To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added; but this will not be found necessary if the pears are very gently baked.
10136-8{_}21741{_}_Time_.--Large pears, 5 to 6 hours, in a very slow oven.
10136-8{_}21742{_}_Average cost_, 1d.

10136-8{_}21746{_}_Seasonable_ from September to January.
10136-8{_}21747{_}PEAR.--The pear, like the apple, is indigenous to this country;     but the wild pear is a very unsatisfactory fruit.
10136-8{_}21748{_}The best     varieties were brought from the East by the Romans, who     cultivated them with care, and probably introduced some of their     best sorts into this island, to which others were added by the     inhabitants of the monasteries.
10136-8{_}21749{_}The Dutch and Flemings, as well     as the French, have excelled in the cultivation of the pear, and     most of the late varieties introduced are from France and     Flanders.
10136-8{_}21750{_}The pear is a hardy tree, and a longer liver than the     apple: it has been known to exist for centuries.
10136-8{_}21751{_}There are now     about 150 varieties of this fruit.
10136-8{_}21752{_}Though perfectly wholesome     when ripe, the pear is not so when green; but in this state it     is fit for stewing.
10136-8{_}21753{_}An agreeable beverage, called perry, is made     from pears, and the varieties which are least fit for eating     make the best perry.
10136-8{_}21754{_}PRESERVED PEARS.
10136-8{_}21755{_}1575.
10136-8{_}21756{_}INGREDIENTS.--Jargonelle pears; to every lb.
10136-8{_}21757{_}of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}21758{_}_Mode_.--Procure some Jargonelle pears, not too ripe; put them into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and simmer them till rather tender, but do not allow them to break; then put them into cold water.
10136-8{_}21759{_}Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes, skim well, put in the pears, and simmer them gently for 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}21760{_}Repeat the simmering for 3 successive days, taking care not to let the fruit break.
10136-8{_}21761{_}The last time of boiling, the syrup should be made rather richer, and the fruit boiled for 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}21762{_}When the pears are done, drain them from the syrup, and dry them in the sun, or in a cool oven; or they may be kept in the syrup, and dried as they are wanted.
10136-8{_}21763{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to simmer the pears in water, 20 minutes in the syrup.

10136-8{_}21772{_}of loaf sugar, 6 cloves, 6 whole allspice, 1/2 pint of water, 1/4 pint of port wine, a few drops of prepared cochineal.
10136-8{_}21773{_}_Mode_.--Pare the pears, halve them, remove the cores, and leave the stalks on; put them into a _lined_ saucepan with the above ingredients, and let them simmer very gently until tender, which will be in from 3 to 4 hours, according to the quality of the pears.
10136-8{_}21774{_}They should be watched, and, when done, carefully lifted out on to a glass dish without breaking them.
10136-8{_}21775{_}Boil up the syrup quickly for 2 or 3 minutes; allow it to cool a little, pour it over the pears, and let them get perfectly cold.
10136-8{_}21776{_}To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added, which rather enhances the beauty of this dish.
10136-8{_}21777{_}The fruit must not be boiled fast, but only simmered, and watched that it be not too much done.
10136-8{_}21778{_}_Time_.--3 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}21779{_}_Average cost_, 1s.

10136-8{_}21782{_}_Seasonable_ from September to January.
10136-8{_}21783{_}THE BON CHRETIEN PEAR.--The valuable variety of pear called _Bon     Chrétien_, which comes to our tables in winter, either raw or     cooked, received its name through the following incident:--Louis     XI., king of France, had sent for Saint Francois de Paule from     the lower part of Calabria, in the hopes of recovering his     health through his intercession.
10136-8{_}21784{_}The saint brought with him the     seeds of this pear; and, as he was called at court Le Bon     Chrétien, this fruit obtained the name of him to whom France     owed its introduction.

10136-8{_}21788{_}_Mode_.--Pare and slice the fruit thinly, put it on dishes, and strew over it plenty of pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}21789{_}Keep it in a hot closet, or very slow oven, 8 or 10 days, and turn the fruit every day until dry; then put the pieces of pine on tins, and place them in a quick oven for 10 minutes.
10136-8{_}21790{_}Let them cool, and store them away in dry boxes, with paper between each layer.
10136-8{_}21791{_}_Time_.--8 to 10 days.
10136-8{_}21792{_}_Seasonable_.--Foreign pines, in July and August.

10136-8{_}21795{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}21796{_}of fruit, weighed after being pared, allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}21797{_}of loaf sugar; 1/4 pint of water.
10136-8{_}21798{_}_Mode_.--The pines for making this preserve should be perfectly sound but ripe.
10136-8{_}21799{_}Cut them into rather thick slices, as the fruit shrinks very much in the boiling.
10136-8{_}21800{_}Pare off the rind carefully, that none of the pine be wasted; and, in doing so, notch it in and out, as the edge cannot be smoothly cut without great waste.
10136-8{_}21801{_}Dissolve a portion of the sugar in a preserving-pan with 1/4 pint of water; when this is melted, gradually add the remainder of the sugar, and boil it until it forms a clear syrup, skimming well.
10136-8{_}21802{_}As soon as this is the case, put in the pieces of pine, and boil well for at least 1/2 hour, or until it looks nearly transparent.
10136-8{_}21803{_}Put it into pots, cover down when cold, and store away in a dry place.
10136-8{_}21804{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to boil the fruit.

10136-8{_}21809{_}_Seasonable_.--Foreign pines, in July and August.
10136-8{_}21810{_}THE PINEAPPLE IN HEATHENDOM.--Heathen nations invented     protective divinities for their orchards (such as Pomona,     Vertumnus, Priapus, &c.), and benevolent patrons for their     fruits: thus, the olive-tree grew under the auspices of Minerva;     the Muses cherished the palm-tree, Bacchus the fig and grape,     _and the pine and its cone were consecrated to the great Cyble_.
10136-8{_}21811{_}PRESERVED PINEAPPLE, for Present Use.
10136-8{_}21812{_}1579.
10136-8{_}21813{_}INGREDIENTS.--Pineapple, sugar, water.
10136-8{_}21814{_}_Mode_.--Cut the pine into slices 1/4 inch in thickness; peel them, and remove the hard part from the middle.
10136-8{_}21815{_}Put the parings and hard pieces into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and boil for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}21816{_}Strain the liquor, and put in the slices of pine.
10136-8{_}21817{_}Stew them for 10 minutes, add sufficient sugar to sweeten the whole nicely, and boil again for another 1/4 hour; skim well, and the preserve will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}21818{_}It must be eaten soon, as it will keep but a very short time.
10136-8{_}21819{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the parings in water; 10 minutes to boil the pine without sugar, 1/4 hour with sugar.
10136-8{_}21820{_}_Average cost_.--Foreign pines, 1s.
10136-8{_}21821{_}to 3s.

10136-8{_}21826{_}PLUM JAM.
10136-8{_}21827{_}1580.
10136-8{_}21828{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}21829{_}of plums, weighed before being stoned, allow 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21830{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21831{_}_Mode_.--In making plum jam, the quantity of sugar for each lb.
10136-8{_}21832{_}of fruit must be regulated by the quality and size of the fruit, some plums requiring much more sugar than others.
10136-8{_}21833{_}Divide the plums, take out the stones, and put them on to large dishes, with roughly-pounded sugar sprinkled over them in the above proportion, and let them remain for one day; then put them into a preserving-pan, stand them by the side of the fire to simmer gently for about 1/2 hour, and then boil them rapidly for another 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}21834{_}The scum must be carefully removed as it rises, and the jam must be well stirred all the time, or it will burn at the bottom of the pan, and so spoil the colour and flavour of the preserve.
10136-8{_}21835{_}Some of the stones may be cracked, and a few kernels added to the jam just before it is done: these impart a very delicious flavour to the plums.
10136-8{_}21836{_}The above proportion of sugar would answer for Orleans plums; the Impératrice Magnum-bonum, and Winesour would not require quite so much.
10136-8{_}21837{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour to simmer gently, 1/4 hour to boil rapidly.
10136-8{_}21838{_}_Best plums for preserving_.--Violets, Mussels, Orleans, Impératrice Magnum-bonum, and Winesour.
10136-8{_}21839{_}_Seasonable_ from the end of July to the beginning of October.
10136-8{_}21840{_}PLUMS.--The Damson, or Damascene plum, takes its name from     Damascus, where it grows in great quantities, and whence it was     brought into Italy about 114 B.C.
10136-8{_}21841{_}The Orleans plum is from     France.
10136-8{_}21842{_}The Greengage is called after the Gage family, who first     brought it into England from the monastery of the Chartreuse, at     Paris, where it still bears the name of Reine Claude.
10136-8{_}21843{_}The     Magnum-bonum is our largest plum, and greatly esteemed for     preserves and culinary purposes.
10136-8{_}21844{_}The best sorts of plums are     agreeable at the dessert, and, when perfectly ripe, are     wholesome; but some are too astringent.
10136-8{_}21845{_}They lose much of their     bad qualities by baking, and are extensively used, from their     cheapness, when in full season, in tarts and preserves; but they     are not a very wholesome fruit, and should be eaten in     moderation.
10136-8{_}21846{_}PRESERVED PLUMS.
10136-8{_}21847{_}1581.
10136-8{_}21848{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}21849{_}of fruit allow 3/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21850{_}of loaf sugar; for the thin syrup, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}21851{_}of sugar to each pint of water.
10136-8{_}21852{_}_Mode_.--Select large ripe plums; slightly prick them, to prevent them from bursting, and simmer them very gently in a syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water.
10136-8{_}21853{_}Put them carefully into a pan, let the syrup cool, pour it over the plums, and allow them to remain for two days.
10136-8{_}21854{_}Having previously weighed the other sugar, dip the lumps quickly into water, and put them into a preserving-pan with no more water than hangs about them; and boil the sugar to a syrup, carefully skimming it.
10136-8{_}21855{_}Drain the plums from the first syrup; put them into the fresh syrup, and simmer them very gently until they are clear; lift them out singly into pots, pour the syrup over, and when cold, cover down to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}21856{_}This preserve will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place, and makes a very nice addition to a dessert.
10136-8{_}21857{_}The magnum-bonum plums answer for this preserve better than any other kind of plum.
10136-8{_}21858{_}Greengages are also very delicious done in this manner.
10136-8{_}21859{_}_Time_.--1/4 hour to 20 minutes to simmer the plums in the first syrup; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour very gentle simmering in the second.
10136-8{_}21860{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}21861{_}TO PRESERVE PLUMS DRY.
10136-8{_}21862{_}1582.
10136-8{_}21863{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}21864{_}of sugar allow 1/4 pint of water.
10136-8{_}21865{_}_Mode_.--Gather the plums when they are full-grown and just turning colour; prick them, put them into a saucepan of cold water, and set them on the fire until the water is on the point of boiling.
10136-8{_}21866{_}Then take them out, drain them, and boil them gently in syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water; and if the plums shrink, and will not take the sugar, prick them as they lie in the pan; give them another boil, skim, and set them by.
10136-8{_}21867{_}The next day add some more sugar, boiled almost to candy, to the fruit and syrup; put all together into a wide-mouthed jar, and place them in a cool oven for 2 nights; then drain the plums from the syrup, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over, and dry them in a cool oven.
10136-8{_}21868{_}_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes to boil the plums in the syrup.
10136-8{_}21869{_}_Seasonable_ from August to October.
10136-8{_}21870{_}PLUMS.--The wild sloe is the parent of the plum, but the     acclimated kinds come from the East.
10136-8{_}21871{_}The cultivation of this     fruit was probably attended to very early in England, as Gerrard     informs us that, in 1597, he had in his garden, in Holborn,     threescore sorts.
10136-8{_}21872{_}The sloe is a shrub common in our hedgerows,     and belongs to the natural order _Amygdaleae_; the fruit is     about the size of a large pea, of a black colour, and covered     with a bloom of a bright blue.
10136-8{_}21873{_}It is one of the few indigenous     to our island.
10136-8{_}21874{_}The juice is extremely sharp and astringent, and     was formerly employed as a medicine, where astringents were     necessary.
10136-8{_}21875{_}It now assists in the manufacture of a red wine made     to imitate port, and also for adulteration.
10136-8{_}21876{_}The leaves have been     used to adulterate tea; the fruit, when ripe, makes a good     preserve.
10136-8{_}21877{_}STEWED FRENCH PLUMS.

10136-8{_}21885{_}Arrange the plums on a glass dish, take out the lemon-rind, pour the syrup over the plums, and, when cold, they will be ready for table.
10136-8{_}21886{_}A little allspice stewed with the fruit is by many persons considered an improvement.
10136-8{_}21887{_}_Time_.--1 hour to stew the plums in water, 1-1/2 hour in the syrup.
10136-8{_}21888{_}_Average cost_,--plums sufficiently good for stewing, 1s.
10136-8{_}21889{_}per lb.

10136-8{_}21896{_}of roughly pounded loaf sugar, 1 gill of lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}21897{_}_Mode_.--Obtain a good sweet pumpkin; halve it, take out the seeds, and pare off the rind; cut it into neat slices, or into pieces about the size of a five-shilling piece.
10136-8{_}21898{_}Weigh the pumpkin, put the slices in a pan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled between them; pour the lemon-juice over the top, and let the whole remain for 2 or 3 days.
10136-8{_}21899{_}Boil altogether, adding 1/4 pint of water to every 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}21900{_}of sugar used until the pumpkin becomes tender; then turn the whole into a pan, where let it remain for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it until it is quite thick; skim, and pour it, boiling, over the pumpkin.
10136-8{_}21901{_}A little bruised ginger and lemon-rind, thinly pared, may be boiled in the syrup to flavour the pumpkin.
10136-8{_}21902{_}_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the pumpkin tender.
10136-8{_}21903{_}_Average cost_, 5d.
10136-8{_}21904{_}to 7d.
10136-8{_}21905{_}per lb.
10136-8{_}21906{_}pot.
10136-8{_}21907{_}_Seasonable_ in September and October; but better when made in the latter month, as the pumpkin is then quite ripe.
10136-8{_}21908{_}_Note_.--Vegetable marrows are very good prepared in the same manner, but are not quite so rich.
10136-8{_}21909{_}QUINCE JELLY.

10136-8{_}21914{_}Boil them until tender, and the fruit is reduced to a pulp; strain off the clear juice, and to each pint allow the above proportion of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21915{_}Boil the juice and sugar together for about 3/4 hour; remove all the scum as it rises, and, when the jelly appears firm when a little is poured on a plate, it is done.
10136-8{_}21916{_}The residue left on the sieve will answer to make a common marmalade, for immediate use, by boiling it with 1/2 lb.

10136-8{_}21929{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}21930{_}_Mode_.--Slice the quinces into a preserving-pan, adding sufficient water for them to float; place them on the fire to stew, until reduced to a pulp, keeping them stirred occasionally from the bottom, to prevent their burning; then pass the pulp through a hair sieve, to keep back the skin and seeds.
10136-8{_}21931{_}Weigh the pulp, and to each lb.
10136-8{_}21932{_}add lump sugar in the above proportion, broken very small.
10136-8{_}21933{_}Place the whole on the fire, and keep it well stirred from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until reduced to a marmalade, which may be known by dropping a little on a cold plate, when, if it jellies, it is done.

10136-8{_}22023{_}They may be made of strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any of these fruits mixed; peaches also make a very good salad.
10136-8{_}22024{_}After the sugar is sprinkled over, about 6 large tablespoonfuls of wine or brandy, or 3 tablespoonfuls of liqueur, should be poured in the middle of the fruit; and, when the flavour is liked, a little pounded cinnamon may be added.

10136-8{_}22099{_}1598.
10136-8{_}22100{_}The tazza, or dish with stem, the same as that shown in our illustrations, is now the favourite shape for dessert-dishes.
10136-8{_}22101{_}The fruit can be arranged and shown to better advantage on these tall high dishes than on the short flat ones.
10136-8{_}22102{_}All the dishes are now usually placed down the centre of the table, dried and fresh fruit alternately, the former being arranged on small round or oval glass plates, and the latter on the dishes with stems.
10136-8{_}22103{_}The fruit should always be gathered on the same day that it is required for table, and should be tastefully arranged on the dishes, with leaves between and round it.
10136-8{_}22104{_}By purchasing fruits that are in season, a dessert can be supplied at a very moderate cost.
10136-8{_}22105{_}These, with a few fancy biscuits, crystallized fruit, bon-bons, &c., are sufficient for an ordinary dessert.
10136-8{_}22106{_}When fresh fruit cannot be obtained, dried and foreign fruits, compotes, baked pears, stewed Normandy pippins, &c. &c., must supply its place, with the addition of preserves, bon-bons, cakes, biscuits, &c. At fashionable tables, forced fruit is served growing in pots, these pots being hidden in more ornamental ones, and arranged with the other dishes.--(See coloured plate W1.)
10136-8{_}22107{_}A few vases of fresh flowers, tastefully arranged, add very much to the appearance of the dessert; and, when these are not obtainable, a few paper ones, mixed with green leaves, answer very well as a substitute.
10136-8{_}22108{_}In decorating a table, whether for luncheon, dessert, or supper, a vase or two of flowers should never be forgotten, as they add so much to the elegance of the _tout ensemble_.
10136-8{_}22109{_}In summer and autumn, ladies residing in the country can always manage to have a few freshly-gathered flowers on their tables, and should never be without this inexpensive luxury.
10136-8{_}22110{_}On the continent, vases or epergnes filled with flowers are invariably placed down the centre of the dinner-table at regular distances.
10136-8{_}22111{_}Ices for dessert are usually moulded: when this is not the case, they are handed round in glasses with wafers to accompany them.
10136-8{_}22112{_}Preserved ginger is frequently handed round after ices, to prepare the palate for the delicious dessert wines.
10136-8{_}22113{_}A basin or glass of finely-pounded lump sugar must never be omitted at a dessert, as also a glass jug of fresh cold water (iced, if possible), and two goblets by its side.
10136-8{_}22114{_}Grape-scissors, a melon-knife and fork, and nutcrackers, should always be put on table, if there are dishes of fruit requiring them.
10136-8{_}22115{_}Zests are sometimes served at the close of the dessert; such as anchovy toasts or biscuits.
10136-8{_}22116{_}The French often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or dried fruit.
10136-8{_}22117{_}At some tables, finger-glasses are placed at the right of each person, nearly half filled with cold spring water, and in winter with tepid water.
10136-8{_}22118{_}These precede the dessert.
10136-8{_}22119{_}At other tables, a glass or vase is simply handed round, filled with perfumed water, into which each guest dips the corner of his napkin, and, when needful, refreshes his lips and the tips of his fingers.

10136-8{_}22124{_}After the dishes are placed, and every one is provided with plates, glasses, spoons, &c., the wine should be put at each end of the table, cooled or otherwise, according to the season.

10136-8{_}22128{_}These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish, as shown in the engraving, with or without leaves round the edge.
10136-8{_}22129{_}Filberts should always be served with the outer skin or husk on them; and walnuts should be well wiped with a damp cloth, and then--with a dry one, to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have.
10136-8{_}22130{_}_Seasonable_.--Filberts from September to March, good; may be had after that time, but are generally shrivelled and dry.
10136-8{_}22131{_}Walnuts from September to January.
10136-8{_}22132{_}HAZEL NUT AND FILBERT.--The common Hazel is the wild, and the     Filbert the cultivated state of the same tree.
10136-8{_}22133{_}The hazel is     found wild, not only in forests and hedges, in dingles and     ravines, but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and     mountainous parts of the country.
10136-8{_}22134{_}It was formerly one of the     most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this     island.
10136-8{_}22135{_}It is seldom cultivated as a fruit-tree, though perhaps     its nuts are superior in flavour to the others.
10136-8{_}22136{_}The Spanish nuts     imported are a superior kind, but they are somewhat oily and     rather indigestible.
10136-8{_}22137{_}Filberts, both the red and the white, and     the cob-nut, are supposed to be merely varieties of the common     hazel, which have been produced, partly by the superiority of     soil and climate, and partly by culture.
10136-8{_}22138{_}They were originally     brought out of Greece to Italy, whence they have found their way     to Holland, and from that country to England.
10136-8{_}22139{_}It is supposed     that, within a few miles of Maidstone, in Kent, there are more     filberts grown than in all England besides; and it is from that     place that the London market is supplied.
10136-8{_}22140{_}The filbert is longer     than the common nut, though of the same thickness, and has a     larger kernel.
10136-8{_}22141{_}The cob-nut is a still larger variety, and is     roundish.
10136-8{_}22142{_}Filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common     nuts, and are generally eaten with salt.
10136-8{_}22143{_}They are very free from     oil, and disagree with few persons.
10136-8{_}22144{_}WALNUTS.--The Walnut is a native of Persia, the Caucasus, and     China, but was introduced to this kingdom from France.
10136-8{_}22145{_}The ripe     kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable     flavour; and the fruit is also much used in the green state, but     before the stone hardens, as a pickle.
10136-8{_}22146{_}In Spain, grated walnuts     are employed in tarts and other dishes.
10136-8{_}22147{_}The Walnut abounds in     oil which is expressed and which, being of a highly drying     nature, and very limpid, is much employed for delicate painting.
10136-8{_}22148{_}This, on the continent, is sometimes used as a substitute for     olive-oil in cooking, but is very apt to turn rancid.
10136-8{_}22149{_}It is also     manufactured into a kind of soap.
10136-8{_}22150{_}The mare, or refuse matter     after the oil is extracted, proves very nutritious for poultry     or other domestic animals.
10136-8{_}22151{_}In Switzerland, this is eaten by poor     people under the name of _pain amer._  BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS.

10136-8{_}22153{_}If the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental, it may be placed on the table; if small, on a glass dish; if large, without one, French plums may also be arranged on a glass plate, and garnished with bright-coloured sweetmeats, which make a very good effect.
10136-8{_}22154{_}All fancy boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table or not, at pleasure.
10136-8{_}22155{_}These little matters of detail must, of course, be left to individual taste.
10136-8{_}22156{_}_Seasonable_.--May be purchased all the year; but are in greater perfection in the winter, and are more suitable for that season, as fresh fruit cannot be obtained.
10136-8{_}22157{_}DISH OF MIXED FRUIT.
10136-8{_}22158{_}1601.
10136-8{_}22159{_}For a centre dish, a mixture of various fresh fruits has a remarkably good effect, particularly if a pine be added to the list.
10136-8{_}22160{_}A high raised appearance should be given to the fruit, which is done in the following manner.
10136-8{_}22161{_}Place a tumbler in the centre of the dish, and, in this tumbler, the pine, crown uppermost; round the tumbler put a thick layer of moss, and, over this, apples, pears, plums, peaches, and such fruit as is simultaneously in season.
10136-8{_}22162{_}By putting a layer of moss underneath, so much fruit is not required, besides giving a better shape to the dish.
10136-8{_}22163{_}Grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit, a portion of some of the bunches hanging over the sides of the dish in a négligé kind of manner, which takes off the formal look of the dish.
10136-8{_}22164{_}In arranging the plums, apples, &c., let the colours contrast well.
10136-8{_}22165{_}_Seasonable_.--Suitable for a dessert in September or October.
10136-8{_}22166{_}GRAPES.--France produces about a thousand varieties of the     grape, which is cultivated more extensively in that country than     in any other.
10136-8{_}22167{_}Hygienists agree in pronouncing grapes as among     the best of fruits.
10136-8{_}22168{_}The grape possesses several rare qualities:     it is nourishing and fattening, and its prolonged use has often     overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation.
10136-8{_}22169{_}The skins and     pips of grapes should not be eaten.
10136-8{_}22170{_}BOX OF CHOCOLATE.
10136-8{_}22171{_}1602.
10136-8{_}22172{_}This is served in an ornamental box, placed on a glass plate or dish.
10136-8{_}22173{_}_Seasonable_.--May be purchased at any time.
10136-8{_}22174{_}DISH OF APPLES.
10136-8{_}22175{_}1603.
10136-8{_}22176{_}The apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth, and arranged on a dish, piled high in the centre, with evergreen leaves between each layer.
10136-8{_}22177{_}The inferior apples should form the bottom layer, with the bright-coloured large ones at the top.
10136-8{_}22178{_}The leaves of the laurel, bay, holly, or any shrub green in winter, are suitable for garnishing dessert dishes.
10136-8{_}22179{_}Oranges may be arranged in the same manner; they should also be wiped with a dry cloth before being sent to table.
10136-8{_}22180{_}DISH OF MIXED SUMMER FRUIT.
10136-8{_}22181{_}1604.
10136-8{_}22182{_}This dish consists of cherries, raspberries, currants, and strawberries, piled in different layers, with plenty of leaves between each layer; so that each fruit is well separated.
10136-8{_}22183{_}The fruit should be arranged with a due regard to colour, so that they contrast nicely one with the other.
10136-8{_}22184{_}Our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the bottom, then one of red raspberries; over that a layer of white currants, and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries.
10136-8{_}22185{_}_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.
10136-8{_}22186{_}ALMONDS AND RAISINS.
10136-8{_}22187{_}1605.
10136-8{_}22188{_}These are usually served on glass dishes, the fruit piled high in the centre, and the almonds blanched, and strewn over.
10136-8{_}22189{_}To blanch the almonds, put them into a small mug or teacup, pour over them boiling water, let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes, and the skins may then be easily removed.
10136-8{_}22190{_}Figs, dates, French plums, &c., are all served on small glass plates or oval dishes, but without the almonds.
10136-8{_}22191{_}_Seasonable_ at any time, but more suitable in winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable.
10136-8{_}22192{_}DATES.--Dates are imported into Britain, in a dried state, from     Barbary and Egypt, and, when in good condition, they are much     esteemed.
10136-8{_}22193{_}An inferior kind has lately become common, which are     dried hard, and have little or no flavour.
10136-8{_}22194{_}They should be chosen     large, softish, not much wrinkled, of a reddish-yellow colour on     the outside, with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the     stone.
10136-8{_}22195{_}DISH OF STRAWBERRIES.
10136-8{_}22196{_}1606.
10136-8{_}22197{_}Fine strawberries, arranged in the manner shown in the engraving, look exceedingly well.
10136-8{_}22198{_}The inferior ones should be placed at the bottom of the dish, and the others put in rows pyramidically, with the stalks downwards; so that when the whole is completed, nothing but the red part of the fruit is visible.
10136-8{_}22199{_}The fruit should be gathered with rather long stalks, as there is then something to support it, and it can be placed more upright in each layer.
10136-8{_}22200{_}A few of the finest should be reserved to crown the top.
10136-8{_}22201{_}TO HAVE WALNUTS FRESH THROUGHOUT THE SEASON.
10136-8{_}22202{_}1607.
10136-8{_}22203{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of water allow 1 teaspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}22204{_}_Mode_.--Place the walnuts in the salt and water for 24 hours at least; then take them out, and rub them dry.
10136-8{_}22205{_}Old nuts may be freshened in this manner; or walnuts, when first picked, may be put into an earthen pan with salt sprinkled amongst them, and with damped hay placed on the top of them, and then covered down with a lid.
10136-8{_}22206{_}They must be well wiped before they are put on table.
10136-8{_}22207{_}_Seasonable_.--Should be stored away in September or October.

10136-8{_}22209{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.
10136-8{_}22210{_}MILK.
10136-8{_}22211{_}1608.
10136-8{_}22212{_}Milk is obtained only from the class of animals called Mammalia, and is intended by Nature for the nourishment of their young.
10136-8{_}22213{_}The milk of each animal is distinguished by some peculiarities; but as that of the cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world, our observations will be confined to that variety.
10136-8{_}22214{_}1609.
10136-8{_}22215{_}Milk, when drawn from the cow, is of a yellowish-white colour, and is the most yellow at the beginning of the period of lactation.
10136-8{_}22216{_}Its taste is agreeable, and rather saccharine.
10136-8{_}22217{_}The viscidity and specific gravity of milk are somewhat greater than that of water; but these properties vary somewhat in the milk procured from different individuals.
10136-8{_}22218{_}On an average, the specific gravity of milk is 1.035, water being 1.
10136-8{_}22219{_}The small cows of the Alderney breed afford the richest milk.
10136-8{_}22220{_}1610.
10136-8{_}22221{_}Milk which is carried to a considerable distance, so as to be much agitated, and cooled before it is put into pans to settle for cream, never throws up so much, nor such rich cream, as if the same milk had been put into pans directly after it was milked.
10136-8{_}22222{_}1611.
10136-8{_}22223{_}Milk, considered as an aliment, is of such importance in domestic economy as to render all the improvements in its production extremely valuable.
10136-8{_}22224{_}To enlarge upon the antiquity of its use is unnecessary; it has always been a favourite food in Britain.
10136-8{_}22225{_}"Lacte et carno vivunt," says Caesar, in his Commentaries; the English of which is, "the inhabitants subsist upon flesh and milk."
10136-8{_}22226{_}The breed of the cow has received great improvement in modern times, as regards the quantity and quality of the milk which she affords; the form of milch-cows, their mode of nourishment, and progress, are also manifest in the management of the dairy.
10136-8{_}22227{_}1612.
10136-8{_}22228{_}Although milk in its natural state be a fluid, yet, considered as an aliment, it is both solid and fluid: for no sooner does it enter the stomach, than it is coagulated by the gastric juice, and separated into curd and whey, the first of these being extremely nutritive.
10136-8{_}22229{_}1613.
10136-8{_}22230{_}Milk of the _human subject_ is much thinner than cow's milk; _Ass's milk_ comes the nearest to human milk of any other; _Goat's milk_ is something thicker and richer than cow's milk; _Ewe's milk_ has the appearance of cow's milk, and affords a larger quantity of cream; _Mare's milk_ contains more sugar than that of the ewe; _Camel's milk_ is used only in Africa; _Buffalo's milk_ is employed in India.
10136-8{_}22231{_}1614.
10136-8{_}22232{_}From no other substance, solid or fluid, can so great a number of distinct kinds of aliment be prepared as from milk; some forming food, others drink; some of them delicious, and deserving the name of luxuries; all of them wholesome, and some medicinal: indeed, the variety of aliments that seems capable of being produced from milk, appears to be quite endless.
10136-8{_}22233{_}In every age this must have been a subject for experiment, and every nation has added to the number by the invention of some peculiarity of its own.
10136-8{_}22234{_}BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22235{_}1615.
10136-8{_}22236{_}BECKMAN, in his "History of Inventions," states that butter was not used either by the Greeks or Romans in cooking, nor was it brought upon their tables at certain meals, as is the custom at present.
10136-8{_}22237{_}In England it has been made from time immemorial, though the art of making cheese is said not to have been known to the ancient Britons, and to have been learned from their conquerors.
10136-8{_}22238{_}1616.
10136-8{_}22239{_}The taste of butter is peculiar, and very unlike any other fatty substance.
10136-8{_}22240{_}It is extremely agreeable when of the best quality; but its flavour depends much upon the food given to the cows: to be good, it should not adhere to the knife.
10136-8{_}22241{_}1617.
10136-8{_}22242{_}Butter, with regard to its dietetic properties, may be regarded nearly in the light of vegetable oils and animal fats; but it becomes sooner rancid than most other fat oils.
10136-8{_}22243{_}When fresh, it cannot but be considered as very wholesome; but it should be quite free from rancidity.
10136-8{_}22244{_}If slightly salted when it is fresh, its wholesomeness is probably not at all impaired; but should it begin to turn rancid, salting will not correct its unwholesomeness.
10136-8{_}22245{_}When salt butter is put into casks, the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid, and this rancidity is also liable to affect the whole cask.
10136-8{_}22246{_}1618.
10136-8{_}22247{_}_Epping butter_ is the kind most esteemed in London.
10136-8{_}22248{_}_Fresh butter_ comes to London from Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Yorkshire, Devonshire, &c. _Cambridge butter_ is esteemed next to fresh; _Devonshire butter_ is nearly similar in quality to the latter; _Irish butter_ sold in London is all salted, but is generally good.
10136-8{_}22249{_}The number of firkins exported annually from Ireland amounts to 420,000, equal to a million of money.
10136-8{_}22250{_}_Dutch butter_ is in good repute all over Europe, America, and even India; and no country in the world is so successful in the manufacture of this article, Holland supplying more butter to the rest of the world than any country whatever.
10136-8{_}22251{_}1619.
10136-8{_}22252{_}There are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter.
10136-8{_}22253{_}In one, the cream is separated from the milk, and in that state it is converted into butter by churning, as is the practice about Epping; in the other, milk is subjected to the same process, which is the method usually followed in Cheshire.
10136-8{_}22254{_}The first method is generally said to give the richest butter, and the latter the largest quantity, though some are of opinion that there is little difference either in quality or quantity.
10136-8{_}22255{_}CHEESE.
10136-8{_}22256{_}1620.
10136-8{_}22257{_}CHEESE is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation, pressed and dried for use.
10136-8{_}22258{_}Curd, called also casein and caseous matter, or the basis of cheese, exists in the milk, and not in the cream, and requires only to be separated by coagulation.
10136-8{_}22259{_}The coagulation, however, supposes some alteration of the curd.
10136-8{_}22260{_}By means of the substance employed to coagulate it, it is rendered insoluble in water.
10136-8{_}22261{_}When the curd is freed from the whey, kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely, it becomes cheese.
10136-8{_}22262{_}This assumes a degree of transparency, and possesses many of the properties of coagulated albumen.
10136-8{_}22263{_}If it be well dried, it does not change by exposure to the air; but if it contain moisture, it soon putrefies.
10136-8{_}22264{_}It therefore requires some salt to preserve it, and this acts likewise as a kind of seasoning.
10136-8{_}22265{_}All our cheese is coloured more or less, except that made from skim milk.
10136-8{_}22266{_}The colouring substances employed are arnatto, turmeric, or marigold, all perfectly harmless unless they are adulterated; and it is said that arnatto sometimes contains red lead.
10136-8{_}22267{_}1621.
10136-8{_}22268{_}Cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials of which it is composed.
10136-8{_}22269{_}It is made--1.
10136-8{_}22270{_}Of entire milk, as in Cheshire; 2. of milk and cream, as at Stilton; 3. of new milk mixed with skimmed milk, as in Gloucestershire; 4. of skimmed milk only, as in Suffolk, Holland, and Italy.
10136-8{_}22271{_}1622.
10136-8{_}22272{_}The principal varieties of cheese used in England are the following:--_Cheshire cheese_, famed all over Europe for its rich quality and fine piquant flavour.
10136-8{_}22273{_}It is made of entire new milk, the cream not being taken off.
10136-8{_}22274{_}_Gloucester cheese_ is much milder in its taste than the Cheshire.
10136-8{_}22275{_}There are two kinds of Gloucester cheese,--single and double.
10136-8{_}22276{_}_Single Gloucester_ is made of skimmed milk, or of the milk deprived of half the cream; _Double Gloucester_ is a cheese that pleases almost every palate: it is made of the whole milk and cream.
10136-8{_}22277{_}_Stilton cheese_ is made by adding the cream of one day to the entire milk of the next: it was first made at Stilton, in Leicestershire.
10136-8{_}22278{_}_Sage cheese_ is so called from the practice of colouring some curd with bruised sage, marigold-leaves, and parsley, and mixing this with some uncoloured curd.
10136-8{_}22279{_}With the Romans, and during the middle ages, this practice was extensively adopted.
10136-8{_}22280{_}_Cheddar cheese_ much resembles Parmesan.
10136-8{_}22281{_}It has a very agreeable taste and flavour, and has a spongy appearance.
10136-8{_}22282{_}_Brickbat cheese_ has nothing remarkable except its form.
10136-8{_}22283{_}It is made by turning with rennet a mixture of cream and new milk.
10136-8{_}22284{_}The curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick, and is then pressed and dried in the usual way.
10136-8{_}22285{_}_Dunlop cheese_ has a peculiarly mild and rich taste: the best is made entirely from new milk.
10136-8{_}22286{_}_New cheese_ (as it is called in London) is made chiefly in Lincolnshire, and is either made of all cream, or, like Stilton.
10136-8{_}22287{_}by adding the cream of one day's milking to the milk that comes immediately from the cow: they are extremely thin, and are compressed gently two or three times, turned for a few days, and then eaten new with radishes, salad, &c. _Skimmed Milk cheese_ is made for sea voyages principally.
10136-8{_}22288{_}_Parmesan cheese_ is made in Parma and Piacenza.
10136-8{_}22289{_}It is the most celebrated of all cheese: it is made entirely of skimmed cow's milk.
10136-8{_}22290{_}The high flavour which it has, is supposed to be owing to the rich herbage of the meadows of the Po, where the cows are pastured.
10136-8{_}22291{_}The best Parmesan is kept for three or four years, and none is carried to market till it is at least six months old.
10136-8{_}22292{_}_Dutch cheese_ derives its peculiar pungent taste from the practice adopted in Holland of coagulating the milk with muriatic acid instead of rennet.
10136-8{_}22293{_}_Swiss cheeses_ in their several varieties are all remarkable for their fine flavour.
10136-8{_}22294{_}That from _Gruyère_, a bailiwick in the canton of Fribourg, is best known in England.
10136-8{_}22295{_}It is flavoured by the dried herb of _Melilotos officinalis_ in powder.
10136-8{_}22296{_}Cheese from milk and potatoes is manufactured in Thuringia and Saxony.
10136-8{_}22297{_}_Cream cheese_, although so called, is not properly cheese, but is nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to be cut with a knife.
10136-8{_}22298{_}EGGS.
10136-8{_}22299{_}1623.
10136-8{_}22300{_}There is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs, although the qualities of those belonging to different birds vary somewhat.
10136-8{_}22301{_}Those of the common hen are most esteemed as delicate food, particularly when "new-laid."
10136-8{_}22302{_}The quality of eggs depends much upon the food given to the hen.
10136-8{_}22303{_}Eggs in general are considered most easily digestible when little subjected to the art of cookery.
10136-8{_}22304{_}The lightest way of dressing them is by poaching, which is effected by putting them for a minute or two into brisk boiling water: this coagulates the external white, without doing the inner part too much.
10136-8{_}22305{_}Eggs are much better when new-laid than a day or two afterwards.
10136-8{_}22306{_}The usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 3-3/4 minutes: less time than that in boiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white, and more will make the yolk hard and less digestible: it is very difficult to _guess_ accurately as to the time.
10136-8{_}22307{_}Great care should be employed in putting them into the water, to prevent cracking the shell, which inevitably causes a portion of the white to exude, and lets water into the egg.
10136-8{_}22308{_}Eggs are often beaten up raw in nutritive beverages.
10136-8{_}22309{_}1624.
10136-8{_}22310{_}Eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery, entrées, and entremets, and they form an essential ingredient in pastry, creams, flip, &c. It is particularly necessary that they should be quite fresh, as nothing is worse than stale eggs.
10136-8{_}22311{_}Cobbett justly says, stale, or even preserved eggs, are things to be run from, not after.
10136-8{_}22312{_}1625.
10136-8{_}22313{_}The Metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the kingdom, and they are likewise largely imported from various places on the continent; as France, Holland, Belgium, Guernsey, and Jersey.
10136-8{_}22314{_}It appears from official statements mentioned in McCulloch's "Commercial Dictionary," that the number imported from France alone amounts to about 60,000,000 a year; and supposing them on an average to cost fourpence a dozen, it follows that we pay our continental neighbours above £83,000 a year for eggs.
10136-8{_}22315{_}1626.
10136-8{_}22316{_}The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour.
10136-8{_}22317{_}Those of the ostrich are the largest: one laid in the menagerie in Paris weighed 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}22318{_}14 oz., held a pint, and was six inches deep: this is about the usual size of those brought from Africa.
10136-8{_}22319{_}Travellers describe _ostrich eggs_ as of an agreeable taste: they keep longer than hen's eggs.
10136-8{_}22320{_}Drinking-cups are often made of the shell, which is very strong.
10136-8{_}22321{_}The eggs of the _turkey_ are almost as mild as those of the hen; the egg of the _goose_ is large, but well-tasted.
10136-8{_}22322{_}_Duck's eggs_ have a rich flavour; the albumen is slightly transparent, or bluish, when set or coagulated by boiling, which requires less time than hen's eggs.
10136-8{_}22323{_}_Guinea-fowl eggs_ are smaller and more delicate than those of the hen.
10136-8{_}22324{_}Eggs of _wild fowl_ are generally coloured, often spotted; and the taste generally partakes somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to.
10136-8{_}22325{_}Those of land birds that are eaten, as the _plover, lapwing, ruff_, &c., are in general much esteemed; but those of _sea-fowl_ have, more or less, a strong fishy taste.
10136-8{_}22326{_}The eggs of the _turtle_ are very numerous: they consist of yolk only, without shell, and are delicious.
10136-8{_}22327{_}RECIPES.
10136-8{_}22328{_}CHAPTER XXXIII.
10136-8{_}22329{_}SEPARATION OF MILK AND CREAM.
10136-8{_}22330{_}1627.
10136-8{_}22331{_}If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream, it should be poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish, not more than 1-1/2 inch deep, as cream cannot rise through a great depth of milk.
10136-8{_}22332{_}In cold and wet weather, milk is not so rich as it is in summer and warm weather, and the morning's milk is always richer than the evening's.
10136-8{_}22333{_}The last-drawn milk of each milking, at all times and seasons, is richer than the first-drawn, and on that account should be set apart for cream.
10136-8{_}22334{_}Milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried from the cow to the dairy, and should be poured into the pans very gently.
10136-8{_}22335{_}Persons not keeping cows, may always have a little cream, provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated.
10136-8{_}22336{_}As soon as it comes in, it should be poured into very shallow open pie-dishes, and set by in a very cool place, and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface.
10136-8{_}22337{_}MILK is one of the most complete of all articles of food: that     is to say, it contains a very large number of the elements which     enter into the composition of the human body.
10136-8{_}22338{_}It "disagrees"     with fat, heavy, languid people, of slow circulation; and, at     first, with many people of sedentary habits, and stomachs     weakened by stimulants of different kinds.
10136-8{_}22339{_}But, if exercise can     be taken and a little patience shown, while the system     accommodates itself to a new regimen, this bland and soothing     article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin, nervous     people; especially for those who have suffered much from     emotional disturbances, or have relaxed their stomachs by too     much tea or coffee, taken too hot.
10136-8{_}22340{_}Milk is, in fact, a nutrient     and a sedative at once.
10136-8{_}22341{_}Stomachs, however, have their     idiosyncrasies, and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and     ill-digested article of food.
10136-8{_}22342{_}As milk, when good, contains a     good deal of respiratory material (fat),--material which _must_     either be burnt off, or derange the liver, and be rejected in     other ways, it may disagree because the lungs are not     sufficiently used in the open air.
10136-8{_}22343{_}But it is very probable that     there are really "constitutions" which cannot take to it; and     _they_ should not be forced.
10136-8{_}22344{_}TO KEEP MILK AND CREAM IN HOT WEATHER.
10136-8{_}22345{_}1628.
10136-8{_}22346{_}When the weather is very warm, and it is very difficult to prevent milk from turning sour and spoiling the cream, it should be scalded, and it will then remain good for a few hours.
10136-8{_}22347{_}It must on no account be allowed to boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk; and the slower the process, the safer will it be.
10136-8{_}22348{_}A very good plan to scald milk, is to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or wide kettle of boiling water.
10136-8{_}22349{_}When the surface looks thick, the milk is sufficiently scalded, and it should then be put away in a cool place in the same vessel that it was scalded in.
10136-8{_}22350{_}Cream may be kept for 24 hours, if scalded without sugar; and by the addition of the latter ingredient, it will remain good double the time, if kept in a cool place.
10136-8{_}22351{_}All pans, jugs, and vessels intended for milk, should be kept beautifully clean, and well scalded before the milk is put in, as any negligence in this respect may cause large quantities of it to be spoiled; and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper.
10136-8{_}22352{_}Milk may be preserved good in hot weather, for a few hours, by placing the jug which contains it in ice, or very cold water; or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid.
10136-8{_}22353{_}MILK, when of good quality, is of an opaque white colour: the     cream always comes to the top; the well-known milky odour is     strong; it will boil without altering its appearance, in these     respects; the little bladders which arise on the surface will     renew themselves if broken by the spoon.
10136-8{_}22354{_}To boil milk is, in     fact, the simplest way of testing its quality.
10136-8{_}22355{_}The commonest     adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character.
10136-8{_}22356{_}It is a     good deal thinned with water, and sometimes thickened with a     little starch, or colored with yolk of egg, or even saffron; but     these processes have nothing murderous in them.
10136-8{_}22357{_}CURDS AND WHEY.
10136-8{_}22358{_}1629.
10136-8{_}22359{_}INGREDIENTS.--A very small piece of rennet, 1/2 gallon of milk.
10136-8{_}22360{_}_Mode_.--Procure from the butcher's a small piece of rennet, which is the stomach of the calf, taken as soon as it is killed, scoured, and well rubbed with salt, and stretched on sticks to dry.
10136-8{_}22361{_}Pour some boiling water on the rennet, and let it remain for 6 hours; then use the liquor to turn the milk.
10136-8{_}22362{_}The milk should be warm and fresh from the cow: if allowed to cool, it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to new milk; but do not let it be too hot.
10136-8{_}22363{_}About a tablespoonful or rather more, would be sufficient to turn the above proportion of milk into curds and whey; and whilst the milk is turning, let it be kept in rather a warm place.
10136-8{_}22364{_}_Time_.--From 2 to 3 hours to turn the milk.
10136-8{_}22365{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22366{_}DEVONSHIRE CREAM.
10136-8{_}22367{_}1630.
10136-8{_}22368{_}The milk should stand 24 hours in the winter, half that time when the weather is very warm.
10136-8{_}22369{_}The milkpan is then set on a stove, and should there remain until the milk is quite hot; but it must not boil, or there will be a thick skin on the surface.
10136-8{_}22370{_}When it is sufficiently done, the undulations on the surface look thick, and small rings appear.
10136-8{_}22371{_}The time required for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; but the slower it is done, the better.
10136-8{_}22372{_}The pan should be placed in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently scalded, and skimmed the following day.
10136-8{_}22373{_}This cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the London markets in small square tins, and is exceedingly delicious eaten with fresh fruit.
10136-8{_}22374{_}In Devonshire, butter is made from this cream, and is usually very firm.
10136-8{_}22375{_}DEVONSHIRE JUNKET.
10136-8{_}22376{_}1631.
10136-8{_}22377{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of new milk allow 2 dessertspoonfuls of brandy, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, and 1-1/2 dessertspoonful of prepared rennet; thick cream, pounded cinnamon, or grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}22378{_}_Mode_.--Make the milk blood-warm; put it into a deep dish with the brandy, sugar, and rennet; stir it altogether, and cover it over until it is set.
10136-8{_}22379{_}Then spread some thick or clotted cream over the top, grate some nutmeg, and strew some sugar over, and the dish will be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}22380{_}_Time_.--About 2 hours to set the milk.
10136-8{_}22381{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22382{_}TO KEEP AND CHOOSE FRESH BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22383{_}1632.
10136-8{_}22384{_}Fresh butter should be kept in a dark, cool place, and in as large a mass as possible.
10136-8{_}22385{_}Mould as much only as is required, as the more surface is exposed, the more liability there will be to spoil; and the outside very soon becomes rancid.
10136-8{_}22386{_}Fresh butter should be kept covered with white paper.
10136-8{_}22387{_}For small larders, butter-coolers of red brick are now very much used for keeping fresh butter in warm weather.
10136-8{_}22388{_}These coolers are made with a large bell-shaped cover, into the top of which a little cold water should be poured, and in summer time very frequently changed; and the butter must be kept covered.
10136-8{_}22389{_}These coolers keep butter remarkably firm in hot weather, and are extremely convenient for those whose larder accommodation is limited.
10136-8{_}22390{_}[Illustration: BUTTER-DISH.]
10136-8{_}22391{_}In choosing fresh butter, remember it should smell deliciously, and be of an equal colour all through: if it smells sour, it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk; and if veiny and open, it has probably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort.
10136-8{_}22392{_}TO PRESERVE AND TO CHOOSE SALT BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22393{_}1633.
10136-8{_}22394{_}In large families, where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time, the first thing to be done is to turn the whole of the butter out, and, with a clean knife, to scrape the outside; the tub should then be wiped with a clean cloth, and sprinkled all round with salt, the butter replaced, and the lid kept on to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}22395{_}It is necessary to take these precautions, as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid, and if the scraping be neglected, the whole mass would soon become spoiled.
10136-8{_}22396{_}To choose salt butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the blade smells rancid or unpleasant, the butter is bad.
10136-8{_}22397{_}The layers in tubs will vary greatly, the butter being made at different times; so, to try if the whole tub be good, the cask should be unhooped, and the butter tried between the staves.
10136-8{_}22398{_}It is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream, or from unskimmed milk, by the churn.
10136-8{_}22399{_}Of course it partakes of the qualities of the milk, and winter butter is said not to be so good as spring butter.
10136-8{_}22400{_}A word of caution is necessary about _rancid_ butter.
10136-8{_}22401{_}Nobody eats it on bread, but it is sometimes used in cooking, in forms in which the acidity can be more or less disguised.
10136-8{_}22402{_}So much the worse; it is almost poisonous, disguise it as you may.
10136-8{_}22403{_}Never, under any exigency whatever, be tempted into allowing butter with even a _soupçon_ of "turning" to enter into the composition of any dish that appears on your table.
10136-8{_}22404{_}And, in general, the more you can do without the employment of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat, the better.
10136-8{_}22405{_}The woman of modern times is not a "leech;" but she might often keep the "leech" from the door, if she would give herself the trouble to invent _innocent_ sauces.
10136-8{_}22406{_}BUTTER-MOULDS, for Moulding Fresh Butter.
10136-8{_}22407{_}[Illustration: DISH OF ROLLED BUTTER.]
10136-8{_}22408{_}1634.
10136-8{_}22409{_}Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter, are much used, and are made in a variety of forms and shapes.
10136-8{_}22410{_}In using them, let them be kept scrupulously clean, and before the butter is pressed in, the interior should be well wetted with cold water; the butter must then be pressed in, the mould opened, and the perfect shape taken out.
10136-8{_}22411{_}The butter may be then dished, and garnished with a wreath of parsley, if for a cheese course; if for breakfast, put it into an ornamental butter-dish, with a little water at the bottom, should the weather be very warm.
10136-8{_}22412{_}CURLED BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22413{_}1635.
10136-8{_}22414{_}Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the wall; make a knot with the other two ends, so that a stick might pass through.
10136-8{_}22415{_}Put the butter into the cloth; twist it tightly over a dish, into which the butter will fall through the knot, so forming small and pretty little strings.
10136-8{_}22416{_}The butter may then be garnished with parsley, if to serve with a cheese course; or it may be sent to table plain for breakfast, in an ornamental dish.
10136-8{_}22417{_}Squirted butter for garnishing hams, salads, eggs, &c., is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in the shape of a cornet, and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the hole at the bottom.
10136-8{_}22418{_}Scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or scooper in warm water, and then scooping the butter quickly and thin.
10136-8{_}22419{_}In warm weather, it would not be necessary to heat the spoon.
10136-8{_}22420{_}BUTTER may be kept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple     process.
10136-8{_}22421{_}Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is     extracted; then put it in a glazed jar, which invert in another,     putting into the latter a sufficient quantity of water to     exclude the air.
10136-8{_}22422{_}Renew the water every day.
10136-8{_}22423{_}FAIRY BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22424{_}1636.
10136-8{_}22425{_}INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 tablespoonful of orange-flower water, 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22426{_}of good fresh butter.
10136-8{_}22427{_}_Mode_.--Beat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar, with the orange-flower water and the sugar, until the whole is reduced to a fine paste; add the butter, and force all through an old but clean cloth by wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard.
10136-8{_}22428{_}The butter will then drop on the plate in large and small pieces, according to the holes in the cloth.
10136-8{_}22429{_}Plain butter may be done in the same manner, and is very quickly prepared, besides having a very good effect.
10136-8{_}22430{_}BUTTER.--White-coloured butter is said not to be so good as the     yellow; but the yellow colour is often artificially produced, by     the introduction of colouring matter into the churn.
10136-8{_}22431{_}ANCHOVY BUTTER.
10136-8{_}22432{_}1637.
10136-8{_}22433{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}22434{_}of butter allow 6 anchovies, 1 small bunch of parsley.
10136-8{_}22435{_}_Mode_.--Wash, bone, and pound the anchovies well in a mortar; scald the parsley, chop it, and rub through a sieve; then pound all the ingredients together, mix well, and make the butter into pats immediately.
10136-8{_}22436{_}This makes a pretty dish, if fancifully moulded, for breakfast or supper, and should be garnished with parsley.
10136-8{_}22437{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}22438{_}8d.
10136-8{_}22439{_}_Sufficient_ to make 2 dishes, with 4 pats each.
10136-8{_}22440{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22441{_}CHEESE.
10136-8{_}22442{_}1638.
10136-8{_}22443{_}In families where much cheese is consumed, and it is bought in large quantities, a piece from the whole cheese should be cut, the larger quantity spread with a thickly-buttered sheet of white paper, and the outside occasionally wiped.
10136-8{_}22444{_}To keep cheeses moist that are in daily use, when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them, and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it, in a cool but not very dry place.
10136-8{_}22445{_}To ripen cheeses, and bring them forward, put them into a damp cellar; and, to check too large a production of mites, spirits may be poured into the parts affected.
10136-8{_}22446{_}Pieces of cheese which are too near the rind, or too dry to put on table, may be made into Welsh rare-bits, or grated down and mixed with macaroni.
10136-8{_}22447{_}Cheeses may be preserved in a perfect state for years, by covering them with parchment made pliable by soaking in water, or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat.
10136-8{_}22448{_}The cheeses selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind.
10136-8{_}22449{_}CHEESE.--It is well known that some persons like cheese in a     state of decay, and even "alive."
10136-8{_}22450{_}There is no accounting for     tastes, and it maybe hard to show why mould, which is     vegetation, should not be eaten as well as salad, or maggots as     well as eels.
10136-8{_}22451{_}But, generally speaking, decomposing bodies are     not wholesome eating, and the line must be drawn somewhere.
10136-8{_}22452{_}STILTON CHEESE.
10136-8{_}22453{_}[Illustration: STILTON CHEESE.]
10136-8{_}22454{_}1639.
10136-8{_}22455{_}Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as it is sometimes called, is generally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute.
10136-8{_}22456{_}Those made in May or June are usually served at Christmas; or, to be in prime order, should be kept from 10 to 12 months, or even longer.
10136-8{_}22457{_}An artificial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting a small piece of decayed Cheshire into an aperture at the top.
10136-8{_}22458{_}From 3 weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese.
10136-8{_}22459{_}An additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the top, and pouring therein port, sherry, Madeira, or old ale, and letting the cheese absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks.
10136-8{_}22460{_}But that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial aid, is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters.
10136-8{_}22461{_}In serving a Stilton cheese, the top of it should be cut off to form a lid, and a napkin or piece of white paper, with a frill at the top, pinned round.
10136-8{_}22462{_}When the cheese goes from table, the lid should be replaced.
10136-8{_}22463{_}MODE OF SERVING CHEESE.
10136-8{_}22464{_}[Illustration: CHEESE-GLASS.]
10136-8{_}22465{_}1640.
10136-8{_}22466{_}The usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small quantity of it into neat square pieces, and to put them into a glass cheese-dish, this dish being handed round.
10136-8{_}22467{_}Should the cheese crumble much, of course this method is rather wasteful, and it may then be put on the table in the piece, and the host may cut from it.
10136-8{_}22468{_}When served thus, the cheese must always be carefully scraped, and laid on a white d'oyley or napkin, neatly folded.
10136-8{_}22469{_}Cream cheese is often served in a cheese course, and, sometimes, grated Parmesan: the latter should he put into a covered glass dish.
10136-8{_}22470{_}Rusks, cheese-biscuits, pats or slices of butter, and salad, cucumber, or water-cresses, should always form part of a cheese course.
10136-8{_}22471{_}SMOKING CHEESES.--The Romans smoked their cheeses, to give them     a sharp taste.
10136-8{_}22472{_}They possessed public places expressly for this     use, and subject to police regulations which no one could evade.
10136-8{_}22473{_}A celebrated gourmand remarked that a dinner without cheese is     like a woman with one eye.
10136-8{_}22474{_}CHEESE SANDWICHES.
10136-8{_}22475{_}1641.
10136-8{_}22476{_}INGREDIENTS.--Slices of brown bread-and-butter, thin slices of cheese.
10136-8{_}22477{_}_Mode_.--Cut from a nice fat Cheshire, or any good rich cheese, some slices about 1/2 inch thick, and place them between some slices of brown bread-and-butter, like sandwiches.
10136-8{_}22478{_}Place them on a plate in the oven, and, when the bread is toasted, serve on a napkin very hot and very quickly.
10136-8{_}22479{_}_Time_.--10 minutes in a brisk oven.
10136-8{_}22480{_}_Average cost_, 1-1/2d.
10136-8{_}22481{_}each sandwich.
10136-8{_}22482{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a sandwich for each person.
10136-8{_}22483{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22484{_}CHEESE.--One of the most important products of coagulated milk     is cheese.
10136-8{_}22485{_}Unfermented, or cream-cheese, when quite fresh, is     good for subjects with whom milk does not disagree; but cheese,     in its commonest shape, is only fit for sedentary people as an     after-dinner stimulant, and in very small quantity.
10136-8{_}22486{_}Bread and     cheese, as a meal, is only fit for soldiers on march or     labourers in the open air, who like it because it "holds the     stomach a long time."
10136-8{_}22487{_}CAYENNE CHEESES.
10136-8{_}22488{_}1642.
10136-8{_}22489{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.

10136-8{_}22495{_}Moisten with sufficient water to make the whole into a paste; roll out, and cut into fingers about 4 inches in length.
10136-8{_}22496{_}Bake them in a moderate oven a very light colour, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}22497{_}_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes.

10136-8{_}22501{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22502{_}TO MAKE A FONDUE.
10136-8{_}22503{_}1643.
10136-8{_}22504{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, the weight of 2 in Parmesan or good Cheshire cheese, the weight of 2 in butter; pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}22505{_}_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former in a basin, and grate the cheese, or cut it into _very thin_ flakes.
10136-8{_}22506{_}Parmesan or Cheshire cheese may be used, whichever is the most convenient, although the former is considered more suitable for this dish; or an equal quantity of each may be used.
10136-8{_}22507{_}Break the butter into small pieces, add it to the other ingredients, with sufficient pepper and salt to season nicely, and beat the mixture thoroughly.
10136-8{_}22508{_}Well whisk the whites of the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either bake the fondue in a soufflé-dish or small round cake-tin.
10136-8{_}22509{_}Fill the dish only half full, as the fondue should rise very much.
10136-8{_}22510{_}Pin a napkin round the tin or dish, and serve very hot and very quickly.
10136-8{_}22511{_}If allowed to stand after it is withdrawn from the oven, the beauty and lightness of this preparation will be entirely spoiled.
10136-8{_}22512{_}_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes.

10136-8{_}22517{_}(_An excellent Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}22518{_}1644.
10136-8{_}22519{_}INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, cheese, butter, pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}22520{_}_Mode_.--Take the same number of eggs as there are guests; weigh the eggs in the shell, allow a third of their weight in Gruyère cheese, and a piece of butter one-sixth of the weight of the cheese.
10136-8{_}22521{_}Break the eggs into a basin, beat them well; add the cheese, which should be grated, and the butter, which should be broken into small pieces.
10136-8{_}22522{_}Stir these ingredients together with a wooden spoon; put the mixture into a lined saucepan, place it over the fire, and stir until the substance is thick and soft.
10136-8{_}22523{_}Put in a little salt, according to the age of the cheese, and a good sprinkling of pepper, and serve the fondue on a very hot silver or metal plate.
10136-8{_}22524{_}Do not allow the fondue to remain on the fire after the mixture is set, as, if it boils, it will be entirely spoiled.
10136-8{_}22525{_}Brillat Savarin recommends that some choice Burgundy should he handed round with this dish.
10136-8{_}22526{_}We have given this recipe exactly as he recommends it to be made; but we have tried it with good Cheshire cheese, and found it answer remarkably well.
10136-8{_}22527{_}_Time_.--About 4 minutes to set the mixture.
10136-8{_}22528{_}_Average cost_ for 4 persons, 10d.
10136-8{_}22529{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 egg, with the other ingredients in proportion, for one person.

10136-8{_}22536{_}of butter, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}22537{_}of Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of milk, 2 pints of water, bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}22538{_}_Mode_.--Put the milk and water into a saucepan with sufficient salt to flavour it; place it on the fire, and, when it boils quickly, drop in the macaroni.
10136-8{_}22539{_}Keep the water boiling until it is quite tender; drain the macaroni, and put it into a deep dish.
10136-8{_}22540{_}Have ready the grated cheese, either Parmesan or Cheshire; sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and some of the butter cut into small pieces, reserving some of the cheese for the top layer.
10136-8{_}22541{_}Season with a little pepper, and cover the top layer of cheese with some very fine bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}22542{_}Warm, without oiling, the remainder of the butter, and pour it gently over the bread crumbs.
10136-8{_}22543{_}Place the dish before a bright fire to brown the crumbs; turn it once or twice, that it may be equally coloured, and serve very hot.
10136-8{_}22544{_}The top of the macaroni may be browned with a salamander, which is even better than placing it before the fire, as the process is more expeditious; but it should never be browned in the oven, as the butter would oil, and so impart a very disagreeable flavour to the dish.
10136-8{_}22545{_}In boiling the macaroni, let it be perfectly tender but firm, no part beginning to melt, and the form entirely preserved.
10136-8{_}22546{_}It may be boiled in plain water, with a little salt instead of using milk, but should then have a small piece of butter mixed with it.
10136-8{_}22547{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to brown it before the fire.
10136-8{_}22548{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}22549{_}6d.
10136-8{_}22550{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.
10136-8{_}22551{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22552{_}_Note_.--Riband macaroni may be dressed in the same manner, but does not require boiling so long a time.
10136-8{_}22553{_}II.
10136-8{_}22554{_}1646.
10136-8{_}22555{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22556{_}of pipe or riband macaroni, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of veal or beef gravy, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}22557{_}of grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}22558{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}22559{_}_Mode_.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in the gravy and milk until quite tender, without being broken.
10136-8{_}22560{_}Drain it, and put it into rather a deep dish.
10136-8{_}22561{_}Beat the yolks of the eggs with the cream and 2 tablespoonfuls of the liquor the macaroni was boiled in; make this sufficiently hot to thicken, but do not allow it to boil; pour it over the macaroni, over which sprinkle the grated cheese and the butter broken into small pieces; brown with a salamander, or before the fire, and serve.
10136-8{_}22562{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to thicken the eggs and cream, 5 minutes to brown.

10136-8{_}22568{_}1647.
10136-8{_}22569{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22570{_}of pipe macaroni, 1/2 pint of brown gravy No.
10136-8{_}22571{_}436, 6 oz.
10136-8{_}22572{_}of grated Parmesan cheese.
10136-8{_}22573{_}_Mode_.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in salt and water until quite tender; drain it, and put it into rather a deep dish.
10136-8{_}22574{_}Have ready a pint of good brown gravy, pour it hot over the macaroni, and send it to table with grated Parmesan served on a separate dish.
10136-8{_}22575{_}When the flavour is liked, a little pounded mace may be added to the water in which the macaroni is boiled; but this must always be sparingly added, as it will impart a very strong flavour.
10136-8{_}22576{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni.
10136-8{_}22577{_}_Average cost_, with the gravy and cheese, 1s.
10136-8{_}22578{_}3d.

10136-8{_}22580{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22581{_}POUNDED CHEESE.
10136-8{_}22582{_}1648.
10136-8{_}22583{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}22584{_}of cheese allow 3 oz.
10136-8{_}22585{_}of fresh butter.
10136-8{_}22586{_}_Mode_.--To pound cheese is an economical way of using it, if it has become dry; it is exceedingly good spread on bread, and is the best way of eating it for those whose digestion is weak.
10136-8{_}22587{_}Cut up the cheese into small pieces, and pound it smoothly in a mortar, adding butter in the above proportion.
10136-8{_}22588{_}Press it down into a jar, cover with clarified butter, and it will keep for several days.
10136-8{_}22589{_}The flavour may be very much increased by adding mixed mustard (about a teaspoonful to every lb.
10136-8{_}22590{_}), or cayenne, or pounded mace.
10136-8{_}22591{_}Curry-powder is also not unfrequently mixed with it.
10136-8{_}22592{_}RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.
10136-8{_}22593{_}1649.
10136-8{_}22594{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22595{_}of Cheshire cheese, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22596{_}of Parmesan cheese, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22597{_}of fresh butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a small roll; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste.
10136-8{_}22598{_}_Mode_.--Boil the crumb of the roll in milk for 5 minutes; strain, and put it into a mortar; add the cheese, which should be finely scraped, the butter, the yolks of the eggs, and seasoning, and pound these ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}22599{_}Whisk the whites of the eggs, mix them with the paste, and put it into small pans or saucers, which should not be more than half filled.
10136-8{_}22600{_}Bake them from 10 to 12 minutes, and serve them very hot and very quickly.
10136-8{_}22601{_}This batter answers equally well for macaroni after it is boiled tender.
10136-8{_}22602{_}_Time_--10 to 12 minutes.
10136-8{_}22603{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}22604{_}4d.
10136-8{_}22605{_}_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.
10136-8{_}22606{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22607{_}PASTRY RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.
10136-8{_}22608{_}1650.
10136-8{_}22609{_}INGREDIENTS.--Any pieces of very good light puff-paste Cheshire, Parmesan, or Stilton cheese.
10136-8{_}22610{_}_Mode_.--The remains or odd pieces of paste left from large tarts, &c. answer for making these little dishes.
10136-8{_}22611{_}Gather up the pieces of paste, roll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated cheese of a nice flavour.
10136-8{_}22612{_}Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese over; fold the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in any way that may be desired.
10136-8{_}22613{_}Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven from 10 to 15 minutes, dish them on a hot napkin, and serve quickly.
10136-8{_}22614{_}The appearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the ramakins over with yolk of egg before they are placed in the oven.
10136-8{_}22615{_}Where expense is not objected to, Parmesan is the best kind of cheese to use for making this dish.
10136-8{_}22616{_}_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}22617{_}_Average cost_, with 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}22618{_}of paste, 10d.
10136-8{_}22619{_}_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.

10136-8{_}22621{_}TOASTED CHEESE, or SCOTCH RARE-BIT.
10136-8{_}22622{_}1651.
10136-8{_}22623{_}INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of rich cheese, toast, mustard, and pepper.
10136-8{_}22624{_}[Illustration: HOT-WATER CHEESE-DISH.]
10136-8{_}22625{_}_Mode_.--Cut some nice rich sound cheese into rather thin slices; melt it in a cheese-toaster on a hot plate, or over steam, and, when melted, add a small quantity of mixed mustard and a seasoning of pepper; stir the cheese until it is completely dissolved, then brown it before the fire, or with a salamander.
10136-8{_}22626{_}Fill the bottom of the cheese-toaster with hot water, and serve with dry or buttered toasts, whichever may be preferred.
10136-8{_}22627{_}Our engraving illustrates a cheese-toaster with hot-water reservoir: the cheese is melted in the upper tin, which is placed in another vessel of boiling water, so keeping the preparation beautifully hot.
10136-8{_}22628{_}A small quantity of porter, or port wine, is sometimes mixed with the cheese; and, if it be not very rich, a few pieces of butter may be mixed with it to great advantage.
10136-8{_}22629{_}Sometimes the melted cheese is spread on the toasts, and then laid in the cheese-dish at the top of the hot water.
10136-8{_}22630{_}Whichever way it is served, it is highly necessary that the mixture be very hot, and very quickly sent to table, or it will be worthless.
10136-8{_}22631{_}_Time_.--About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
10136-8{_}22632{_}_Average cost_, 1-1/2d.
10136-8{_}22633{_}per slice.
10136-8{_}22634{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person.
10136-8{_}22635{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22636{_}TOASTED CHEESE, or WELSH RARE-BIT.
10136-8{_}22637{_}1652.
10136-8{_}22638{_}INGREDIENTS.--Slices of bread, butter, Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard, and pepper.
10136-8{_}22639{_}_Mode_.--Cut the bread into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; pare off the crust, toast the bread slightly without hardening or burning it, and spread it with butter.
10136-8{_}22640{_}Cut some slices, not quite so large as the bread, from a good rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted.
10136-8{_}22641{_}Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper, and serve very hot, with very hot plates.
10136-8{_}22642{_}To facilitate the melting of the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before it is laid on the bread.
10136-8{_}22643{_}As it is so essential to send this dish hot to table, it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small round silver or metal pans, and to send these pans to table, allowing one for each guest.
10136-8{_}22644{_}Slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany them, with mustard, pepper, and salt.
10136-8{_}22645{_}_Time_.--About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
10136-8{_}22646{_}_Average cost_, 1-1/2d.
10136-8{_}22647{_}each slice.
10136-8{_}22648{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person.
10136-8{_}22649{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22650{_}_Note_.--Should the cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will be an improvement.
10136-8{_}22651{_}"COW CHEESE."
10136-8{_}22652{_}--It was only fifty years after Aristotle--the     fourth century before Christ--that butter began to be noticed as     an aliment.
10136-8{_}22653{_}The Greeks, in imitation of the Parthians and     Scythians, who used to send it to them, had it served upon their     tables, and called it at first "oil of milk," and later,     _bouturos_, "cow cheese."
10136-8{_}22654{_}SCOTCH WOODCOCK.
10136-8{_}22655{_}1653.
10136-8{_}22656{_}INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of hot buttered toast; allow 1 anchovy to each slice.
10136-8{_}22657{_}For the sauce,--1/4 pint of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs.
10136-8{_}22658{_}_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former, stir to them the cream, and bring the sauce to the boiling-point, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.
10136-8{_}22659{_}Have ready some hot buttered toast, spread with anchovies pounded to a paste; pour a little of the hot sauce on the top, and serve very hot and very quickly.
10136-8{_}22660{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to make the sauce hot.
10136-8{_}22661{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 slice to each person.
10136-8{_}22662{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22663{_}TO CHOOSE EGGS.
10136-8{_}22664{_}1654.
10136-8{_}22665{_}In choosing eggs, apply the tongue to the large end of the egg, and, if it feels warm, it is new, and may be relied on as a fresh egg.
10136-8{_}22666{_}Another mode of ascertaining their freshness is to hold them before a lighted candle, or to the light, and if the egg looks clear, it will be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if there is a black spot attached to the shell, it is worthless.
10136-8{_}22667{_}No egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it, as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed.
10136-8{_}22668{_}Eggs that are purchased, and that cannot be relied on, should always be broken in a cup, and then put into a basin: by this means stale or bad eggs may be easily rejected, without wasting the others.
10136-8{_}22669{_}EGGS contain, for their volume, a greater quantity of nutriment     than any other article of food.
10136-8{_}22670{_}But it does not follow that they     are always good for weak stomachs; quite the contrary; for it is     often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work     upon, a considerable volume of _ingesta_, over which the     nutritive matter is diffused, and so exposed to the action of     the gastric juice at many points.
10136-8{_}22671{_}There are many persons who     cannot digest eggs, however cooked.
10136-8{_}22672{_}It is said, however, that     their digestibility decreases in proportion to the degree in     which they are hardened by boiling.
10136-8{_}22673{_}TO KEEP EGGS FRESH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
10136-8{_}22674{_}1655.
10136-8{_}22675{_}Have ready a large saucepan, capable of holding 3 or 4 quarts, full of boiling water.
10136-8{_}22676{_}Put the eggs into a cabbage-net, say 20 at a time, and hold them in the water (which must be kept boiling) _for_ 20 _seconds_.
10136-8{_}22677{_}Proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you wish to preserve; then pack them away in sawdust.
10136-8{_}22678{_}We have tried this method of preserving eggs, and can vouch for its excellence: they will be found, at the end of 2 or 3 months, quite good enough for culinary purposes; and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a new-laid egg, the yolk will be nearly the same.
10136-8{_}22679{_}Many persons keep eggs for a long time by smearing the shells with butter or sweet oil: they should then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, and the eggs not allowed to touch each other.
10136-8{_}22680{_}Eggs for storing should be collected in fine weather, and should not be more than 24 hours old when they are packed away, or their flavour, when used, cannot be relied on.
10136-8{_}22681{_}Another simple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in lime-water soon after they have been laid, and then to put the vessel containing the lime-water in a cellar or cool outhouse.
10136-8{_}22682{_}_Seasonable_.--The best time for preserving eggs is from July to September.
10136-8{_}22683{_}EGGS.--The quality of eggs is said to be very much affected by     the food of the fowls who lay them.
10136-8{_}22684{_}Herbs and grain together     make a better food than grain only.
10136-8{_}22685{_}When the hens eat too many     insects, the eggs have a disagreeable flavour.
10136-8{_}22686{_}TO BOIL EGGS FOR BREAKFAST, SALADS, &c.  [Illustration: EGG-STAND FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.]
10136-8{_}22687{_}1656.
10136-8{_}22688{_}Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid; but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid egg than for one that is three or four days old.
10136-8{_}22689{_}Have ready a saucepan of boiling water; put the eggs into it gently with a spoon, letting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is withdrawn, that the egg may not fall, and consequently crack.
10136-8{_}22690{_}For those who like eggs lightly boiled, 3 minutes will be found sufficient; 3-3/4 to 4 minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; and, if liked hard, 6 to 7 minutes will not be found too long.
10136-8{_}22691{_}Should the eggs be unusually large, as those of black Spanish fowls sometimes are, allow an extra 1/2 minute for them.
10136-8{_}22692{_}Eggs for salads should be boiled from 10 minutes to 1/4 hour, and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a few minutes; they should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel off easily.
10136-8{_}22693{_}_Time_.--To boil eggs lightly, for invalids or children, 3 minutes; to boil eggs to suit the generality of tastes, 3-3/4 to 4 minutes; to boil eggs hard, 6 to 7 minutes; for salads, 10 to 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}22694{_}_Note_.--Silver or plated egg-dishes, like that shown in our engraving, are now very much used.
10136-8{_}22695{_}The price of the one illustrated is £2.

10136-8{_}22697{_}Slack, 336, Strand.
10136-8{_}22698{_}EGGS.--When fresh eggs are dropped into a vessel _full_ of     boiling water, they crack, because the eggs being well filled,     the shells give way to the efforts of the interior fluids,     dilated by heat.
10136-8{_}22699{_}If the volume of hot water be small, the shells     do not crack, because its temperature is reduced by the eggs     before the interior dilation can take place.
10136-8{_}22700{_}Stale eggs, again,     do not crack, because the air inside is easily compressed.
10136-8{_}22701{_}BUTTERED EGGS.
10136-8{_}22702{_}1657.
10136-8{_}22703{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 new-laid eggs, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}22704{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}22705{_}_Mode_.--Procure the eggs new-laid if possible; break them into a basin, and beat them well; put the butter into another basin, which place in boiling water, and stir till the butter is melted.
10136-8{_}22706{_}Pour that and the eggs into a lined saucepan; hold it over a gentle fire, and, as the mixture begins to warm, pour it two or three times into the basin, and back again, that the two ingredients may be well incorporated.
10136-8{_}22707{_}Keep stirring the eggs and butter one way until they are hot, _without boiling_, and serve on hot buttered toast.
10136-8{_}22708{_}If the mixture is allowed to boil, it will curdle, and so be entirely spoiled.
10136-8{_}22709{_}_Time_.--About 5 minutes to make the eggs hot.
10136-8{_}22710{_}_Average cost_, 7d.
10136-8{_}22711{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person.

10136-8{_}22713{_}DUCKS' EGGS.
10136-8{_}22714{_}1658.
10136-8{_}22715{_}Ducks' eggs are usually so strongly flavoured that, plainly boiled, they are not good for eating; they answer, however, very well for various culinary preparations where eggs are required; such as custards, &c. &c. Being so large and highly-flavoured, 1 duck's egg will go as far as 2 small hen's eggs; besides making whatever they are mixed with exceedingly rich.
10136-8{_}22716{_}They also are admirable when used in puddings.
10136-8{_}22717{_}PRIMITIVE METHOD OF COOKING EGGS.--The shepherds of Egypt had a     singular manner of cooking eggs without the aid of fire.
10136-8{_}22718{_}They     placed them in a sling, which they turned so rapidly that the     friction of the air heated them to the exact point required for     use.

10136-8{_}22720{_}1659.
10136-8{_}22721{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}22722{_}of lard, butter or clarified dripping.
10136-8{_}22723{_}[Illustration: FRIED EGGS ON BACON.]
10136-8{_}22724{_}_Mode_.--Place a delicately-clean frying-pan over a gentle fire; put in the fat, and allow it to come to the boiling-point.
10136-8{_}22725{_}Break the eggs into cups, slip them into the boiling fat, and let them remain until the whites are delicately set; and, whilst they are frying, ladle a little of the fat over them.
10136-8{_}22726{_}Take them up with a slice, drain them for a minute from their greasy moisture, trim them neatly, and serve on slices of fried bacon or ham; or the eggs may be placed in the middle of the dish, with the bacon put round as a garnish.

10136-8{_}22733{_}VENERATION FOR EGGS.--Many of the most learned philosophers held     eggs in a kind of respect, approaching to veneration, because     they saw in them the emblem of the world and the four elements.
10136-8{_}22734{_}The shell, they said, represented the earth; the white, water;     the yolk, fire; and air was found under the shell at one end of     the egg.

10136-8{_}22738{_}of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of milk, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 6 eggs.
10136-8{_}22739{_}_Mode_.--Put the flour and half the butter into a stewpan; stir them over the fire until the mixture thickens; pour in the milk, which should be boiling; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and simmer the whole for 5 minutes.
10136-8{_}22740{_}Put the remainder of the butter into the sauce, and add the minced parsley; then boil the eggs hard, strip off the shells, cut the eggs into quarters, and put them on a dish.
10136-8{_}22741{_}Bring the sauce to the boiling-point, add the lemon-juice, pour over the eggs, and serve.
10136-8{_}22742{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the sauce; the eggs, 10 to 15 minutes.
10136-8{_}22743{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}22744{_}_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.
10136-8{_}22745{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22746{_}OEUFS AU PLAT, or AU MIROIR, served on the Dish in which they are Cooked.
10136-8{_}22747{_}1661.
10136-8{_}22748{_}INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}22749{_}of butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}22750{_}_Mode_.--Butter a dish rather thickly with good fresh butter; melt it, break the eggs into it the same as for poaching, sprinkle them with white pepper and fine salt, and put the remainder of the butter, cut into very small pieces, on the top of them.
10136-8{_}22751{_}Put the dish on a hot plate, or in the oven, or before the fire, and let it remain until the whites become set, but not hard, when serve immediately, placing the dish they were cooked in on another.
10136-8{_}22752{_}To hasten the cooking of the eggs, a salamander may be held over them for a minute; but great care must be taken that they are not too much done.
10136-8{_}22753{_}This is an exceedingly nice dish, and one very easily prepared for breakfast.
10136-8{_}22754{_}_Time_.--3 minutes.
10136-8{_}22755{_}_Average cost_, 5d.
10136-8{_}22756{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.
10136-8{_}22757{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}22758{_}PLOVERS' EGGS.
10136-8{_}22759{_}1662.
10136-8{_}22760{_}Plovers' eggs are usually served boiled hard, and sent to table in a napkin, either hot or cold.
10136-8{_}22761{_}They may also be shelled, and served the same as eggs à la Tripe, with a good Béchamel sauce, or brown gravy, poured over them.
10136-8{_}22762{_}They are also used for decorating salads, the beautiful colour of the white being generally so much admired.

10136-8{_}22764{_}[Illustration: EGGS POACHED ON TOAST.]
10136-8{_}22765{_}[Illustration: TIN EGG-POACHER.]
10136-8{_}22766{_}1663.
10136-8{_}22767{_}INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, water.
10136-8{_}22768{_}To every pint of water allow 1 tablespoonful of vinegar.
10136-8{_}22769{_}_Mode_.--Eggs for poaching should be perfectly fresh, but not quite new-laid; those that are about 36 hours old are the best for the purpose.
10136-8{_}22770{_}If quite new-laid, the white is so milky it is almost impossible to set it; and, on the other hand, if the egg be at all stale, it is equally difficult to poach it nicely.
10136-8{_}22771{_}Strain some boiling water into a deep clean frying-pan; break the egg into a cup without damaging the yolk, and, when the water boils, remove the pan to the side of the fire, and gently slip the egg into it.
10136-8{_}22772{_}Place the pan over a gentle fire, and keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely set, when the egg is ready.
10136-8{_}22773{_}Take it up gently with a slice, cut away the ragged edges of the white, and serve either on toasted bread or on slices of ham or bacon, or on spinach, &c. A poached egg should not be overdone, as its appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden.
10136-8{_}22774{_}When the egg is slipped into the water, the white should be gathered together, to keep it a little in form, or the cup should be turned over it for 1 minute.
10136-8{_}22775{_}To poach an egg to perfection is rather a difficult operation; so, for inexperienced cooks, a tin egg-poacher may be purchased, which greatly facilitates this manner of dressing ecgs.
10136-8{_}22776{_}Our illustration clearly shows what it is: it consists of a tin plate with a handle, with a space for three perforated cups.
10136-8{_}22777{_}An egg should be broken into each cup, and the machine then placed in a stewpan of boiling water, which has been previously strained.
10136-8{_}22778{_}When the whites of the eggs appear set, they are done, and should then be carefully slipped on to the toast or spinach, or with whatever they are served.
10136-8{_}22779{_}In poaching eggs in a frying-pan, never do more than four at a time; and, when a little vinegar is liked mixed with the water in which the eggs are done, use the above proportion.
10136-8{_}22780{_}_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3-1/2 minutes, according to the size of the egg.
10136-8{_}22781{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 eggs to each person.
10136-8{_}22782{_}_Seasonable_ at any time, but less plentiful in winter.
10136-8{_}22783{_}POACHED EGGS, WITH CREAM.
10136-8{_}22784{_}1664.
10136-8{_}22785{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 4 teaspoonfuls of vinegar, 4 fresh eggs, 1/2 gill of cream, salt, pepper, and pounded sugar to taste, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}22786{_}of butter.
10136-8{_}22787{_}_Mode_.--Put the water, vinegar, and salt into a frying-pan, and break each egg into a separate cup; bring the water, &c. to boil, and slip the eggs gently into it without breaking the yolks.
10136-8{_}22788{_}Simmer them from 3 to 4 minutes, but not longer, and, with a slice, lift them out on to a hot dish, and trim the edges.
10136-8{_}22789{_}Empty the pan of its contents, put in the cream, add a seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded sugar; bring the whole to the boiling-point; then add the butter, broken into small pieces; toss the pan round and round till the butter is melted; pour it over the eggs, and serve.
10136-8{_}22790{_}To insure the eggs not being spoiled whilst the cream, &c., is preparing, it is a good plan to warm the cream with the butter, &c., before the eggs are poached, so that it may be poured over them immediately after they are dished.
10136-8{_}22791{_}_Time_.--3 to 4 minutes to poach the eggs, 5 minutes to warm the cream.
10136-8{_}22792{_}_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 9d.
10136-8{_}22793{_}_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.
10136-8{_}22794{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}22806{_}417; or substitute pounded anchovies for the ham.
10136-8{_}22807{_}Fry the eggs a nice brown in boiling lard, drain them before the fire from their greasy moisture, dish them, and pour round from 1/4 to 1/2 pint of good brown gravy.
10136-8{_}22808{_}To enhance the appearance of the eggs, they may be rolled in beaten egg and sprinkled with bread crumbs; but this is scarcely necessary if they are carefully fried.
10136-8{_}22809{_}The flavour of the ham or anchovy in the forcemeat must preponderate, as it should be very relishing.
10136-8{_}22810{_}_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the eggs, 5 to 7 minutes to fry them.

10136-8{_}22819{_}_Mode_.--Boil the eggs hard; put them into cold water, peel them, take out the yolks whole, and shred the whites.
10136-8{_}22820{_}Make 3/4 pint of Béchamel sauce by recipe No.
10136-8{_}22821{_}368; add the parsley, and, when the sauce is quite hot, put the yolks of the eggs into the middle of the dish, and the shred whites round them; pour over the sauce, and garnish with leaves of puff-paste or fried croûtons.
10136-8{_}22822{_}There is no necessity for putting the eggs into the saucepan with the Béchamel; the sauce, being quite hot, will warm the eggs sufficiently.

10136-8{_}22828{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES.
10136-8{_}22829{_}BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING.
10136-8{_}22830{_}1668.
10136-8{_}22831{_}AMONG the numerous vegetable products yielding articles of food for man, the Cereals hold the first place.
10136-8{_}22832{_}By means of skilful cultivation, mankind have transformed the original forms of these growths, poor and ill-flavoured as they perhaps were, into various fruitful and agreeable species, which yield an abundant and pleasant supply.
10136-8{_}22833{_}Classified according to their respective richness in alimentary elements, the Cereals stand thus:--Wheat, and its varieties, Rye, Barley, Oats, Rice, Indian Corn.
10136-8{_}22834{_}Everybody knows it is wheat flour which yields the best bread.
10136-8{_}22835{_}Rye-bread is viscous, hard, less easily soluble by the gastric juice, and not so rich in nutritive power.
10136-8{_}22836{_}Flour produced from barley, Indian corn, or rice, is not so readily made into bread; and the article, when made, is heavy and indigestible.
10136-8{_}22837{_}1669.
10136-8{_}22838{_}On examining a grain of corn from any of the numerous cereals [Footnote: _Cereal,_ a corn-producing plant; from Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.]
10136-8{_}22839{_}used in the preparation of flour, such as wheat, maize, rye, barley, &c., it will be found to consist of two parts,--the husk, or exterior covering, which is generally of a dark colour, and the inner, or albuminous part, which is more or less white.
10136-8{_}22840{_}In grinding, these two portions are separated, and the husk being blown away in the process of winnowing, the flour remains in the form of a light brown powder, consisting principally of starch and gluten.
10136-8{_}22841{_}In order to render it white, it undergoes a process called "bolting."
10136-8{_}22842{_}It is passed through a series of fine sieves, which separate the coarser parts, leaving behind fine white flour,--the "fine firsts" of the corn-dealer.
10136-8{_}22843{_}The process of bolting, as just described, tends to deprive flour of its gluten, the coarser and darker portion containing much of that substance; while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch.
10136-8{_}22844{_}Bran contains a large proportion of gluten; hence it will be seen why brown broad is so much more nutritious than white; in fact, we may lay it down as a general rule, that the whiter the bread the less nourishment it contains.
10136-8{_}22845{_}Majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with white wheaten bread, at the end of which time he died; while another dog, fed on brown bread made with flour mixed with bran, lived without any disturbance of his health.
10136-8{_}22846{_}The "bolting" process, then, is rather injurious than beneficial in its result; and is one of the numerous instances where fashion has chosen a wrong standard to go by.
10136-8{_}22847{_}In ancient times, down to the Emperors, no bolted flour was known.
10136-8{_}22848{_}In many parts of Germany the entire meal is used; and in no part of the world are the digestive organs of the people in a better condition.
10136-8{_}22849{_}In years of famine, when corn is scarce, the use of bolted flour is most culpable, for from 18 to 20 per cent, is lost in bran.
10136-8{_}22850{_}Brown bread has, of late years, become very popular; and many physicians have recommended it to invalids with weak digestions with great success.
10136-8{_}22851{_}This rage for white bread has introduced adulterations of a very serious character, affecting the health of the whole community.
10136-8{_}22852{_}Potatoes are added for this purpose; but this is a comparatively harmless cheat, only reducing the nutritive property of the bread; but bone-dust and alum are also put in, which are far from harmless.
10136-8{_}22853{_}1670.
10136-8{_}22854{_}Bread-making is a very ancient art indeed.
10136-8{_}22855{_}The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks, used to make bread, in which oil, with aniseed and other spices, was an element; but this was unleavened.
10136-8{_}22856{_}Every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption, the _trade_ of baking not having yet taken shape.
10136-8{_}22857{_}It is said, that somewhere about the beginning of the thirtieth Olympiad, the slave of an archon, at Athens, made leavened bread by accident.
10136-8{_}22858{_}He had left some wheaten dough in an earthen pan, and forgotten it; some days afterwards, he lighted upon it again, and found it turning sour.
10136-8{_}22859{_}His first thought was to throw it away; but, his master coming up, he mixed this now acescent dough with some fresh dough, which he was working at.
10136-8{_}22860{_}The bread thus produced, by the introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun, was found delicious by the archon and his friends; and the slave, being summoned and catechised, told the secret.
10136-8{_}22861{_}It spread all over Athens; and everybody wanting leavened bread at once, certain persons set up as bread-makers, or bakers.
10136-8{_}22862{_}In a short time bread-baking became quite an art, and "Athenian bread" was quoted all over Greece as the best bread, just as the honey of Hyamettus was celebrated as the best honey.
10136-8{_}22863{_}1671.
10136-8{_}22864{_}In our own times, and among civilized peoples, bread has become an article of food of the first necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of itself a complete life-sustainer, the gluten, starch, and sugar, which it contains, representing azotized and hydro-carbonated nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product.
10136-8{_}22865{_}1672.
10136-8{_}22866{_}WHEATEN BREAD.--The finest, wholesomest, and most savoury bread is made from wheaten flour.
10136-8{_}22867{_}There are, of wheat, three leading qualities,-- the soft, the medium, and the hard wheat; the last of which yields a kind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat, but is richer in gluten, and, consequently, more nutritive.
10136-8{_}22868{_}1673.
10136-8{_}22869{_}RYE BREAD.--This comes next to wheaten bread: it is not so rich in gluten, but is said to keep fresh longer, and to have some laxative qualities.
10136-8{_}22870{_}1674.
10136-8{_}22871{_}BARLEY BREAD, INDIAN-CORN BREAD, &c.--Bread made from barley, maize, oats, rice, potatoes, &c. "rises" badly, because the grains in question contain but little gluten, which makes the bread heavy, close in texture, and difficult of digestion; in fact, corn-flour has to be added before panification can take place.
10136-8{_}22872{_}In countries where wheat is scarce and maize abundant, the people make the latter a chief article of sustenance, when prepared in different forms.
10136-8{_}22873{_}BREAD-MAKING.
10136-8{_}22874{_}1675.
10136-8{_}22875{_}PANIFICATION, or bread-making, consists of the following processes, in the case of Wheaten Flour.
10136-8{_}22876{_}Fifty or sixty per cent.
10136-8{_}22877{_}of water is added to the flour, with the addition of some leavening matter, and, preferably, of yeast from malt and hops.
10136-8{_}22878{_}All kinds of leavening matter have, however, been, and are still used in different parts of the world: in the East Indies, "toddy," which is a liquor that flows from the wounded cocoa-nut tree; and, in the West Indies, "dunder," or the refuse of the distillation of rum.
10136-8{_}22879{_}The dough then undergoes the well-known process called _kneading_.
10136-8{_}22880{_}The yeast produces fermentation, a process which may be thus described:--The dough reacting upon the leavening matter introduced, the starch of the flour is transformed into saccharine matter, the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into alcohol and carbonic acid.
10136-8{_}22881{_}The dough must be well "bound," and yet allow the escape of the little bubbles of carbonic acid which accompany the fermentation, and which, in their passage, cause the numerous little holes which are seen in light bread.
10136-8{_}22882{_}1676.
10136-8{_}22883{_}The yeast must be good and fresh, if the bread is to be digestible and nice.
10136-8{_}22884{_}Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an acetous fermentation, which flavours the bread and makes it disagreeable.
10136-8{_}22885{_}A poor thin yeast produces an imperfect fermentation, the result being a heavy unwholesome loaf.
10136-8{_}22886{_}1677.
10136-8{_}22887{_}When the dough is well kneaded, it is left to stand for some time, and then, as soon as it begins to swell, it is divided into loaves; after which it is again left to stand, when it once more swells up, and manifests, for the last time, the symptoms of fermentation.
10136-8{_}22888{_}It is then put into the oven, where the water contained in the dough is partly evaporated, and the loaves swell up again, while a yellow crust begins to form upon the surface.
10136-8{_}22889{_}When the bread is sufficiently baked, the bottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger, while the crumb is elastic, and rises again after being pressed down with the finger.
10136-8{_}22890{_}The bread is, in all probability, baked sufficiently if, on opening the door of the oven, you are met by a cloud of steam which quickly passes away.
10136-8{_}22891{_}1678.
10136-8{_}22892{_}One word as to the unwholesomeness of new bread and hot rolls.
10136-8{_}22893{_}When bread is taken out of the oven, it is full of moisture; the starch is held together in masses, and the bread, instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain of starch to the saliva, actually prevents their digestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses, which lie on the stomach like so many bullets.
10136-8{_}22894{_}Bread should always be at least a day old before it is eaten; and, if properly made, and kept in a _cool dry_ place, ought to be perfectly soft and palatable at the end of three or four days.
10136-8{_}22895{_}Hot rolls, swimming in melted butter, and new bread, ought to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect for that much-injured individual--the Stomach.
10136-8{_}22896{_}1679.
10136-8{_}22897{_}AERATED BREAD.--It is not unknown to some of our readers that Dr. Dauglish, of Malvern, has recently patented a process for making bread "light" without the use of leaven.
10136-8{_}22898{_}The ordinary process of bread-making by fermentation is tedious, and much labour of human hands is requisite in the kneading, in order that the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated with the leaven.
10136-8{_}22899{_}The new process impregnates the bread, by the application of machinery, with carbonic acid gas, or fixed air.
10136-8{_}22900{_}Different opinions are expressed about the bread; but it is curious to note, that, as corn is now reaped by machinery, and dough is baked by machinery, the whole process of bread-making is probably in course of undergoing changes which will emancipate both the housewife and the professional baker from a large amount of labour.
10136-8{_}22901{_}1680.
10136-8{_}22902{_}In the production of Aërated Bread, wheaten flour, water, salt, and carbonic acid gas (generated by proper machinery), are the only materials employed.
10136-8{_}22903{_}We need not inform our readers that carbonic acid gas is the source of the effervescence, whether in common water coming from a depth, or in lemonade, or any aërated drink.
10136-8{_}22904{_}Its action, in the new bread, takes the place of fermentation in the old.
10136-8{_}22905{_}1681.
10136-8{_}22906{_}In the patent process, the dough is mixed in a great iron ball, inside which is a system of paddles, perpetually turning, and doing the kneading part of the business.
10136-8{_}22907{_}Into this globe the flour is dropped till it is full, and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out, and the pure gas turned on.
10136-8{_}22908{_}The gas is followed by the water, which has been aërated for the purpose, and then begins the churning or kneading part of the business.
10136-8{_}22909{_}1682.
10136-8{_}22910{_}Of course, it is not long before we have the dough, and very "light" and nice it looks.
10136-8{_}22911{_}This is caught in tins, and passed on to the floor of the oven, which is an endless floor, moving slowly through the fire.
10136-8{_}22912{_}Done to a turn, the loaves emerge at the other end of the apartment,--and the Aërated Bread is made.
10136-8{_}22913{_}1683.
10136-8{_}22914{_}It may be added, that it is a good plan to change one's baker from time to time, and so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is eaten.
10136-8{_}22915{_}1684.
10136-8{_}22916{_}MIXED BREADS.--Rye bread is hard of digestion, and requires longer and slower baking than wheaten bread.
10136-8{_}22917{_}It is better when made with leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast, and turns out lighter.
10136-8{_}22918{_}It should not be eaten till two days old.
10136-8{_}22919{_}It will keep a long time.
10136-8{_}22920{_}1685.
10136-8{_}22921{_}A good bread may be made by mixing rye-flour, wheat-flour, and rice-paste in equal proportions; also by mixing rye, wheat, and barley.
10136-8{_}22922{_}In Norway, it is said that they only bake their barley broad once a year, such is its "keeping" quality.
10136-8{_}22923{_}1686.
10136-8{_}22924{_}Indian-corn flour mixed with wheat-flour (half with half) makes a nice bread; but it is not considered very digestible, though it keeps well.
10136-8{_}22925{_}1687.
10136-8{_}22926{_}Rice cannot be made into bread, nor can potatoes; but one-third potato flour to three-fourths wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf.
10136-8{_}22927{_}1688.
10136-8{_}22928{_}A very good bread, better than the ordinary sort, and of a delicious flavour, is said to be produced by adopting the following recipe:--Take ten parts of wheat-flour, five parts of potato-flour, one part of rice-paste; knead together, add the yeast, and bake as usual.
10136-8{_}22929{_}This is, of course, cheaper than wheaten bread.
10136-8{_}22930{_}1689.
10136-8{_}22931{_}Flour, when freshly ground, is too glutinous to make good bread, and should therefore not be used immediately, but should be kept dry for a few weeks, and stirred occasionally, until it becomes dry, and crumbles easily between the fingers.
10136-8{_}22932{_}1690.
10136-8{_}22933{_}Flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or cakes; if at all damp, the preparation is sure to be heavy.
10136-8{_}22934{_}Before mixing it with the other ingredients, it is a good plan to place it for an hour or two before the fire, until it feels warm and dry.
10136-8{_}22935{_}1691.
10136-8{_}22936{_}Yeast from home-brewed beer is generally preferred to any other: it is very bitter, and, on that account, should be well washed, and put away until the thick mass settles.
10136-8{_}22937{_}If it still continues bitter, the process should be repeated; and, before being used, all the water floating at the top must be poured off.
10136-8{_}22938{_}German yeast is now very much used, and should be moistened, and thoroughly mixed with the milk or water with which the bread is to be made.
10136-8{_}22939{_}1692.
10136-8{_}22940{_}The following observations are extracted from a valuable work on Bread-making, [Footnote: "The English Bread-Book."
10136-8{_}22941{_}By Eliza Acton.
10136-8{_}22942{_}London: Longman.]
10136-8{_}22943{_}and will be found very useful to our readers:--  1693.
10136-8{_}22944{_}The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it; and, in addition to these, there must be attention and care through the whole process.
10136-8{_}22945{_}1694.
10136-8{_}22946{_}An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made, and to allow it to become cold before it is finished.
10136-8{_}22947{_}The other most common causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet, or which has been frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it.
10136-8{_}22948{_}1695.
10136-8{_}22949{_}Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise, will cause the bread to be heavy.
10136-8{_}22950{_}1696.
10136-8{_}22951{_}Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hard, and letting it become quite, cold, particularly in winter.
10136-8{_}22952{_}1697.
10136-8{_}22953{_}If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself, that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either, sour bread will probably be the consequence in warm weather, and bad bread in any.
10136-8{_}22954{_}The goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation.
10136-8{_}22955{_}1698.
10136-8{_}22956{_}MILK OR BUTTER.--Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavour of the bread, but, in sultry weather, will often cause it to be quite uneatable; yet either of them, if fresh and good, will materially improve its quality.
10136-8{_}22957{_}1699.
10136-8{_}22958{_}To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be put into a clean earthen pan, with a cover to it: this pan should be placed at a little distance from the ground, to allow a current of air to pass underneath.
10136-8{_}22959{_}Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden shelves, without being covered, that the crust may not soften.
10136-8{_}22960{_}Stale bread may be freshened by warming it through in a gentle oven.
10136-8{_}22961{_}Stale pastry, cakes, &c., may also be improved by this method.
10136-8{_}22962{_}1700.
10136-8{_}22963{_}The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are a kneading-trough or pan, sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges, and also to allow for its rising; a hair sieve for straining yeast, and one or two strong spoons.
10136-8{_}22964{_}1701.
10136-8{_}22965{_}Yeast must always be good of its kind, and in a fitting state to produce ready and proper fermentation.
10136-8{_}22966{_}Yeast of strong beer or ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds; and the fresher the yeast, the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough.
10136-8{_}22967{_}1702.
10136-8{_}22968{_}As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside.
10136-8{_}22969{_}The oven door should not be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set, or has become firm, as the cool air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it.
10136-8{_}22970{_}1703.
10136-8{_}22971{_}Brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking bread: these should be heated with wood faggots, and then swept and mopped out, to cleanse them for the reception of the bread.
10136-8{_}22972{_}Iron ovens are more difficult to manage, being apt to burn the surface of the bread before the middle is baked.
10136-8{_}22973{_}To remedy this, a few clean bricks should be set at the bottom of the oven, close together, to receive the tins of bread.
10136-8{_}22974{_}In many modern stoves the ovens are so much improved that they bake admirably; and they can always be brought to the required temperature, when it is higher than is needed, by leaving the door open for a time.
10136-8{_}22975{_}A FEW HINTS respecting the Making and Baking of CAKES.
10136-8{_}22976{_}1704.
10136-8{_}22977{_}_Eggs_ should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks separated, and they should always be strained.
10136-8{_}22978{_}Breaking the eggs thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others, and so cause no waste.
10136-8{_}22979{_}As eggs are used instead of yeast, they should be very thoroughly whisked; they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls from the whisk.
10136-8{_}22980{_}1705.
10136-8{_}22981{_}_Loaf Sugar_ should be well pounded, and then sifted through a fine sieve.
10136-8{_}22982{_}1706.
10136-8{_}22983{_}_Currants_ should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and then carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them.
10136-8{_}22984{_}They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, to become thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy.
10136-8{_}22985{_}1707.
10136-8{_}22986{_}_Good Butter_ should always be used in the manufacture of cakes; and if beaten to a cream, it saves much time and labour to warm, but not melt, it before beating.
10136-8{_}22987{_}1708.
10136-8{_}22988{_}Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}22989{_}1709.
10136-8{_}22990{_}The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large cakes.
10136-8{_}22991{_}If the heat be not tolerably fierce, the batter will not rise.
10136-8{_}22992{_}If the oven is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake burning or catching, put a sheet of clean paper over the top.
10136-8{_}22993{_}Newspaper, or paper that has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose.
10136-8{_}22994{_}1710.
10136-8{_}22995{_}To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it; draw it quickly out, and if it looks in the least sticky, put the cake back, and close the oven door until the cake is done.
10136-8{_}22996{_}1711.
10136-8{_}22997{_}Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars, and in a dry place.
10136-8{_}22998{_}Those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made without it.
10136-8{_}22999{_}BISCUITS.
10136-8{_}23000{_}1712.
10136-8{_}23001{_}Since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories, biscuits have been produced both cheap and wholesome, in, comparatively speaking, endless variety.
10136-8{_}23002{_}Their actual component parts are, perhaps, known only to the various makers; but there are several kinds of biscuits which have long been in use, that may here be advantageously described.
10136-8{_}23003{_}1713.
10136-8{_}23004{_}Biscuits belong to the class of unfermented bread, and are, perhaps, the most wholesome of that class.
10136-8{_}23005{_}In cases where fermented bread does not agree with the human stomach, they may be recommended: in many instances they are considered lighter, and less liable to create acidity and flatulence.
10136-8{_}23006{_}The name is derived from the French _bis cuit_, "twice-baked," because, originally, that was the mode of entirely depriving them of all moisture, to insure their keeping; but, although that process is no longer employed, the name is retained.
10136-8{_}23007{_}The use of this kind of bread on land is pretty general, and some varieties are luxuries; but, at sea, biscuits are articles of the first necessity.
10136-8{_}23008{_}1714.
10136-8{_}23009{_}SEA, or SHIP BISCUITS, are made of wheat-flour from which only the coarsest bran has been separated.
10136-8{_}23010{_}The dough is made up as stiff as it can be worked, and is then formed into shapes, and baked in an oven; after which, the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven until perfectly dry, to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored.
10136-8{_}23011{_}1715.
10136-8{_}23012{_}CAPTAINS' BISCUITS are made in a similar manner, only of fine flour.

10136-8{_}23015{_}TO MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD.
10136-8{_}23016{_}1716.
10136-8{_}23017{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}23018{_}of hops, 3 quarts of water, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}23019{_}of bruised malt, 1/2 pint of yeast.
10136-8{_}23020{_}_Mode_.--Boil the hops in the water for 20 minutes; let it stand for about 5 minutes, then add it to 1 lb.
10136-8{_}23021{_}of bruised malt prepared as for brewing.
10136-8{_}23022{_}Let the mixture stand covered till about lukewarm; then put in not quite 1/2 pint of yeast; keep it warm, and let it work 3 or 4 hours; then put it into small 1/2-pint bottles (ginger-beer bottles are the best for the purpose), cork them well, and tie them down.
10136-8{_}23023{_}The yeast is now ready for use; it will keep good for a few weeks, and 1 bottle will be found sufficient for 18 lbs.
10136-8{_}23024{_}of flour.
10136-8{_}23025{_}When required for use, boil 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}23026{_}of potatoes without salt, mash them in the same water in which they were boiled, and rub them through a colander.
10136-8{_}23027{_}Stir in about 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23028{_}of flour; then put in the yeast, pour it in the middle of the flour, and let it stand warm on the hearth all night, and in the morning let it be quite warm when it is kneaded.
10136-8{_}23029{_}The bottles of yeast require very careful opening, as it is generally exceedingly ripe.
10136-8{_}23030{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water, the yeast to work 3 or 4 hours.
10136-8{_}23031{_}_Sufficient._--1/2 pint sufficient for 18 lbs.
10136-8{_}23032{_}of flour.
10136-8{_}23033{_}KIRKLEATHAM YEAST.
10136-8{_}23034{_}1717.
10136-8{_}23035{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 oz.
10136-8{_}23036{_}of hops, 4 quarts of water, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23037{_}of flour, 1/2 pint of yeast.
10136-8{_}23038{_}_Mode_.--Boil the hops and water for 20 minutes; strain, and mix with the liquid 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23039{_}of flour and not quite 1/2 pint of yeast.
10136-8{_}23040{_}Bottle it up, and tie the corks down.
10136-8{_}23041{_}When wanted for use, boil potatoes according to the quantity of bread to be made (about 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}23042{_}are sufficient for about a peck of flour); mash them, add to them 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23043{_}of flour, and mix about 1/2 pint of the yeast with them; let this mixture stand all day, and lay the bread to rise the night before it is wanted.
10136-8{_}23044{_}_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water.
10136-8{_}23045{_}_Sufficient_.--1/2 pint of this yeast sufficient for a peck of flour, or rather more.
10136-8{_}23046{_}TO MAKE GOOD HOME-MADE BREAD.
10136-8{_}23047{_}(_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}23048{_}1718.
10136-8{_}23049{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 quartern of flour, 1 large tablespoonful of solid brewer's yeast, or nearly 1 oz.
10136-8{_}23050{_}of fresh German yeast, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 pint of warm milk-and-water.
10136-8{_}23051{_}[Illustration: COTTAGE LOAF.]
10136-8{_}23052{_}[Illustration: TIN BREAD.]
10136-8{_}23053{_}_Mode_.--Put the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan; then, with a strong metal or wooden spoon, hollow out the middle; but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan, as, in that case, the sponge (or leaven, as it was formerly termed) would stick to it, which it ought not to do.
10136-8{_}23054{_}Next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer's yeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night; or nearly an ounce of German yeast; put it into a large basin, and proceed to mix it, so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with 3/4 pint of warm milk-and-water, or with water only; though even a very little milk will much improve the bread.
10136-8{_}23055{_}Pour the yeast into the hole made in the flour, and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will make a thick batter, in which there must be no lumps.
10136-8{_}23056{_}Strew plenty of flour on the top; throw a thick clean cloth over, and set it where the air is warm; but do not place it upon the kitchen fender, for it will become too much heated there.
10136-8{_}23057{_}Look at it from time to time: when it has been laid for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour, so that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough.
10136-8{_}23058{_}Then place the pan on a strong chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milk-and-water; stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon; then wipe it out clean with your fingers, and lay it aside.
10136-8{_}23059{_}Next take plenty of the remaining flour, throw it on the top of the leaven, and begin, with the knuckles of both hands, to knead it well.
10136-8{_}23060{_}When the flour is nearly all kneaded in, begin to draw the edges of the dough towards the middle, in order to mix the whole thoroughly; and when it is free from flour and lumps and crumbs, and does not stick to the hands when touched, it will be done, and may again be covered with the cloth, and left to rise a second time.
10136-8{_}23061{_}In 3/4 hour look at it, and should it have swollen very much, and begin to crack, it will be light enough to bake.
10136-8{_}23062{_}Turn it then on to a paste-board or very clean dresser, and with a large sharp knife divide it in two; make it up quickly into loaves, and dispatch it to the oven: make one or two incisions across the tops of the loaves, as they will rise more easily if this be done.
10136-8{_}23063{_}If baked in tins or pans, rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent the dough from sticking to them.
10136-8{_}23064{_}All bread should be turned upside down, or on its side, as soon as it is drawn from the oven: if this be neglected, the under part of the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam, which cannot then escape from them.
10136-8{_}23065{_}_To make the dough without setting a sponge_, merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm milk-and-water, and wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little salt has been stirred in, proceeding exactly, in every other respect, as in the directions just given.
10136-8{_}23066{_}As the dough will _soften_ in the rising, it should be made quite firm at first, or it will be too lithe by the time it is ready for the oven.
10136-8{_}23067{_}[Illustration: ITALIAN MILLET.]
10136-8{_}23068{_}_Time_.--To be left to rise an hour the first time, 3/4 hour the second time; to be baked from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, or baked in one loaf from 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
10136-8{_}23069{_}ITALIAN MILLET, or Great Indian Millet, is cultivated in Egypt     and Nubia, where it is called _dhourra_, and is used as human     food, as well as for the fermentation of beer.
10136-8{_}23070{_}It will grow on     poor soils, and is extremely productive.
10136-8{_}23071{_}It has been introduced     into Italy, where they make a coarse bread from it; and it is     also employed in pastry and puddings: they also use it for     feeding horses and domestic fowls.
10136-8{_}23072{_}It is the largest variety,     growing to the height of six feet; but it requires a warm     climate, and will not ripen in this country.
10136-8{_}23073{_}A yellow variety,     called Golden Millet, is sold in the grocers' shops, for making     puddings, and is very delicate and wholesome.
10136-8{_}23074{_}TO MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BREAD.
10136-8{_}23075{_}1719.
10136-8{_}23076{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs.
10136-8{_}23077{_}of potatoes, 6 pints of cold water, 1/2 pint of good yeast, a peck of flour, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}23078{_}of salt.
10136-8{_}23079{_}_Mode_.--Peel and boil the potatoes; beat them to a cream while warm; then add 1 pint of cold water, strain through a colander, and add to it 1/2 pint of good yeast, which should have been put in water over-night, to take off its bitterness.
10136-8{_}23080{_}Stir all well together with a wooden spoon, and pour the mixture into the centre of the flour; mix it to the substance of cream, cover it over closely, and let it remain near the fire for an hour; then add the 5 pints of water, milk-warm, with 2 oz.
10136-8{_}23081{_}of salt; pour this in, and mix the whole to a nice light dough.
10136-8{_}23082{_}Let it remain for about 2 hours; then make it into 7 loaves, and bake for about 1-1/2 hour in a good oven.
10136-8{_}23083{_}When baked, the bread should weigh nearly 20 lbs.
10136-8{_}23084{_}_Time_.--About 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}23085{_}THE RED VARIETIES OF WHEAT are generally hardier and more easily     grown than the white sorts, and, although of less value to the     miller, they are fully more profitable to the grower, in     consequence of the better crops which they produce.
10136-8{_}23086{_}Another     advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity     from the attacks of mildew and fly.
10136-8{_}23087{_}The best English wheat comes     from the counties of Kent and Essex; the qualities under these     heads always bearing a higher price than others, as will be seen     by the periodical lists in the journals.
10136-8{_}23088{_}RICE BREAD.
10136-8{_}23089{_}1720.
10136-8{_}23090{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every lb.
10136-8{_}23091{_}of rice allow 4 lbs.
10136-8{_}23092{_}of wheat flour, nearly 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}23093{_}of salt.
10136-8{_}23094{_}_Mode_.--Boil the rice in water until it is quite tender; pour off the water, and put the rice, before it is cold, to the flour.
10136-8{_}23095{_}Mix these well together with the yeast, salt, and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth dough; let it rise by the side of the fire, then form it into loaves, and bake them from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according to their size.
10136-8{_}23096{_}If the rice is boiled in milk instead of water, it makes very delicious bread or cakes.
10136-8{_}23097{_}When boiled in this manner, it may be mixed with the flour without straining the liquid from it.
10136-8{_}23098{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.
10136-8{_}23099{_}INDIAN-CORN-FLOUR BREAD.
10136-8{_}23100{_}1721.
10136-8{_}23101{_}INGREDIENTS.--To 4 lbs.
10136-8{_}23102{_}of flour allow 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}23103{_}of Indian-corn flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 3 pints of warm water, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}23104{_}of salt.
10136-8{_}23105{_}_Mode_.--Mix the two flours well together, with the salt; make a hole in the centre, and stir the yeast up well with 1/2 pint of the warm water; put this into the middle of the flour, and mix enough of it with the yeast to make a thin batter; throw a little flour over the surface of this batter, cover the whole with a thick cloth, and set it to rise in a warm place.
10136-8{_}23106{_}When the batter has nicely risen, work the whole to a nice smooth dough, adding the water as required; knead it well, and mould the dough into loaves; let them rise for nearly 1/2 hour, then put them into a well-heated oven.
10136-8{_}23107{_}If made into 2 loaves, they will require from 1-1/2 to 2 hours baking.
10136-8{_}23108{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.
10136-8{_}23109{_}[Illustration: MAIZE PLANT.]
10136-8{_}23110{_}[Illustration: EAR OF MAIZE.]
10136-8{_}23111{_}MAIZE.--Next to wheat and rice, maize is the grain most used in     the nourishment of man.
10136-8{_}23112{_}In Asia, Africa, and America, it is the     principal daily food of a large portion of the population,     especially of the colonists.
10136-8{_}23113{_}In some of the provinces of France,     too, it is consumed in large quantities.
10136-8{_}23114{_}There are eight     varieties of the maize; the most productive is the maize of     Cusco.
10136-8{_}23115{_}The flour of maize is yellow, and it contains an oily     matter, which, when fresh, gives it an agreeable flavour and     odour; but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity.
10136-8{_}23116{_}If carried any distance, it should be stored away in air-tight     vessels.
10136-8{_}23117{_}An excellent soup is prepared with meat and     maize-flour.
10136-8{_}23118{_}The inhabitants of some countries, where wheat is     scarce, make, with maize and water, or milk and salt, a kind of     biscuit, which is pleasant in taste, but indigestible.
10136-8{_}23119{_}Some of     the preparations of maize-flour are very good, and, when     partaken in moderation, suitable food for almost everybody.
10136-8{_}23120{_}SODA BREAD.
10136-8{_}23121{_}1722.
10136-8{_}23122{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}23123{_}of flour allow 1 teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold milk.
10136-8{_}23124{_}_Mode_.--Let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest possible powder; then mix them well with the flour.
10136-8{_}23125{_}Dissolve the soda in the milk, and pour it several times from one basin to another, before adding it to the flour.
10136-8{_}23126{_}Work the whole quickly into a light dough, divide it into 2 loaves, and put them into a well-heated oven immediately, and bake for an hour.
10136-8{_}23127{_}Sour milk or buttermilk may be used, but then a little less acid will be needed.
10136-8{_}23128{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}23129{_}POLISH AND POMERANIAN WHEAT are accounted by authorities most     excellent.
10136-8{_}23130{_}Large raft-like barges convey this grain down the     rivers, from the interior of the country to the seaports.
10136-8{_}23131{_}This     corn is described as being white, hard, and thin-skinned; and it     yields a large quantity of flour, having a small proportion of     bran.
10136-8{_}23132{_}EXCELLENT ROLLS.
10136-8{_}23133{_}1723.

10136-8{_}23136{_}of butter, 1/4 pint of milk, 1 large teaspoonful of yeast, a little salt.
10136-8{_}23137{_}[Illustration: ROLLS.]
10136-8{_}23138{_}_Mode_.--Warm the butter in the milk, add to it the yeast and salt, and mix these ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}23139{_}Put the flour into a pan, stir in the above ingredients, and let the dough rise, covered in a warm place.
10136-8{_}23140{_}Knead it well, make it into rolls, let them rise again for a few minutes, and bake in a quick oven.
10136-8{_}23141{_}Richer rolls may be made by adding 1 or 2 eggs and a larger proportion of butter, and their appearance improved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little milk.
10136-8{_}23142{_}_Time_--1 lb.
10136-8{_}23143{_}of flour, divided into 6 rolls, from 15 to 20 minutes.
10136-8{_}23144{_}HOT ROLLS.
10136-8{_}23145{_}1724.
10136-8{_}23146{_}This dish, although very unwholesome and indigestible, is nevertheless a great favourite, and eaten by many persons.
10136-8{_}23147{_}As soon as the rolls come from the baker's, they should be put into the oven, which, in the early part of the morning, is sure not to be very hot; and the rolls must not be buttered until wanted.
10136-8{_}23148{_}When they are quite hot, divide them lengthwise into three; put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices, press the rolls together, and put them in the oven for a minute or two, but not longer, or the butter would oil; take them out of the oven, spread the butter equally over, divide the rolls in half, and put them on to a very hot clean dish, and send them instantly to table.
10136-8{_}23149{_}TO MAKE DRY TOAST.
10136-8{_}23150{_}1725.
10136-8{_}23151{_}To make dry toast properly, a great deal of attention is required; much more, indeed, than people generally suppose.
10136-8{_}23152{_}Never use new bread for making any kind of toast, as it eats heavy, and, besides, is very extravagant.
10136-8{_}23153{_}Procure a loaf of household bread about two days old; cut off as many slices as may be required, not quite 1/4 inch in thickness; trim off the crusts and ragged edges, put the bread on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear fire.
10136-8{_}23154{_}Move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured; then turn it and toast the other side, and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens.
10136-8{_}23155{_}Dry toast should be more gradually made than buttered toast, as its great beauty consists in its crispness, and this cannot be attained unless the process is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour.
10136-8{_}23156{_}It should never be made long before it is wanted, as it soon becomes tough, unless placed on the fender in front of the fire.
10136-8{_}23157{_}As soon as each piece is ready, it should be put into a rack, or stood upon its edges, and sent quickly to table.
10136-8{_}23158{_}TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST.
10136-8{_}23159{_}1726.
10136-8{_}23160{_}A loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread, the latter not being a good shape, and too crusty for the purpose.
10136-8{_}23161{_}Cut as many nice even slices as may be required, rather more than 1/4 inch in thickness, and toast them before a very bright fire, without allowing the bread to blacken, which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast.
10136-8{_}23162{_}When of a nice colour on both sides, put it on a hot plate; divide some good butter into small pieces, place them on the toast, set this before the fire, and when the butter is just beginning to melt, spread it lightly over the toast.
10136-8{_}23163{_}Trim off the crust and ragged edges, divide each round into 4 pieces, and send the toast quickly to table.
10136-8{_}23164{_}Some persons cut the slices of toast across from corner to corner, so making the pieces of a three-cornered shape.
10136-8{_}23165{_}Soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered, and when all are ready, that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on.
10136-8{_}23166{_}He says that by cutting through 4 or 5 slices at a time, all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones, while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid.
10136-8{_}23167{_}It is highly essential to use good butter for making this dish.
10136-8{_}23168{_}MUFFINS.
10136-8{_}23169{_}1727.
10136-8{_}23170{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of milk allow 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}23171{_}of German yeast, a little salt; flour.
10136-8{_}23172{_}[Illustration: MUFFINS.]
10136-8{_}23173{_}_Mode_.--Warm the milk, add to it the yeast, and mix these well together; put them into a pan, and stir in sufficient flour to make the whole into a dough of rather a soft consistence; cover it over with a cloth, and place it in a warm place to rise, and, when light and nicely risen, divide the dough into pieces, and round them to the proper shape with the hands; place them, in a layer of flour about two inches thick, on wooden trays, and let them rise again; when this is effected, they each will exhibit a semi-globular shape.
10136-8{_}23174{_}Then place them carefully on a hot-plate or stove, and bake them until they are slightly browned, turning them when they are done on one side.
10136-8{_}23175{_}Muffins are not easily made, and are more generally purchased than manufactured at home.
10136-8{_}23176{_}_To toast them_, divide the edge of the muffin all round, by pulling it open, to the depth of about an inch, with the fingers.
10136-8{_}23177{_}Put it on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear fire until one side is nicely browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other.
10136-8{_}23178{_}Do not toast them too quickly, as, if this is done, the middle of the muffin will not be warmed through.
10136-8{_}23179{_}When done, divide them by pulling them open; butter them slightly on both sides, put them together again, and cut them into halves: when sufficient are toasted and buttered, pile them on a very hot dish, and send them very quickly to table.
10136-8{_}23180{_}_Time_.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to bake them.
10136-8{_}23181{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 muffin to each person.

10136-8{_}23183{_}[Illustration: CRUMPETS.]
10136-8{_}23184{_}1728.
10136-8{_}23185{_}These are made in the same manner as muffins; only, in making the mixture, let it be more like batter than dough.
10136-8{_}23186{_}Let it rise for about 1/2 hour; pour it into iron rings, which should be ready on a hot-plate; bake them, and when one side appears done, turn them quickly on the other.
10136-8{_}23187{_}_To toast them_, have ready a very _bright clear_ fire; put the crumpet on a toasting-fork, and hold it before the fire, _not too close_, until it is nicely brown on one side, but do not allow it to blacken.
10136-8{_}23188{_}Turn it, and brown the other side; then spread it with good butter, cut it in half, and, when all are done, pile them on a hot dish, and send them quickly to table.
10136-8{_}23189{_}Muffins and crumpets should always be served on separate dishes, and both toasted and served as expeditiously as possible.
10136-8{_}23190{_}_Time_.--From 10 to 15 minutes to bake them.
10136-8{_}23191{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 crumpets to each person.

10136-8{_}23197{_}of butter, warm milk.
10136-8{_}23198{_}_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin, mix the sugar well with it, make a hole in the centre, and stir in the yeast and milk (which should be lukewarm), with enough of the flour to make it the thickness of cream.
10136-8{_}23199{_}Cover the basin over with a cloth, and let the sponge rise in a warm place, which will be accomplished in about 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}23200{_}Melt the butter, but do not allow it to oil; stir it into the other ingredients, with enough warm milk to make the whole into a soft dough; then mould it into buns about the size of an egg; lay them in rows quite 3 inches apart; set them again in a warm place, until they have risen to double their size; then put them into a good brisk oven, and just before they are done, wash them over with a little milk.
10136-8{_}23201{_}From 15 to 20 minutes will be required to bake them nicely.
10136-8{_}23202{_}These buns may be varied by adding a few currants, candied peel, or caraway seeds to the other ingredients; and the above mixture answers for hot cross buns, by putting in a little ground allspice; and by pressing a tin mould in the form of a cross in the centre of the bun.

10136-8{_}23704{_}CARBONATE OF SODA--Soda was called the mineral alkali, because     it was originally dug up out of the ground in Africa and other     countries: this state of carbonate of soda is called _natron._     But carbonate of soda is likewise procured from the combustion     of marine plants, or such as grow on the sea-shore.

10136-8{_}23707{_}A small pinch of carbonate of soda     will give an extraordinary lightness to puff pastes; and,     introduced into the teapot, will extract the full strength of     the tea.

10136-8{_}23876{_}BREAD-MAKING IN SPAIN.--The bread in the south of Spain is     delicious: it is white as snow, close as cake, and yet very     light; the flavour is most admirable, for the wheat is good and     pure, and the bread well kneaded.
10136-8{_}23877{_}The way they make this bread     is as follows:--From large round panniers filled with wheat they     take out a handful at a time, sorting it most carefully and     expeditiously, and throwing every defective grain into another     basket.
10136-8{_}23878{_}This done, the wheat is ground between two circular     stones, as it was ground in Egypt 2,000 years ago (see No.
10136-8{_}23879{_}117),     the requisite rotary motion being given by a blindfolded mule,     which paces round and round with untiring patience, a bell being     attached to his neck, which, as long as he is in movement,     tinkles on; and when it stops, he is urged to his duty by the     shout of "_Arre, mula_," from some one within hearing.
10136-8{_}23880{_}When     ground, the wheat is sifted through three sieves, the last of     these being so fine that only the pure flour can pass through     it: this is of a pale apricot-colour.
10136-8{_}23881{_}The bread is made in the     evening.
10136-8{_}23882{_}It is mixed with only sufficient water, with a little     salt in it, to make it into dough: a very small quantity of     leaven, or fermenting mixture is added.
10136-8{_}23883{_}The Scripture says, "A     little leaven leaveneth the whole lump;" but in England, to     avoid the trouble of kneading, many put as much leaven or yeast     in one batch of household bread as in Spain would last them a     week for the six or eight donkey-loads of bread they send every     night from their oven.
10136-8{_}23884{_}The dough made, it is put into sacks, and     carried on the donkeys' backs to the oven in the centre of the     village, so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded.
10136-8{_}23885{_}On arriving     there, the dough is divided into portions weighing 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}23886{_}each.
10136-8{_}23887{_}Two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down     the room; and now a curious sight may be seen.
10136-8{_}23888{_}About twenty men     (bakers) come in and range themselves on one side of the tables.
10136-8{_}23889{_}A lump of dough is handed to the nearest, which he commences     kneading and knocking about with all his might for about 3 or 4     minutes, and then passes it on to his neighbour, who does the     same; and so on successively until all have kneaded it, when it     becomes as soft as new putty, and ready for the oven.
10136-8{_}23890{_}Of course,     as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his     neighbour, another is given to him, and so on till the whole     quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all.
10136-8{_}23891{_}The     bakers' wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven, and     some of them are very small, and they are baked immediately.
10136-8{_}23892{_}The     ovens are very large, and not heated by fires _under_ them; but     a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme,     which cover the hills in great profusion, are put in the oven     and ignited.
10136-8{_}23893{_}They heat the oven to any extent required; and, as     the bread gets baked, the oven gets gradually colder; so the     bread is never burned.
10136-8{_}23894{_}They knead the bread in Spain with such     force, that the palm of the hand and the second joints of the     fingers of the bakers are covered with corns; and it so affects     the chest, that they cannot work more than two hours at a time.

10136-8{_}23935{_}of candied lemon-peel, ground allspice to taste.
10136-8{_}23936{_}_Mode_.--Cut the leaf, or flead, as it is sometimes called, into small pieces; put it into a large dish, which place in a quick oven; be careful that it does not burn, and in a short time it will be reduced to oil, with the small pieces of leaf floating on the surface; and it is of these that the cakes should be made.

10136-8{_}23940{_}These are very economical and wholesome cakes for children, and the lard, melted at home, produced from the flead, is generally better than that you purchase.
10136-8{_}23941{_}To prevent the lard from burning, and to insure its being a good colour, it is better to melt it in a jar placed in a saucepan of boiling water; by doing it in this manner, there will be no chance of its discolouring.

10136-8{_}23945{_}[Illustration: WHEAT.]
10136-8{_}23946{_}Wheat is liable to several diseases, which affect the flour made     from it, and render it unfit for good bread.
10136-8{_}23947{_}The principal of     these are the blight, mildew, and smut, which are occasioned by     microscopic fungi, which sow themselves and grow upon the stems     and ears, destroying the nutritive principles, and introducing     matter of a deleterious kind.
10136-8{_}23948{_}The farmer is at the utmost pains     to keep away these intruders.
10136-8{_}23949{_}Wheat, as well as all kinds of     corn, is also very liable to be injured by being stacked before     it is quite dry; in which case it will heat, and become musty in     the ricks.
10136-8{_}23950{_}In wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it     sufficiently dried, and a great deal of corn is thus often     spoiled.
10136-8{_}23951{_}It is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is     made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked; which shows     the importance of studying the best modes of preserving it.
10136-8{_}23952{_}The erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn:     some say it is Egypt, others Tartary; and the learned Bailly, as     well as the traveller Pallas, affirms that it grows     spontaneously in Siberia.
10136-8{_}23953{_}Be that as it may, the Phocians     brought it to Marseilles before the Romans had penetrated into     Gaul.
10136-8{_}23954{_}The Gauls ate the corn cooked or bruised in a mortar: they     did not know, for a long time, how to make fermented bread.

10136-8{_}23974{_}SODA-CAKE.
10136-8{_}23975{_}1781.
10136-8{_}23976{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}23977{_}of butter, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}23978{_}of flour, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23979{_}of currants, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}23980{_}of moist sugar, 1 teacupful of milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.
10136-8{_}23981{_}_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour, add the currants and sugar, and mix these ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}23982{_}Whisk the eggs well, stir them to the flour, &c., with the milk, in which the soda should be previously dissolved, and beat the whole up together with a wooden spoon or beater.
10136-8{_}23983{_}Divide the dough into two pieces, put them into buttered moulds or cake-tins, and bake in a moderate oven for nearly an hour.
10136-8{_}23984{_}The mixture must be extremely well beaten up, and not allowed to stand after the soda is added to it, but must be placed in the oven immediately.
10136-8{_}23985{_}Great care must also be taken that the cakes are quite done through, which may be ascertained by thrusting a knife into the middle of them: if the blade looks bright when withdrawn, they are done.
10136-8{_}23986{_}If the tops acquire too much colour before the inside is sufficiently baked, cover them over with a piece of clean white paper, to prevent them from burning.
10136-8{_}23987{_}_Time_.--1 hour.

10136-8{_}23994{_}INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 4 eggs in pounded loaf sugar, the weight of 7 in flour, a little grated lemon-rind, or essence of almonds, or orange-flower water.
10136-8{_}23995{_}_Mode_.--Break the 7 eggs, putting the yolks into one basin and the whites into another.
10136-8{_}23996{_}Whisk the former, and mix with them the sugar, the grated lemon-rind, or any other flavouring to taste; beat them well together, and add the whites of the eggs, whisked to a froth.
10136-8{_}23997{_}Put in the flour by degrees, continuing to beat the mixture for 1/4 hour, butter a mould, pour in the cake, and bake it from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}23998{_}This is a very nice cake for dessert, and may be iced for a supper-table, or cut into slices and spread with jam, which converts it into sandwiches.

10136-8{_}24008{_}_Mode_.--Put the eggs into one side of the scale, and take the weight of 8 in pounded loaf sugar, and the weight of 5 in good _dry_ flour.
10136-8{_}24009{_}Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former, put them into a saucepan with the sugar, and let them remain over the fire until _milk-warm,_ keeping them well stirred.
10136-8{_}24010{_}Then put them into a basin, add the grated lemon-rind mixed with the brandy, and stir these well together, dredging in the flour very gradually.
10136-8{_}24011{_}Whisk the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, stir them to the flour, &c., and beat the cake well for 1/4 hour.
10136-8{_}24012{_}Put it into a buttered mould strewn with a little fine sifted sugar, and bake the cake in a quick oven for 1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}24013{_}Care must be taken that it is put into the oven immediately, or it will not be light.
10136-8{_}24014{_}The flavouring of this cake may be varied by adding a few drops of essence of almonds instead of the grated lemon-rind.

10136-8{_}24021{_}The Egyptian, or Mummy Wheat, is not grown to any great extent,     owing to its inferior quality; but it is notable for its large     produce, and is often cultivated on allotment grounds and on     small farms, where quantity rather than quality is desired.
10136-8{_}24022{_}At     Wix, in Essex, the seed of this wheat has produced, without     artificial assistance, four thousandfold; some of the ears have     had eleven offshoots, and have contained, altogether, eleven     grains in one ear.

10136-8{_}24027{_}of flour, 1/4 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.
10136-8{_}24028{_}_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together until they form a thick syrup; let it cool a little, then pour it to the eggs, which should be previously well whisked; and after the eggs and syrup are mixed together, continue beating them for a few minutes.
10136-8{_}24029{_}Grate the lemon-rind, mix the carbonate of soda with the flour, and stir these lightly to the other ingredients; then add the lemon-juice, and, when the whole is thoroughly mixed, pour it into a buttered mould, and bake in rather a quick oven for rather more than 1 hour.
10136-8{_}24030{_}The remains of sponge or Savoy cakes answer very well for trifles, light puddings, &c.; and a very stale one (if not mouldy) makes an excellent tipsy-cake.

10136-8{_}24039{_}Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, and beat the latter up with the sugar; then whisk the whites until they become rather stiff, and mix them with the yolks, but do not stir them more than is just necessary to mingle the ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}24040{_}Dredge in the flour by degrees, add the flavouring; batter the tins well, pour in the batter, sift a little sugar over the cakes, and bake them in rather a quick oven, but do not allow them to take too much colour, as they should be rather pale.
10136-8{_}24041{_}Remove them from the tins before they get cold, and turn them on their faces, where let them remain until quite cold, when store them away in a closed tin canister or wide-mouthed glass bottle.

10136-8{_}24052{_}Let it rise near the fire, and, when well risen, form it into cakes; place them on tins, let them rise again for a few minutes before putting them into the oven, and bake from 1/4 to 1/2 hour in a moderate oven.
10136-8{_}24053{_}These are very nice with a few currants and a little sugar added to the other ingredients: they should be put in after the butter is rubbed in.
10136-8{_}24054{_}These cakes should be buttered, and eaten hot as soon as baked; but, when stale, they are very nice split and toasted; or, if dipped in milk, or even water, and covered with a basin in the oven till hot, they will be almost equal to new.

10136-8{_}24084{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEVERAGES.
10136-8{_}24085{_}1789.
10136-8{_}24086{_}Beverages are innumerable in their variety; but the ordinary beverages drunk in the British isles, may be divided into three classes:--1.
10136-8{_}24087{_}Beverages of the simplest kind not fermented.
10136-8{_}24088{_}2.
10136-8{_}24089{_}Beverages, consisting of water, containing a considerable quantity of carbonic acid.
10136-8{_}24090{_}3.
10136-8{_}24091{_}Beverages composed partly of fermented liquors.
10136-8{_}24092{_}Of the first class may be mentioned,--water, toast-and-water, barley-water, eau sucré, lait sucré, cheese and milk whey, milk-and-water, lemonade, orangeade, sherbet, apple and pear juice, capillaire, vinegar-and-water, raspberry vinegar and water.
10136-8{_}24093{_}1790.
10136-8{_}24094{_}Of the common class of beverages, consisting of water impregnated with carbonic acid gas, we may name soda-water, single and double, ordinary effervescing draughts, and ginger-beer.
10136-8{_}24095{_}1791.
10136-8{_}24096{_}The beverages composed partly of fermented liquors, are hot spiced wines, bishop, egg-flip, egg-hot, ale posset, sack posset, punch, and spirits-and-water.
10136-8{_}24097{_}1792.
10136-8{_}24098{_}We will, however, forthwith treat on the most popular of our beverages, beginning with the one which makes "the cup that cheers but not inebriates."
10136-8{_}24099{_}1793.
10136-8{_}24100{_}The beverage called tea has now become almost a necessary of life.
10136-8{_}24101{_}Previous to the middle of the 17th century it was not used in England, and it was wholly unknown to the Greeks and Romans.
10136-8{_}24102{_}Pepys says, in his Diary,--"September 25th, 1661.--I sent for a cup of tea (a China drink), of which I had never drunk before."
10136-8{_}24103{_}Two years later it was so rare a commodity in England, that the English East-India Company bought 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}24104{_}2 oz.
10136-8{_}24105{_}of it, as a present for his majesty.
10136-8{_}24106{_}In 1666 it was sold in London for sixty shillings a pound.
10136-8{_}24107{_}From that date the consumption has gone on increasing from 5,000 lbs.
10136-8{_}24108{_}to 50,000,000 lbs.
10136-8{_}24109{_}1794.
10136-8{_}24110{_}Linnaeus was induced to think that there were two species of tea-plant, one of which produced the black, and the other the green teas; but later observations do not confirm this.
10136-8{_}24111{_}When the leaves of black and green tea are expanded by hot water, and examined by the botanist, though a difference of character is perceived, yet this is not sufficient to authorize considering them as distinct species.
10136-8{_}24112{_}The tea-tree flourishes best in temperate regions; in China it is indigenous.
10136-8{_}24113{_}The part of China where the best tea is cultivated, is called by us the "tea country."
10136-8{_}24114{_}The cultivation of the plant requires great care.
10136-8{_}24115{_}It is raised chiefly on the sides of hills; and, in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves, the shrub is pruned, so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet, much in the same manner as the vine is treated in France.
10136-8{_}24116{_}They pluck the leaves, one selecting them according to the kinds of tea required; and, notwithstanding the tediousness of the operation, each labourer is able to gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day.
10136-8{_}24117{_}When the trees attain to six or seven years of age, the produce becomes so inferior that they are removed to make room for a fresh succession, or they are cut down to allow of numerous young shoots.
10136-8{_}24118{_}Teas of the finest flavour consist of the youngest leaves; and as these are gathered at four different periods of the year, the younger the leaves the higher flavoured the tea, and the scarcer, and consequently the dearer, the article.
10136-8{_}24119{_}1795.
10136-8{_}24120{_}The various names by which teas are sold in the British market are corruptions of Chinese words.
10136-8{_}24121{_}There are about a dozen different kinds; but the principal are Bohea, Congou, and Souchong, and signify, respectively, inferior, middling, and superior.
10136-8{_}24122{_}Teas are often perfumed and flavoured with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on purpose.
10136-8{_}24123{_}Different tea-farms in China produce teas of various qualities, raised by skilful cultivation on various soils.
10136-8{_}24124{_}1796.
10136-8{_}24125{_}Tea, when chemically analyzed, is found to contain woody fibre, mucilage, a considerable quantity of the astringent principle, or tannin, a narcotic principle, which is, perhaps, connected with a peculiar aroma.
10136-8{_}24126{_}The tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with sulphate of iron, and is the cause of the dark stain which is always formed when tea is spilt upon buff-coloured cottons dyed with iron.
10136-8{_}24127{_}A constituent called _Theine_ has also been discovered in tea, supposed to be identical with _Caffeine_, one of the constituents of coffee.
10136-8{_}24128{_}Liebig says, "Theine yields, in certain processes of decomposition, a series of most remarkable products, which have much analogy with those derived from uric acid in similar circumstances.
10136-8{_}24129{_}The infusion of tea differs from that of coffee, by containing iron and manganese.
10136-8{_}24130{_}We have in tea, of many kinds, a beverage which contains the active constituents of the most powerful mineral springs, and, however small the amount of iron may be which we daily take in this form, it cannot be destitute of influence on the vital processes."
10136-8{_}24131{_}1797.
10136-8{_}24132{_}Chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country, by the admixture of the dried leaves of certain plants.
10136-8{_}24133{_}The leaves of the sloe, white thorn, ash, elder, and some others, have been employed for this purpose; such as the leaves of the speedwell, wild germander, black currants, syringa, purple-spiked willow-herb, sweet-brier, and cherry-tree.
10136-8{_}24134{_}Some of these are harmless, others are to a certain degree poisonous; as, for example, are the leaves of all the varieties of the plum and cherry tribe, to which the sloe belongs.
10136-8{_}24135{_}Adulteration by means of these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud; and several acts of parliament, from the time of George II., have been passed, specifying severe penalties against those guilty of the offence, which, notwithstanding numerous convictions, continues to the present time.
10136-8{_}24136{_}1798.
10136-8{_}24137{_}In the purchase of tea, that should be chosen which possesses an agreeable odour and is as whole as possible, in order that the leaf may be easily examined.
10136-8{_}24138{_}The greatest care should be taken that it has not been exposed to the air, which destroys its flavour.
10136-8{_}24139{_}1799.
10136-8{_}24140{_}It would be impossible, in the space at our command, to enumerate the various modes adopted in different countries for "making coffee;" that is, the phrase commonly understood to mean the complete preparation of this delicious beverage for drinking.
10136-8{_}24141{_}For performing this operation, such recipes or methods as we have found most practical will be inserted in their proper place; but the following facts connected with coffee will be found highly interesting.
10136-8{_}24142{_}1800.
10136-8{_}24143{_}The introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of recent date.
10136-8{_}24144{_}We are assured by Bruce that the coffee-tree is a native of Abyssinia, and it is said to have been cultivated in that country from time immemorial.
10136-8{_}24145{_}1801.
10136-8{_}24146{_}It appears that coffee was first introduced into England by Daniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, whose servant, Pasqua, a Greek, understood the manner of roasting it.
10136-8{_}24147{_}This servant, under the patronage of Edwards, established the first coffee-house in London, in George Yard, Lombard Street.
10136-8{_}24148{_}Coffee was then sold at four or five guineas a pound, and a duty was soon afterwards laid upon it of fourpence a gallon, when made into a beverage.
10136-8{_}24149{_}In the course of two centuries, however, this berry, unknown originally as an article of food, except to some savage tribes on the confines of Abyssinia, has made its way through the whole of the civilized world.
10136-8{_}24150{_}Mahommedans of all ranks drink coffee twice a day; it is in universal request in France; and the demand for it throughout the British isles is daily increasing, the more especially since so much attention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and grinding the berry and preparing the beverage.
10136-8{_}24151{_}1802.
10136-8{_}24152{_}Of the various kinds of coffee the Arabian is considered the best.
10136-8{_}24153{_}It is grown chiefly in the districts of Aden and Mocha; whence the name of our Mocha coffee.
10136-8{_}24154{_}Mocha coffee has a smaller and rounder bean than any other, and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste.
10136-8{_}24155{_}The next in reputation and quality is the Java and Ceylon coffee, and then the coffees of Bourbon and Martinique, and that of Berbice, a district of the colony of British Guiana.
10136-8{_}24156{_}The Jamaica and St. Domingo coffees are less esteemed.
10136-8{_}24157{_}1803.
10136-8{_}24158{_}A considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the constituents of coffee by the application of heat in roasting it.
10136-8{_}24159{_}Independently of one of the objects of roasting, namely, that of destroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground, its tannin and other principles are rendered partly soluble in water; and it is to the tannin that the brown colour of the decoction of coffee is owing.
10136-8{_}24160{_}An aromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction, which is not perceived in the raw berry, and which is not produced in the greatest perfection until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of temperature; but, if the heat be increased beyond this, the flavour is again dissipated, and little remains but a bitter and astringent matter with carbon.
10136-8{_}24161{_}1804.
10136-8{_}24162{_}The roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety, and much of the qualities of the beverage depends upon the operation.
10136-8{_}24163{_}The roasting of coffee for the dealers in London and Paris has now become a separate branch of business, and some of the roasters perform the operation on a great scale, with considerable skill.
10136-8{_}24164{_}Roasted coffee loses from 20 to 30 per cent, by sufficient roasting, and the powder suffers much by exposure to the air; but, while raw, it not only does not lose its flavour for a year or two, but improves by keeping.
10136-8{_}24165{_}If a cup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot, it will fill the room with its fragrance; but the coffee, when warmed again after being cold, will be found to have lost most of its flavour.
10136-8{_}24166{_}1805.
10136-8{_}24167{_}To have coffee in perfection, it should be roasted and ground just before it is used, and more should not be ground at a time than is wanted for immediate use, or, if it be necessary to grind more, it should be kept closed from the air.
10136-8{_}24168{_}Coffee readily imbibes exhalations from other substances, and thus often acquires a bad flavour: brown sugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable flavour.
10136-8{_}24169{_}It is stated that the coffee in the West Indies has often been injured by being laid in rooms near the sugar-works, or where rum is distilled; and the same effect has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same ships with rum and sugar.
10136-8{_}24170{_}Dr. Moseley mentions that a few bags of pepper, on board a ship from India, spoiled a whole cargo of coffee.
10136-8{_}24171{_}1806.
10136-8{_}24172{_}With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction, much depends upon the taste of the consumer.
10136-8{_}24173{_}The greatest and most common fault in English coffee is the too small quantity of the ingredient.
10136-8{_}24174{_}Count Rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking after dinner, a pound of good Mocha coffee, which, when roasted and ground, weighs only thirteen ounces, serves to make fifty-six full cups, or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffee-cup of moderate size.

10136-8{_}24179{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}24180{_}of chocolate to each person; to every oz.
10136-8{_}24181{_}allow 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 pint of milk.
10136-8{_}24182{_}_Mode_.--Make the milk-and-water hot; scrape the chocolate into it, and stir the mixture constantly and quickly until the chocolate is dissolved; bring it to the boiling-point, stir it well, and serve directly with white sugar.
10136-8{_}24183{_}Chocolate prepared with in a mill, as shown in the engraving, is made by putting in the scraped chocolate, pouring over it the boiling milk-and-water, and milling it over the fire until hot and frothy.
10136-8{_}24184{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}24185{_}of cake chocolate to each person.
10136-8{_}24186{_}[Illustration: MILL.]
10136-8{_}24187{_}CHOCOLATE AND COCOA.--Both these preparations are made from the     seeds or beans of the cacao-tree, which grows in the West Indies     and South America.
10136-8{_}24188{_}The Spanish, and the proper name, is cacao,     not cocoa, as it is generally spelt.
10136-8{_}24189{_}From this mistake, the tree     from which the beverage is procured has been often confounded     with the palm that produces the edible cocoa-nuts, which are the     produce of the cocoa-tree (_Cocos nucifera_), whereas the tree     from which chocolate is procured is very different (the     _Theobroma cacao_).
10136-8{_}24190{_}The cocoa-tree was cultivated by the     aboriginal inhabitants of South America, particularly in Mexico,     where, according to Humboldt, it was reared by Montezuma.
10136-8{_}24191{_}It was     transplanted thence into other dependencies of the Spanish     monarchy in 1520; and it was so highly esteemed by Linnaeus     receive from him the name now conferred upon it, of Theobroma, a     term derived from the Greek, and signifying "_food for gods_."
10136-8{_}24192{_}Chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the     Spaniards and Creoles, and was considered here as a great luxury     when first introduced, after the discovery of America; but the     high duties laid upon it, confined it long almost entirely to     the wealthier classes.
10136-8{_}24193{_}Before it was subjected to duty, Mr.     Bryan Edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in     Jamaica, but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin.
10136-8{_}24194{_}The     removal of this duty has increased their cultivation.

10136-8{_}24197{_}TO MAKE ESSENCE OF COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24198{_}1808.
10136-8{_}24199{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}24200{_}of ground coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of powdered chicory, 3 small teacupfuls, or 1 pint, of water.
10136-8{_}24201{_}_Mode_.--Let the coffee be freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly roasted; put it into a percolater, or filter, with the chicory, and pour _slowly_ over it the above proportion of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24202{_}When it has all filtered through, warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil; then filter it a second time, put it into a clean and dry bottle, cork it well, and it will remain good for several days.
10136-8{_}24203{_}Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk.
10136-8{_}24204{_}This essence will be found particularly useful to those persons who have to rise extremely early; and having only the milk to make boiling, is very easily and quickly prepared.
10136-8{_}24205{_}When the essence is bottled, pour another 3 tea-cupfuls of _boiling_ water slowly on the grounds, which, when filtered through, will be a very weak coffee.
10136-8{_}24206{_}The next time there is essence to be prepared, make this weak coffee boiling, and pour it on the ground coffee instead of plain water: by this means a better coffee will be obtained.
10136-8{_}24207{_}Never throw away the grounds without having made use of them in this manner; and always cork the bottle well that contains this preparation, until the day that it is wanted for making the fresh essence.
10136-8{_}24208{_}_Time_.--To be filtered once, then brought to the boiling-point, and filtered again.
10136-8{_}24209{_}_Average cost_, with coffee at 1s.

10136-8{_}24212{_}_Sufficient'_-Allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk.
10136-8{_}24213{_}TO ROAST COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24214{_}(_A French Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}24215{_}1809.
10136-8{_}24216{_}It being an acknowledged fact that French coffee is decidedly superior to that made in England, and as the roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavour of the preparation, it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage these things in France.
10136-8{_}24217{_}In Paris, there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their coffee,--_La Maison Corcellet_ and _La Maison Royer de Chartres_; and to obtain this flavour, before roasting they add to every 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}24218{_}of coffee a piece of butter the size of a nut, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar: it is then roasted in the usual manner.
10136-8{_}24219{_}The addition of the butter and sugar develops the flavour and aroma of the berry; but it must be borne in mind, that the quality of the butter must be of the very best description.
10136-8{_}24220{_}TO MAKE COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24221{_}1810.
10136-8{_}24222{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 4 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of ground coffee to each person; to every oz.
10136-8{_}24223{_}of coffee allow 1/3 pint of water.
10136-8{_}24224{_}_Mode_.--To make coffee good, _it should never be boiled_, but the boiling water merely poured on it, the same as for tea.
10136-8{_}24225{_}The coffee should always be purchased in the berry,--if possible, freshly roasted; and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use.
10136-8{_}24226{_}There are very many new kinds of coffee-pots, but the method of making the coffee is nearly always the same; namely, pouring the boiling water on the powder, and allowing it to filter through.
10136-8{_}24227{_}Our illustration shows one of Loysel's Hydrostatic Urns, which are admirably adapted for making good and clear coffee, which should be made in the following, manner:--Warm the urn with boiling water, remove the lid and movable filter, and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the urn.
10136-8{_}24228{_}Put the movable filter over this, and screw the lid, inverted, tightly on the end of the centre pipe.
10136-8{_}24229{_}Pour into the inverted lid the above proportion of boiling water, and when all the water so poured has disappeared from the funnel, and made its way down the centre pipe and up again through the ground coffee by _hydrostatic pressure_, unscrew screw the lid and cover the urn.
10136-8{_}24230{_}Pour back direct into the urn, _not through the funnel_, one, two, or three cups, according to the size of the percolater, in order to make the infusion of uniform strength; the contents will then be ready for use, and should run from the tap strong, hot, and clear.
10136-8{_}24231{_}The coffee made in these urns generally turns out very good, and there is but one objection to them,--the coffee runs rather slowly from the tap.
10136-8{_}24232{_}This is of no consequence where there is a small party, but tedious where there are many persons to provide for.
10136-8{_}24233{_}A remedy for this objection may be suggested; namely, to make the coffee very strong, so that not more than 1/3 of a cup would be required, as the rest would be filled up with milk.
10136-8{_}24234{_}Making coffee in filters or percolaters does away with the necessity of using isinglass, white of egg, and various other preparations to clear it.
10136-8{_}24235{_}Coffee should always be served very hot, and, if possible, in the same vessel in which it is made, as pouring it from one pot to another cools, and consequently spoils it.
10136-8{_}24236{_}Many persons may think that the proportion of water we have given for each oz.
10136-8{_}24237{_}of coffee is rather small; it is so, and the coffee produced from it will be very strong; 1/3 of a cup will be found quite sufficient, which should be filled with nice hot milk, or milk and cream mixed.
10136-8{_}24238{_}This is the 'cafe au lait' for which our neighbours over the Channel are so justly celebrated.
10136-8{_}24239{_}Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred, use double the quantity of water, and, in pouring it into the cups, put in more coffee and less milk.
10136-8{_}24240{_}[Illustration: LOYSEL'S HYDROSTATIC URN.]
10136-8{_}24241{_}_Sufficient_.--For very good coffee, allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, to each person.
10136-8{_}24242{_}A VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24243{_}1811.
10136-8{_}24244{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of coffee to each person; to every oz.
10136-8{_}24245{_}allow 1 pint of water.
10136-8{_}24246{_}_Mode_.--Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin).
10136-8{_}24247{_}Fit the bag into the pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table.
10136-8{_}24248{_}Making it in this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which cools and spoils it.
10136-8{_}24249{_}The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so that the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that none of the grounds may escape through the seams, and so make the coffee thick and muddy.
10136-8{_}24250{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 tablespoonful, or 1/2 oz., to each person.
10136-8{_}24251{_}[Illustration: COFFEE.]
10136-8{_}24252{_}THE COFFEE PLANT grows to the height of about twelve or fifteen     feet, with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel,     although more pointed, and not so dry and thick.
10136-8{_}24253{_}The blossoms     are white, much like those of jasmine, and issue from the angles     of the leaf-stalks.
10136-8{_}24254{_}When the flowers fade, they are succeeded by     the coffee-bean, or seed, which is inclosed in a berry of a red     colour, when ripe resembling a cherry.
10136-8{_}24255{_}The coffee-beans are     prepared by exposing them to the sun for a few days, that the     pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture.
10136-8{_}24256{_}They     are then gradually dried for about three weeks, and put into a     mill to separate the husk from the seed.
10136-8{_}24257{_}CAFE AU LAIT.
10136-8{_}24258{_}1812.
10136-8{_}24259{_}This is merely very strong coffee added to a large proportion of good hot milk; about 6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee being quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of milk.
10136-8{_}24260{_}Of the essence No.
10136-8{_}24261{_}1808, which answers admirably for 'cafe an lait', so much would not be required.
10136-8{_}24262{_}This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery coffee so often served at English tables.
10136-8{_}24263{_}A little cream mixed with the milk, if the latter cannot be depended on for richness, improves the taste of the coffee, as also the richness of the beverage.
10136-8{_}24264{_}_Sufficient_.--6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuls of the essence, to a breakfast-cupful of milk.
10136-8{_}24265{_}TEA AND COFFEE.--It is true, says Liebig, that thousands have     lived without a knowledge of tea and coffee; and daily     experience teaches us that, under certain circumstances, they     may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal     functions; but it is an error, certainly, to conclude from this     that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their     effects; and it is a question whether, if we had no tea and no     coffee, the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the     means of replacing them.
10136-8{_}24266{_}Science, which accuses us of so much in     these respects, will have, in the first place, to ascertain     whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merely,     that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means     of acting on the nervous life, from the shore of the Pacific,     where the Indian retires from life for days in order to enjoy     the bliss of intoxication with koko, to the Arctic regions,     where Kamtschatdales and Koriakes prepare an intoxicating     beverage from a poisonous mushroom.
10136-8{_}24267{_}We think it, on the     contrary, highly probable, not to say certain, that the instinct     of man, feeling certain blanks, certain wants of the intensified     life of our times, which cannot be satisfied or filled up by     mere quantity, has discovered, in these products of vegetable     life the true means of giving to his food the desired and     necessary quality.
10136-8{_}24268{_}CAFE NOIR.
10136-8{_}24269{_}1813.
10136-8{_}24270{_}This is usually handed round after dinner, and should be drunk well sweetened, with the addition of a little brandy or liqueurs, which may be added or not at pleasure.
10136-8{_}24271{_}The coffee should be made very strong, and served in very small cups, but never mixed with milk or cream.
10136-8{_}24272{_}Cafe noir may be made of the essence of coffee No.
10136-8{_}24273{_}1808, by pouring a tablespoonful into each cup, and filling it up with boiling water.
10136-8{_}24274{_}This is a very simple and expeditious manner of preparing coffee for a large party, but the essence for it must be made very good, and kept well corked until required for use.
10136-8{_}24275{_}TO MAKE TEA.
10136-8{_}24276{_}1814.
10136-8{_}24277{_}There is very little art in making good tea; if the water is boiling, and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf, the beverage will almost invariably be good.
10136-8{_}24278{_}The old-fashioned plan of allowing a teaspoonful to each person, and one over, is still practised.
10136-8{_}24279{_}Warm the teapot with boiling water; let it remain for two or three minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly hot, then pour it away.
10136-8{_}24280{_}Put in the tea, pour in from 1/2 to 3/4 pint of boiling water, close the lid, and let it stand for the tea to draw from 5 to 10 minutes; then fill up the pot with water.
10136-8{_}24281{_}The tea will be quite spoiled unless made with water that is actually 'boiling', as the leaves will not open, and the flavour not be extracted from them; the beverage will consequently be colourless and tasteless,--in fact, nothing but tepid water.
10136-8{_}24282{_}Where there is a very large party to make tea for, it is a good plan to have two teapots instead of putting a large quantity of tea into one pot; the tea, besides, will go farther.
10136-8{_}24283{_}When the infusion has been once completed, the addition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength; so, when more is required, have the pot emptied of the old leaves, scalded, and fresh tea made in the usual manner.
10136-8{_}24284{_}Economists say that a few grains of carbonate of soda, added before the boiling water is poured on the tea, assist to draw out the goodness: if the water is very hard, perhaps it is a good plan, as the soda softens it; but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly, as it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quantity.
10136-8{_}24285{_}For mixed tea, the usual proportion is four spoonfuls of black to one of green; more of the latter when the flavour is very much liked; but strong green tea is highly pernicious, and should never be partaken of too freely.
10136-8{_}24286{_}_Time_.--2 minutes to warm the teapot, 5 to 10 minutes to draw the strength from the tea.
10136-8{_}24287{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 teaspoonful to each person, and one over.
10136-8{_}24288{_}TEA.--The tea-tree or shrub belongs to the class and order of     Monadelphia polyandria in the Linnaean system, and to the     natural order of Aurantiaceae in the system of Jussieu.
10136-8{_}24289{_}Lately     it has been made into a new order, the Theasia, which includes     the Camellia and some other plants.
10136-8{_}24290{_}It commonly grows to the     height of from three to six feet; but it is said, that, in its     wild or native state, it reaches twenty feet or more.
10136-8{_}24291{_}In China     it is cultivated in numerous small plantations.
10136-8{_}24292{_}In its general     appearance, and the form of its leaf, it resembles the myrtle.
10136-8{_}24293{_}The blossoms are white and fragrant, not unlike those of the     wild rose, but smaller; and they are succeeded by soft green     capsules, containing each from one to three white seeds.
10136-8{_}24294{_}These     capsules are crushed for oil, which is in general use in China.

10136-8{_}24296{_}AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK OR CREAM IN TEA OR COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24297{_}1815.
10136-8{_}24298{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1 new-laid egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.
10136-8{_}24299{_}_Mode_.--Beat up the whole of the egg in a basin, put it into a cup (or a portion of it, if the cup be small), and pour over it the tea or coffee very hot.
10136-8{_}24300{_}These should be added very gradually, and stirred all the time, to prevent the egg from curdling.
10136-8{_}24301{_}In point of nourishment, both these beverages are much improved by this addition.
10136-8{_}24302{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.
10136-8{_}24303{_}TO MAKE COCOA.
10136-8{_}24304{_}1816.
10136-8{_}24305{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 2 teaspoonfuls of the prepared cocoa to 1 breakfast-cup; boiling milk and boiling water.
10136-8{_}24306{_}[Illustration: COCOA-BEAN.]
10136-8{_}24307{_}_Mode_.--Put the cocoa into a breakfast-cup, pour over it sufficient cold milk to make it into a smooth paste; then add equal quantities of boiling milk and boiling water, and stir all well together.
10136-8{_}24308{_}Care must be taken not to allow the milk to get burnt, as it will entirely spoil the flavour of the preparation.
10136-8{_}24309{_}The above directions are usually given for making the prepared cocoa.
10136-8{_}24310{_}The rock cocoa, or that bought in a solid piece, should be scraped, and made in the same manner, taking care to rub down all the lumps before the boiling liquid is added.
10136-8{_}24311{_}_Sufficient_--2 teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa for 1 breakfast-cup, or 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}24312{_}of the rock cocoa for the same quantity.

10136-8{_}24332{_}To every 9 gallons of wine 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of fresh brewer's yeast.
10136-8{_}24333{_}_Mode_.--Pour the water, quite boiling, on the elderberries, which should be picked from the stalks, and let these stand covered for 24 hours; then strain the whole through a sieve or bag, breaking the fruit to express all the juice from it.
10136-8{_}24334{_}Measure the liquor, and to every gallon allow the above proportion of sugar.
10136-8{_}24335{_}Boil the juice and sugar with the ginger, cloves, and raisins for 1 hour, skimming the liquor the whole time; let it stand until milk-warm, then put it into a clean dry cask, with 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of good fresh yeast to every 9 gallons of wine.
10136-8{_}24336{_}Let it ferment for about a fortnight; then add the brandy, bung up the cask, and let it stand some months before it is bottled, when it will be found excellent.

10136-8{_}24344{_}[Illustration: ELDER-BERRIES.]
10136-8{_}24345{_}ELDER-BERRY WINE.--The elder-berry is well adapted for the     production of wine; its juice contains a considerable portion of     the principle necessary for a vigorous fermentation, and its     beautiful colour communicates a rich tint to the wine made from     it.
10136-8{_}24346{_}It is, however, deficient in sweetness, and therefore     demands an addition of sugar.
10136-8{_}24347{_}It is one of the very best of the     genuine old English wines; and a cup of it mulled, just previous     to retiring to bed on a winter night, is a thing to be "run     for," as Cobbett would say: it is not, however, agreeable to     every taste.
10136-8{_}24348{_}GINGER WINE.
10136-8{_}24349{_}1819.
10136-8{_}24350{_}INGREDIENTS.--To 9 gallons of water allow 27 lbs.
10136-8{_}24351{_}of loaf sugar, 9 lemons, 12 oz.
10136-8{_}24352{_}of bruised ginger, 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}24353{_}of raisins stoned and chopped, 1 pint of brandy.
10136-8{_}24354{_}_Mode_.--Boil together for 1 hour in a copper (let it previously be well scoured and beautifully clean) the water, sugar, _lemon-rinds_, and bruised ginger; remove every particle of scum as it rises, and when the liquor is sufficiently boiled, put it into a large tub or pan, as it must not remain in the copper.
10136-8{_}24355{_}When nearly cold, add the yeast, which must be thick and very fresh, and, the next day, put all in a dry cask with the strained lemon-juice and chopped raisins.
10136-8{_}24356{_}Stir the wine every day for a fortnight; then add the brandy, stop the cask down by degrees, and in a few weeks it will be fit to bottle.
10136-8{_}24357{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}24358{_}per gallon.
10136-8{_}24359{_}_Sufficient_ to make 9 gallons of wine.
10136-8{_}24360{_}_Seasonable_.--The best time for making this wine is either in March or September.
10136-8{_}24361{_}_Note_.--Wine made early in March will be fit to bottle in June.
10136-8{_}24362{_}GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR.
10136-8{_}24363{_}(_An Excellent Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}24364{_}1820.
10136-8{_}24365{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 pecks of crystal gooseberries, 6 gallons of water, 12 lbs.
10136-8{_}24366{_}of foots sugar of the coarsest brown quality.
10136-8{_}24367{_}_Mode_.--Mash the gooseberries (which should be quite ripe) in a tub with a mallet; put to them the water nearly milk-warm; let this stand 24 hours; then strain it through a sieve, and put the sugar to it; mix it well, and tun it.
10136-8{_}24368{_}These proportions are for a 9-gallon cask; and if it be not quite full, more water must be added.
10136-8{_}24369{_}Let the mixture be stirred from the bottom of the cask two or three times daily for three or four days, to assist the melting of the sugar; then paste a piece of linen cloth over the bunghole, and set the cask in a warm place, _but not in the sun_; any corner of a warm kitchen is the best situation for it.
10136-8{_}24370{_}The following spring it should be drawn off into stone bottles, and the vinegar will be fit for use twelve months after it is made.
10136-8{_}24371{_}This will be found a most excellent preparation, greatly superior to much that is sold under the name of the best white wine vinegar.
10136-8{_}24372{_}Many years' experience has proved that pickle made with this vinegar will keep, when bought vinegar will not preserve the ingredients.
10136-8{_}24373{_}The cost per gallon is merely nominal, especially to those who reside in the country and grow their own gooseberries; the coarse sugar is then the only ingredient to be purchased.
10136-8{_}24374{_}_Time_.--To remain in the cask 9 months.
10136-8{_}24375{_}_Average cost_, when the gooseberries have to be purchased, 1s.
10136-8{_}24376{_}per gallon; when they are grown at home, 6d.
10136-8{_}24377{_}per gallon.
10136-8{_}24378{_}_Seasonable_.--This should be made the end of June or the beginning of July, when gooseberries are ripe and plentiful.
10136-8{_}24379{_}EFFERVESCING GOOSEBERRY WINE.
10136-8{_}24380{_}1821.
10136-8{_}24381{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every gallon of water allow 6 lbs.
10136-8{_}24382{_}of green gooseberries, 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}24383{_}of lump sugar.
10136-8{_}24384{_}_Mode_.--This wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries, in order to avoid the flavour which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature state.
10136-8{_}24385{_}Its briskness depends more upon the time of bottling than upon the unripe state of the fruit, for effervescing wine can be made from fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe.
10136-8{_}24386{_}The fruit should be selected when it has nearly attained its full growth, and consequently before it shows any tendency to ripen.
10136-8{_}24387{_}Any bruised or decayed berries, and those that are very small, should be rejected.
10136-8{_}24388{_}The blossom and stalk ends should be removed, and the fruit well bruised in a tub or pan, in such quantities as to insure each berry being broken without crushing the seeds.
10136-8{_}24389{_}Pour the water (which should be warm) on the fruit, squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is removed from the skin and seeds, and cover the whole closely for 24 hours; after which, strain it through a coarse bag, and press it with as much force as can be conveniently applied, to extract the whole of the juice and liquor the fruit may contain.
10136-8{_}24390{_}To every 40 or 50 lbs.
10136-8{_}24391{_}of fruit one gallon more of hot water may be passed through the marc, or husks, in order to obtain any soluble matter that may remain, and be again pressed.
10136-8{_}24392{_}The juice should be put into a tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all of it, and the sugar added to it.
10136-8{_}24393{_}Let it be well stirred until the sugar is dissolved, and place the pan in a warm situation; keep it closely covered, and let it ferment for a day or two.
10136-8{_}24394{_}It must then be drawn off into clean casks, placed a little on one side for the scum that arises to be thrown out, and the casks kept filled with the remaining "must," that should be reserved for that purpose.
10136-8{_}24395{_}When the active fermentation has ceased, the casks should be plugged upright, again filled, if necessary, the bungs be put in loosely, and, after a few days, when the fermentation is a little more languid (which may be known, by the hissing noise ceasing), the bungs should be driven in tight, and a spile-hole made, to give vent if necessary.
10136-8{_}24396{_}About November or December, on a clear fine day, the wine should he racked from its lees into clean casks, which may be rinsed with brandy.
10136-8{_}24397{_}After a month, it should be examined to see if it is sufficiently clear for bottling; if not, it must be fined with isinglass, which may be dissolved in some of the wine: 1 oz.
10136-8{_}24398{_}will be sufficient for 9 gallons.
10136-8{_}24399{_}In March or April, or when the gooseberry bushes begin to blossom, the wine must be bottled, in order to insure its being effervescing.
10136-8{_}24400{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this the end of May or beginning of June, before the berries ripen.
10136-8{_}24401{_}LEMON SYRUP.
10136-8{_}24402{_}1822.
10136-8{_}24403{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs.
10136-8{_}24404{_}of loaf sugar, 2 pints of water, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}24405{_}of citric acid, 12 drachm of essence of lemon.
10136-8{_}24406{_}_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, and put it into a basin, where let it remain till cold.
10136-8{_}24407{_}Beat the citric acid to a powder, mix the essence of lemon with it, then add these two ingredients to the syrup; mix well, and bottle for use.
10136-8{_}24408{_}Two tablespoonfuls of the syrup are sufficient for a tumbler of cold water, and will be found a very refreshing summer drink.
10136-8{_}24409{_}_Sufficient_--2 tablespoonfuls of syrup to a tumbler-ful of cold water.
10136-8{_}24410{_}LEMON WINE.
10136-8{_}24411{_}1823.
10136-8{_}24412{_}INGREDIENTS.--To 4-1/2 gallons of water allow the pulp of 50 lemons, the rind of 25, 16 lbs.
10136-8{_}24413{_}of loaf sugar,--1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}24414{_}of isinglass, 1 bottle of brandy.
10136-8{_}24415{_}_Mode_.--Peel and slice the lemons, but use only the rind of 25 of them, and put them into the cold water.
10136-8{_}24416{_}Let it stand 8 or 9 days, squeezing the lemons well every day; then strain the water off and put it into a cask with the sugar.
10136-8{_}24417{_}Let it work some time, and when it has ceased working, put in the isinglass.
10136-8{_}24418{_}Stop the cask down; in about six months put in the brandy and bottle the wine off.
10136-8{_}24419{_}_Seasonable_.--The best time to make this is in January or February, when lemons are best and cheapest.
10136-8{_}24420{_}MALT WINE.
10136-8{_}24421{_}1824.
10136-8{_}24422{_}INGREDIENTS.--5 gallons of water, 28 lbs.
10136-8{_}24423{_}of sugar, 6 quarts of sweet-wort, 6 quarts of tun, 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}24424{_}of raisins, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}24425{_}of candy, 1 pint of brandy.
10136-8{_}24426{_}_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; skim it well, and put the liquor into a convenient-sized pan or tub.
10136-8{_}24427{_}Allow it to cool; then mix it with the sweet-wort and tun.
10136-8{_}24428{_}Let it stand for 3 days, then put it into a barrel; here it will work or ferment for another three days or more; then bung up the cask, and keep it undisturbed for 2 or 3 months.
10136-8{_}24429{_}After this, add the raisins (whole), the candy, and brandy, and, in 6 months' time, bottle the wine off.
10136-8{_}24430{_}Those who do not brew, may procure the sweet-wort and tun from any brewer.
10136-8{_}24431{_}Sweet-wort is the liquor that leaves the mash of malt before it is boiled with the hops; tun is the new beer after the whole of the brewing operation has been completed.
10136-8{_}24432{_}_Time_.--To be boiled 10 minutes; to stand 3 days after mixing; to ferment 3 days; to remain in the cask 2 mouths before the raisins are added; bottle 6 months after.
10136-8{_}24433{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in March or October.
10136-8{_}24434{_}HOME-MADE NOYEAU.
10136-8{_}24435{_}1825.
10136-8{_}24436{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 oz.

10136-8{_}24438{_}of sweet ditto, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24439{_}of loaf sugar, the rinds of 3 lemons, 1 quart of Irish whiskey or gin, 1 tablespoonful of clarified honey, 4 pint of new milk.
10136-8{_}24440{_}_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds, and mix with them the sugar, which should also be pounded.
10136-8{_}24441{_}Boil the milk; let it stand till quite cold; then mix all the ingredients together, and let them remain for 10 days, shaking them every day.
10136-8{_}24442{_}Filter the mixture through blotting-paper, bottle off for use in small bottles, and seal the corks down.
10136-8{_}24443{_}This will be found useful for flavouring many sweet dishes.
10136-8{_}24444{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}24445{_}9d.
10136-8{_}24446{_}_Sufficient_ to make about 24 pints of Noyeau.
10136-8{_}24447{_}_Seasonable_.--May be made at any time.
10136-8{_}24448{_}ORANGE BRANDY.
10136-8{_}24449{_}(_Excellent_.)
10136-8{_}24450{_}1826.
10136-8{_}24451{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 1 gallon of brandy allow 3/4 pint of Seville orange-juice, 1-1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}24452{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}24453{_}_Mode_.--To bring out the full flavour of the orange-peel, rub a few lumps of the sugar on 2 or 3 unpared oranges, and put these lumps to the rest.
10136-8{_}24454{_}Mix the brandy with the orange-juice, strained, the rinds of 6 of the oranges pared very thin, and the sugar.
10136-8{_}24455{_}Let all stand in a closely-covered jar for about 3 days, stirring it 3 or 4 times a day.
10136-8{_}24456{_}When clear, it should be bottled and closely corked for a year; it will then be ready for use, but will keep any length of time.
10136-8{_}24457{_}This is a most excellent stomachic when taken pure in small quantities; or, as the strength of the brandy is very little deteriorated by the other ingredients, it may be diluted with water.
10136-8{_}24458{_}_Time_.--To be stirred every day for 3 days.
10136-8{_}24459{_}_Average cost_, 7s.
10136-8{_}24460{_}_Sufficient_ to make 2 quarts.
10136-8{_}24461{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in March.
10136-8{_}24462{_}A VERY SIMPLE AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING A VERY SUPERIOR ORANGE WINE.
10136-8{_}24463{_}1827.
10136-8{_}24464{_}INGREDIENTS.--90 Seville oranges, 32 lbs.
10136-8{_}24465{_}of lump sugar, water.
10136-8{_}24466{_}_Mode_.--Break up the sugar into small pieces, and put it into a dry, sweet 9-gallon cask, placed in a cellar or other storehouse, where it is intended to be kept.
10136-8{_}24467{_}Have ready close to the cask two large pans or wooden keelers, into one of which put the peel of the oranges pared quite thin, and into the other the pulp after the juice has been squeezed from it.
10136-8{_}24468{_}Strain the juice through a piece of double muslin, and put it into the cask with the sugar.
10136-8{_}24469{_}Then pour about 1-1/2 gallon of cold spring water on both the peels and pulp; let it stand for 24 hours, and then strain it into the cask; add more water to the peels and pulp when this is done, and repeat the same process every day for a week: it should take about a week to fill up the cask.
10136-8{_}24470{_}Be careful to apportion the quantity as nearly as possible to the seven days, and to stir the contents of the cask each day.
10136-8{_}24471{_}On the ''third' day after the cask is full,--that is, the 'tenth' day after the commencement of making,--the cask may be securely bunged down.
10136-8{_}24472{_}This is a very simple and easy method, and the wine made according to it will be pronounced to be most excellent.
10136-8{_}24473{_}There is no troublesome boiling, and all fermentation takes place in the cask.
10136-8{_}24474{_}When the above directions are attended to, the wine cannot fail to be good.
10136-8{_}24475{_}It should be bottled in 8 or 9 months, and will be fit for use in a twelve month after the time of making.
10136-8{_}24476{_}Ginger wine may be made in precisely the same manner, only, with the 9-gallon cask for ginger wine, 2 lbs.
10136-8{_}24477{_}of the best whole ginger, 'bruised', must be put with the sugar.
10136-8{_}24478{_}It will be found convenient to tie the ginger loosely in a muslin bag.
10136-8{_}24479{_}_Time_.--Altogether, 10 days to make it.
10136-8{_}24480{_}_Average cost_, 2s.
10136-8{_}24481{_}6d.
10136-8{_}24482{_}per gallon.
10136-8{_}24483{_}_Sufficient_ for 9 gallons.
10136-8{_}24484{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in March, and bottle it the following January.
10136-8{_}24485{_}RASPBERRY VINEGAR.
10136-8{_}24486{_}1828.
10136-8{_}24487{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 3 pints of the best vinegar allow 4-1/2 pints of freshly-gathered raspberries; to each pint of liquor allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24488{_}of pounded loaf sugar, 1 wineglassful of brandy.
10136-8{_}24489{_}_Mode_.--Let the raspberries be freshly gathered; pick them from the stalks, and put 1-1/2 pint of them into a stone jar; pour 3 pints of the best vinegar over them, and let them remain for 24 hours; then strain the liquor over another 1-1/2 pint of fresh raspberries.
10136-8{_}24490{_}Let them remain another 24 hours, and the following day repeat the process for the third time; then drain off the liquor without pressing, and pass it through a jelly-bag (previously wetted with plain vinegar), into a stone jar.
10136-8{_}24491{_}Add to every pint of the liquor 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24492{_}of pounded loaf sugar; stir them together, and, when the sugar is dissolved, cover the jar; set it upon the fire in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil for an hour, removing the scum as fast as it rises; add to each pint a glass of brandy, bottle it, and seal the corks.
10136-8{_}24493{_}This is an excellent drink in cases of fevers and colds: it should be diluted with cold water, according to the taste or requirement of the patient.
10136-8{_}24494{_}_Time_.--To be boiled 1 hour.

10136-8{_}24504{_}of isinglass, the rind of 1 lemon.
10136-8{_}24505{_}_Mode_.--Gather the rhubarb about the middle of May; wipe it with a wet cloth, and, with a mallet, bruise it in a large wooden tub or other convenient means.
10136-8{_}24506{_}When reduced to a pulp, weigh it, and to every 5 lbs.
10136-8{_}24507{_}add 1 gallon of cold spring water; let these remain for 3 days, stirring 3 or 4 times a day; and, on the fourth day, press the pulp through a hair sieve; put the liquor into a tub, and to every gallon put 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}24508{_}of loaf sugar; stir in the sugar until it is quite dissolved, and add the lemon-rind; let the liquor remain, and, in 4, 5, or 6 days, the fermentation will begin to subside, and a crust or head will be formed, which should be skimmed off, or the liquor drawn from it, when the crust begins to crack or separate.
10136-8{_}24509{_}Put the wine into a cask, and if, after that, it ferments, rack it off into another cask, and in a fortnight stop it down.
10136-8{_}24510{_}If the wine should have lost any of its original sweetness, add a little more loaf sugar, taking care that the cask is full.
10136-8{_}24511{_}Bottle it off in February or March, and in the summer it should be fit to drink.
10136-8{_}24512{_}It will improve greatly by keeping; and, should a very brilliant colour be desired, add a little currant-juice.

10136-8{_}24525{_}CLARET-CUP.
10136-8{_}24526{_}[Illustration: CLARET CUP.]
10136-8{_}24527{_}1831.
10136-8{_}24528{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 bottle of claret, 1 bottle of soda-water, about 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}24529{_}of pounded ice, 4 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 liqueur-glass of Maraschino, a sprig of green borage.
10136-8{_}24530{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a silver cup, regulating the proportion of ice by the state of the weather: if very warm, a larger quantity would be necessary.
10136-8{_}24531{_}Hand the cup round with a clean napkin passed through one of the handles, that the edge of the cup may be wiped after each guest has partaken of the contents thereof.
10136-8{_}24532{_}_Seasonable_ in summer.
10136-8{_}24533{_}CLARETS.--All those wines called in England clarets are the     produce of the country round Bordeaux, or the Bordelais; but it     is remarkable that there is no pure wine in France known by the     name of claret, which is a corruption of _clairet_, a term that     is applied there to any red or rose-coloured wine.
10136-8{_}24534{_}Round     Bordeaux are produced a number of wines of the first quality,     which pass under the name simply of _vins de Bordeaux_, or have     the designation of the particular district where they are made;     as Lafitte, Latour, &c. The clarets brought to the English     market are frequently prepared for it by the wine-growers by     mixing together several Bordeaux wines, or by adding to them a     portion of some other wines; but in France the pure wines are     carefully preserved distinct.
10136-8{_}24535{_}The genuine wines of Bordeaux are     of great variety, that part being one of the most distinguished     in France; and the principal vineyards are those of Medoc,     Palus, Graves, and Blanche, the product of each having     characters considerably different.

10136-8{_}24539{_}of pounded ice, a sprig of green borage.
10136-8{_}24540{_}_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a silver cup; stir them together, and serve the same as claret-cup No.
10136-8{_}24541{_}1831.
10136-8{_}24542{_}Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient to suit some tastes, increase the quantity.
10136-8{_}24543{_}When borage is not easily obtainable, substitute for it a few slices of cucumber-rind.
10136-8{_}24544{_}_Seasonable_.--Suitable for pic-nics, balls, weddings, and other festive occasions.
10136-8{_}24545{_}CHAMPAGNE.--This, the most celebrated of French wines, is the     produce chiefly of the province of that name, and is generally     understood in England to be a brisk, effervescing, or sparkling     white wine, of a very fine flavour; but this is only one of the     varieties of this class.
10136-8{_}24546{_}There is both red and white champagne,     and each of these may be either still or brisk.
10136-8{_}24547{_}There are the     sparkling wines (mousseux), and the still wines (non-mousseux).
10136-8{_}24548{_}The brisk are in general the most highly esteemed, or, at least,     are the most popular in this country, on account of their     delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive     from the carbonic acid they contain, and to which they owe their     briskness.
10136-8{_}24549{_}GINGER BEER.
10136-8{_}24550{_}1833.
10136-8{_}24551{_}INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 lbs.
10136-8{_}24552{_}of loaf sugar, 1-1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}24553{_}of bruised ginger, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}24554{_}of cream of tartar, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 3 gallons of boiling water, 2 large tablespoonfuls of thick and fresh brewer's yeast.
10136-8{_}24555{_}_Mode_.--Peel the lemons, squeeze the juice, strain it, and put the peel and juice into a large earthen pan, with the bruised ginger, cream of tartar, and loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}24556{_}Pour over these ingredients 3 gallons of boiling water; let it stand until just warm, when add the yeast, which should be thick and perfectly fresh.
10136-8{_}24557{_}Stir the contents of the pan well, and let them remain near the fire all night, covering the pan over with a cloth.
10136-8{_}24558{_}The next day skim off the yeast, and pour the liquor carefully into another vessel, leaving the sediment; then bottle immediately, and tie the corks down, and in 3 days the ginger beer will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}24559{_}For some tastes, the above proportion of sugar may be found rather too large, when it may be diminished; but the beer will not keep so long good.
10136-8{_}24560{_}_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.
10136-8{_}24561{_}; or 1/2d.
10136-8{_}24562{_}per bottle.
10136-8{_}24563{_}_Sufficient_ to fill 4 dozen ginger-beer bottles.
10136-8{_}24564{_}_Seasonable_.--This should be made during the summer months.
10136-8{_}24565{_}LEMONADE.
10136-8{_}24566{_}1834.
10136-8{_}24567{_}INGREDIENTS--The rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 3 large or 4 small ones, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24568{_}of loaf sugar, 1 quart of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24569{_}_Mode_.--Rub some of the sugar, in lumps, on 2 of the lemons until they have imbibed all the oil from them, and put it with the remainder of the sugar into a jug; add the lemon-juice (but no pips), and pour over the whole a quart of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24570{_}When the sugar is dissolved, strain the lemonade through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, and, when cool, it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}24571{_}The lemonade will be much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up in it; a little sherry mixed with it, also, makes this beverage much nicer.
10136-8{_}24572{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}24573{_}per quart.
10136-8{_}24574{_}LEMONADE--"There is a current opinion among women" says Brillat     Savarin "which every year causes the death of many young     women,--that acids, especially vinegar, are preventives of     obesity.
10136-8{_}24575{_}Beyond all doubt, acids have the effect of destroying     obesity; but they also destroy health and freshness.
10136-8{_}24576{_}Lemonade     is, of all acids, the most harmless; but few stomachs can resist     it long.
10136-8{_}24577{_}I knew, in 1776, at Dijon, a young lady of great     beauty, to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship, great,     almost as those of love.
10136-8{_}24578{_}One day, when she had for some time     gradually grown pale and thin (previously she had a slight     embonpoint), she told me in confidence, that as her young     friends had ridiculed her for being fat, she had, to counteract     the tendency, been in the habit every day of drinking a large     glass of vinaigre.
10136-8{_}24579{_}She died at eighteen years of age, from the     effects of these potions."
10136-8{_}24580{_}TO MAKE NEGUS.
10136-8{_}24581{_}1835.
10136-8{_}24582{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of port wine allow 1 quart of boiling water, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}24583{_}of sugar, 1 lemon, grated nutmeg to taste.
10136-8{_}24584{_}_Mode_.--As this beverage is more usually drunk at children's parties than at any other, the wine need not be very old or expensive for the purpose, a new fruity wine answering very well for it.
10136-8{_}24585{_}Put the wine into a jug, rub some lumps of sugar (equal to 1/4 lb.)
10136-8{_}24586{_}on the lemon-rind until all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed, then squeeze the juice, and strain it.
10136-8{_}24587{_}Add the sugar and lemon-juice to the port wine, with the grated nutmeg; pour over it the boiling water, cover the jug, and, when the beverage has cooled a little, it will be fit for use.
10136-8{_}24588{_}Negus may also be made of sherry, or any other sweet white wine, but is more usually made of port than of any other beverage.
10136-8{_}24589{_}_Sufficient_--Allow 1 pint of wine, with the other ingredients in proportion, for a party of 9 or 10 children.
10136-8{_}24590{_}A PLEASANT DRINK FOR WARM WEATHER.
10136-8{_}24591{_}1836.
10136-8{_}24592{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every 1-1/2 pint of good ale allow 1 bottle of ginger beer.
10136-8{_}24593{_}_Mode_.--For this beverage the ginger beer must be in an effervescing state, and the beer not in the least turned or sour.
10136-8{_}24594{_}Mix them together, and drink immediately.
10136-8{_}24595{_}The draught is refreshing and wholesome, as the ginger corrects the action of the beer.
10136-8{_}24596{_}It does not deteriorate by standing a little, but, of course, is better when taken fresh.
10136-8{_}24597{_}FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT.
10136-8{_}24598{_}1837.
10136-8{_}24599{_}INGREDIENTS.--The juice of 1 lemon, a tumbler-ful of cold water, pounded sugar to taste, 4 small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.
10136-8{_}24600{_}_Mode_.--Squeeze the juice from the lemon; strain, and add it to the water, with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely.
10136-8{_}24601{_}When well mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and drink while the mixture is in an effervescing state.
10136-8{_}24602{_}TO MULL WINE.
10136-8{_}24603{_}1838.
10136-8{_}24604{_}INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of wine allow 1 large cupful of water, sugar and spice to taste.
10136-8{_}24605{_}_Mode_.--In making preparations like the above, it is very difficult to give the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice, as what quantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful.
10136-8{_}24606{_}Boil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted, then add the wine and sugar, and bring the whole to the boiling-point, when serve with strips of crisp dry toast, or with biscuits.
10136-8{_}24607{_}The spices usually used for mulled wine are cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon or mace.
10136-8{_}24608{_}Any kind of wine may be mulled, but port and claret are those usually selected for the purpose; and the latter requires a very large proportion of sugar.
10136-8{_}24609{_}The vessel that the wine is boiled in must be delicately clean, and should be kept exclusively for the purpose.
10136-8{_}24610{_}Small tin warmers may be purchased for a trifle, which are more suitable than saucepans, as, if the latter are not scrupulously clean, they will spoil the wine, by imparting to it a very disagreeable flavour.
10136-8{_}24611{_}These warmers should be used for no other purposes.
10136-8{_}24612{_}TO MAKE HOT PUNCH.
10136-8{_}24613{_}1839.
10136-8{_}24614{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of rum, 1/2 pint of brandy, 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}24615{_}of sugar, 1 large lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 pint of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24616{_}[Illustration: PUNCH-BOWL AND LADLE.]
10136-8{_}24617{_}_Mode_.--Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skin, then put the sugar into a punchbowl; add the lemon-juice (free from pips), and mix these two ingredients well together.
10136-8{_}24618{_}Pour over them the boiling water, stir well together, add the rum, brandy, and nutmeg; mix thoroughly, and the punch will be ready to serve.
10136-8{_}24619{_}It is very important in making good punch that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated; and, to insure success, the processes of mixing must be diligently attended to.
10136-8{_}24620{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow a quart for 4 persons; but this information must be taken _cum grano salis_; for the capacities of persons for this kind of beverage are generally supposed to vary considerably.
10136-8{_}24621{_}PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine,     hot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar.
10136-8{_}24622{_}It is considered     to be very intoxicating; but this is probably because the     spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the     sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it     really is.
10136-8{_}24623{_}Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the     middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago, has almost     disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine.
10136-8{_}24624{_}There are many different varieties of punch.
10136-8{_}24625{_}It is sometimes     kept cold in bottles, and makes a most agreeable summer drink.
10136-8{_}24626{_}In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in     its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious     properties are more than usually felt.
10136-8{_}24627{_}Where fresh lemons cannot     be had for punch or similar beverages, crystallized citric acid     and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the     same thing.
10136-8{_}24628{_}In the composition of "Regent's punch," champagne,     brandy, and _veritable Martinique_ are required; "Norfolk punch"     requires Seville oranges; "Milk punch" may be extemporized by     adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it     through a jelly-bag.
10136-8{_}24629{_}Then there are "Wine punch," "Tea punch,"     and "French punch," made with lemons, spirits, and wine, in     fantastic proportions.
10136-8{_}24630{_}But of all the compounds of these     materials, perhaps, for a _summer_ drink, the North-American     "mint julep" is the most inviting.
10136-8{_}24631{_}Captain Marryat gives the     following recipe for its preparation:--"Put into a tumbler about     a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint; upon them put a     spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of peach and     common brandy, so as to fill up one third, or, perhaps, a little     less; then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler.
10136-8{_}24632{_}Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh     pineapple; and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted     outside with stalactites of ice.
10136-8{_}24633{_}As the ice melts, you drink."
10136-8{_}24634{_}The Virginians, say Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having     invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the     "Comus" of Milton, he claims it for his own country.
10136-8{_}24635{_}WHISKEY CORDIAL.
10136-8{_}24636{_}1840.
10136-8{_}24637{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}24638{_}of ripe white currants, the rind of 2 lemons, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}24639{_}of grated ginger, 1 quart of whiskey, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24640{_}of lump sugar.
10136-8{_}24641{_}_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks; put them into a large jug; add the lemon-rind, ginger, and whiskey; cover the jug closely, and let it remain covered for 24 hours.
10136-8{_}24642{_}Strain through a hair sieve, add the lump sugar, and let it stand 12 hours longer; then bottle, and cork well.
10136-8{_}24643{_}_Time_.--To stand 24 hours before being strained; 12 hours after the sugar is added.
10136-8{_}24644{_}_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.
10136-8{_}24645{_}[Illustration]     INVALID COOKERY.
10136-8{_}24646{_}CHAPTER XXXVIII.
10136-8{_}24647{_}A FEW RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING FOR INVALIDS.
10136-8{_}24648{_}1841.
10136-8{_}24649{_}LET all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalids' cookery be delicately and 'scrupulously clean;' if this is not the case, a disagreeable flavour may be imparted to the preparation, which flavour may disgust, and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment when brought to him or her.
10136-8{_}24650{_}1842.
10136-8{_}24651{_}For invalids, never make a large quantity of one thing, as they seldom require much at a time; and it is desirable that variety be provided for them.
10136-8{_}24652{_}1843.
10136-8{_}24653{_}Always have something in readiness; a little beef tea, nicely made and nicely skimmed, a few spoonfuls of jelly, &c. &c., that it may be administered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it.
10136-8{_}24654{_}If obliged to wait a long time, the patient loses the desire to eat, and often turns against the food when brought to him or her.
10136-8{_}24655{_}1844.
10136-8{_}24656{_}In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids, let everything look as tempting as possible.
10136-8{_}24657{_}Have a clean tray-cloth laid smoothly over the tray; let the spoons, tumblers, cups and saucers, &c., be very clean and bright.
10136-8{_}24658{_}Gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when served in a basin or cup and saucer.
10136-8{_}24659{_}1845.
10136-8{_}24660{_}As milk is an important article of food for the sick, in warm weather let it be kept on ice, to prevent its turning sour.
10136-8{_}24661{_}Many other delicacies may also be preserved good in the same manner for some little time.
10136-8{_}24662{_}1846.
10136-8{_}24663{_}If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables, never send them up undercooked, or half raw; and let a small quantity only be temptingly arranged on a dish.
10136-8{_}24664{_}This rule will apply to every preparation, as an invalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces are served to him.
10136-8{_}24665{_}1847.
10136-8{_}24666{_}Never leave food about a sick room; if the patient cannot eat it when brought to him, take it away, and bring it to him in an hour or two's time.
10136-8{_}24667{_}Miss Nightingale says, "To leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from meal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the interval, is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all."
10136-8{_}24668{_}She says, "I have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece of ignorance.
10136-8{_}24669{_}Let the food come at the right time, and be taken away, eaten or uneaten, at the right time, but never let a patient have 'something always standing' by him, if you don't wish to disgust him of everything."
10136-8{_}24670{_}1848.
10136-8{_}24671{_}Never serve beef tea or broth with the _smallest particle_ of fat or grease on the surface.
10136-8{_}24672{_}It is better, after making either of these, to allow them to get perfectly cold, when _all the fat_ may be easily removed; then warm up as much as may be required.
10136-8{_}24673{_}Two or three pieces of clean whity-brown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy particles that may be floating at the top, as the grease will cling to the paper.
10136-8{_}24674{_}1849.
10136-8{_}24675{_}Roast mutton, chickens, rabbits, calves' feet or head, game, fish (simply dressed), and simple puddings, are all light food, and easily digested.
10136-8{_}24676{_}Of course, these things are only partaken of, supposing the patient is recovering.
10136-8{_}24677{_}1850.
10136-8{_}24678{_}A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed, and broiled to a turn, is a dish to be recommended for invalids; but it must not be served _with all the fat_ at the end, nor must it be too thickly cut.
10136-8{_}24679{_}Let it be cooked over a fire free from smoke, and sent up with the gravy in it, between two very hot plates.
10136-8{_}24680{_}Nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than _smoked_ food.
10136-8{_}24681{_}1851.
10136-8{_}24682{_}In making toast-and-water, never blacken the bread, but toast it only a nice brown.
10136-8{_}24683{_}Never leave toast-and-water to make until the moment it is required, as it cannot then be properly prepared,--at least, the patient will be obliged to drink it warm, which is anything but agreeable.
10136-8{_}24684{_}1852.
10136-8{_}24685{_}In boiling eggs for invalids, let the white be just set; if boiled hard, they will be likely to disagree with the patient.
10136-8{_}24686{_}1853.
10136-8{_}24687{_}In Miss Nightingale's admirable "Notes on Nursing," a book that no mother or nurse should be without, she says,--"You cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet.
10136-8{_}24688{_}A nurse should never put before a patient milk that is sour, meat or soup that is turned, an egg that is bad, or vegetables underdone."
10136-8{_}24689{_}Yet often, she says, she has seen these things brought in to the sick, in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurse's.
10136-8{_}24690{_}It is here that the clever nurse appears,--she will not bring in the peccant article; but, not to disappoint the patient, she will whip up something else in a few minutes.
10136-8{_}24691{_}Remember, that sick cookery should half do the work of your poor patient's weak digestion.
10136-8{_}24692{_}1854.
10136-8{_}24693{_}She goes on to caution nurses, by saying,--"Take care not to spill into your patient's saucer; in other words, take care that the outside bottom rim of his cup shall be quite dry and clean.
10136-8{_}24694{_}If, every time he lifts his cup to his lips, he has to carry the saucer with it, or else to drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet, or bedgown, or pillow, or, if he is sitting up, his dress, you have no idea what a difference this minute want of care on your part makes to his comfort, and even to his willingness for food."
10136-8{_}24695{_}RECIPES.
10136-8{_}24696{_}CHAPTER XXXIX.
10136-8{_}24697{_}TO MAKE ARROWROOT.
10136-8{_}24698{_}1855.
10136-8{_}24699{_}INGREDIENTS.--Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water, 1/2 pint of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24700{_}_Mode_.--Mix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water, then pour on it the _boiling_ water, _stirring_ all the time.
10136-8{_}24701{_}The water must be _boiling_ at the time it is poured on the mixture, or it will not thicken; if mixed with hot water only, it must be put into a clean saucepan, and boiled until it thickens; but this is more trouble, and quite unnecessary if the water is boiling at first.
10136-8{_}24702{_}Put the arrowroot into a tumbler, sweeten it with lump sugar, and flavour it with grated nutmeg or cinnamon, or a piece of lemon-peel, or, when allowed, 3 tablespoonfuls of port or sherry.
10136-8{_}24703{_}As arrowroot is in itself flavourless and insipid, it is almost necessary to add the wine to make it palatable.
10136-8{_}24704{_}Arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer, but is not so easily digested.
10136-8{_}24705{_}It should be mixed in the same manner, with 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water, the boiling milk then poured on it, and well stirred.
10136-8{_}24706{_}When made in this manner, no wine should be added, but merely sugar, and a little grated nutmeg or lemon-peel.
10136-8{_}24707{_}_Time_.--If obliged to be boiled, 2 minutes.
10136-8{_}24708{_}_Average cost_, 2d.
10136-8{_}24709{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}24710{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1/2 pint of arrowroot.
10136-8{_}24711{_}MISS NIGHTINGALE says, in her "Notes on Nursing," that arrowroot     is a grand dependence of the nurse.
10136-8{_}24712{_}As a vehicle for wine, and     as a restorative quickly prepared, it is all very well, but it     is nothing but starch and water; flour is both more nutritive     and less liable to ferment, and is preferable wherever it can be     used.
10136-8{_}24713{_}BARLEY GRUEL.
10136-8{_}24714{_}1856.
10136-8{_}24715{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 oz.
10136-8{_}24716{_}of Scotch or pearl barley, 1/2 pint of port wine, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 quart and 1/2 pint of water, sugar to taste.
10136-8{_}24717{_}_Mode_.--After well washing the barley, boil it in 1/2 pint of water for 1/4 hour; then pour this water away; put to the barley the quart of fresh boiling water, and let it boil until the liquid is reduced to half; then strain it off.
10136-8{_}24718{_}Add the wine, sugar, and lemon-peel; simmer for 5 minutes, and put it away in a clean jug.
10136-8{_}24719{_}It can be warmed from time to time, as required.
10136-8{_}24720{_}_Time_.--To be boiled until reduced to half.
10136-8{_}24721{_}_Average cost_, 1s.
10136-8{_}24722{_}6d.
10136-8{_}24723{_}_Sufficient_ with the wine to make 1-1/2 pint of gruel.
10136-8{_}24724{_}TO MAKE BARLEY-WATER.
10136-8{_}24725{_}1857.
10136-8{_}24726{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 oz.
10136-8{_}24727{_}of pearl barley, 2 quarts of boiling water, 1 pint of cold water.
10136-8{_}24728{_}_Mode_.--Wash the barley in cold water; put it into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water, and when it has boiled for about 1/4 hour, strain off the water, and add the 2 quarts of fresh boiling water.
10136-8{_}24729{_}Boil it until the liquid is reduced one half; strain it, and it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}24730{_}It may be flavoured with lemon-peel, after being sweetened, or a small piece may be simmered with the barley.
10136-8{_}24731{_}When the invalid may take it, a little lemon-juice gives this pleasant drink in illness a very nice flavour.
10136-8{_}24732{_}_Time_.--To boil until the liquid is reduced one half.
10136-8{_}24733{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1 quart of barley-water.
10136-8{_}24734{_}TO MAKE BEEF TEA.
10136-8{_}24735{_}1858.
10136-8{_}24736{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}24737{_}of lean gravy-beef, 1 quart of water, 1 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}24738{_}_Mode_.--Have the meat cut without fat and bone, and choose a nice fleshy piece.
10136-8{_}24739{_}Cut it into small pieces about the size of dice, and put it into a clean saucepan.
10136-8{_}24740{_}Add the water _cold_ to it; put it on the fire, and bring it to the boiling-point; then skim well.
10136-8{_}24741{_}Put in the salt when the water boils, and _simmer_ the beef tea _gently_ from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, removing any more scum should it appear on the surface.
10136-8{_}24742{_}Strain the tea through a hair sieve, and set it by in a cool place.
10136-8{_}24743{_}When wanted for use, remove every particle of fat from the top; warm up as much as may be required, adding, if necessary, a little more salt.
10136-8{_}24744{_}This preparation is simple beef tea, and is to be administered to those invalids to whom flavourings and seasonings are not allowed.
10136-8{_}24745{_}When the patient is very low, use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion of water.
10136-8{_}24746{_}Should the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable manner, it is easy to make it so by following the directions in the next recipe, which is an admirable one for making savoury beef tea.
10136-8{_}24747{_}Beef tea is always better when made the day before it is wanted, and then warmed up.
10136-8{_}24748{_}It is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin, and to place this basin in a saucepan of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24749{_}When the tea is warm, it is ready to serve.
10136-8{_}24750{_}_Time_.--1/4 to 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}24751{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}24752{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}24753{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24754{_}of meat for a pint of good beef tea.
10136-8{_}24755{_}MISS NIGHTINGALE says, one of the most common errors among     nurses, with respect to sick diet, is the belief that beef tea     is the most nutritive of all article.
10136-8{_}24756{_}She says, "Just try and     boil down a lb.
10136-8{_}24757{_}of beef into beef tea; evaporate your beef tea,     and see what is left of your beef: you will find that there is     barely a teaspoonful of solid nourishment to 1/4 pint of water     in beef tea.
10136-8{_}24758{_}Nevertheless, there is a certain reparative quality     in it,--we do not know what,--as there is in tea; but it maybe     safely given in almost any inflammatory disease, and is as     little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent,     where much nourishment is required."

10136-8{_}24760{_}(_Soyer's Recipe_.)
10136-8{_}24761{_}1859.
10136-8{_}24762{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}24763{_}of solid beef, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}24764{_}of butter, 1 clove, 2 button onions or 1/2 a large one, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1 quart of water.
10136-8{_}24765{_}_Mode_.--Cut the beef into very small dice; put it into a stewpan with the butter, clove, onion, and salt; stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes, until it produces a thin gravy; then add the water, and let it simmer gently from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, skimming off every particle of fat.
10136-8{_}24766{_}When done, strain it through a sieve, and put it by in a cool place until required.
10136-8{_}24767{_}The same, if wanted quite plain, is done by merely omitting the vegetables, salt, and clove; the butter cannot be objectionable, as it is taken out in skimming.
10136-8{_}24768{_}_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.
10136-8{_}24769{_}_Average cost_, 8d.
10136-8{_}24770{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}24771{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24772{_}of beef to make 1 pint of good beef tea.
10136-8{_}24773{_}_Note_.--The meat loft from beef tea may be boiled a little longer, and pounded, with spices, &c., for potting.
10136-8{_}24774{_}It makes a very nice breakfast dish.
10136-8{_}24775{_}DR. CHRISTISON says that "every one will be struck with the     readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take     diluted meat juice, or beef tea repeatedly, when they refuse all     other kinds of food."
10136-8{_}24776{_}This is particularly remarkable in case of     gastric fever, in which, he says, little or nothing else besides     beef tea, or diluted meat juice, has been taken for weeks, or     even months; and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely 1/4     oz.
10136-8{_}24777{_}of anything but water.
10136-8{_}24778{_}The result is so striking, that he     asks, "What is its mode of action?
10136-8{_}24779{_}Not simple nutriment; 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}24780{_}of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily     wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances."
10136-8{_}24781{_}Possibly, he     says, it belongs to a new denomination of remedies.
10136-8{_}24782{_}BAKED BEEF TEA.
10136-8{_}24783{_}1860.
10136-8{_}24784{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}24785{_}of fleshy beef, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt.
10136-8{_}24786{_}_Mode_.--Cut the beef into small square pieces, after trimming off all the fat, and put it into a baking-jar, with the above proportion of water and salt; cover the jar well, place it in a warm, but not hot oven, and bake for 3 or 4 hours.
10136-8{_}24787{_}When the oven is very fierce in the daytime, it is a good plan to put the jar in at night, and let it remain till the next morning, when the tea will be done.
10136-8{_}24788{_}It should be strained, and put by in a cool place until wanted.
10136-8{_}24789{_}It may also be flavoured with an onion, a clove, and a few sweet herbs, &c., when the stomach is sufficiently strong to take those.
10136-8{_}24790{_}_Time_.--3 or 4 hours, or to be left in the oven all night.
10136-8{_}24791{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}24792{_}per pint.
10136-8{_}24793{_}_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24794{_}of meat for 1 pint of good beef tea.
10136-8{_}24795{_}BAKED OR STEWED CALF'S FOOT.
10136-8{_}24796{_}1861.
10136-8{_}24797{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 blade of mace, the rind of 1/4 lemon, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}24798{_}_Mode_.--Well clean the foot, and either stew or bake it in the milk-and-water with the other ingredients from 3 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}24799{_}To enhance the flavour, an onion and a small quantity of celery may be added, if approved; 1/2 a teacupful of cream, stirred in just before serving, is also a great improvement to this dish.
10136-8{_}24800{_}_Time_.--3 to 4 hours.
10136-8{_}24801{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 9d.
10136-8{_}24802{_}each.
10136-8{_}24803{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 person.
10136-8{_}24804{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}24805{_}CALF'S-FOOT BROTH.
10136-8{_}24806{_}1862.
10136-8{_}24807{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 3 pints of water, 1 small lump of sugar, nutmeg to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, a piece of butter the size of a nut.
10136-8{_}24808{_}_Mode_.--Stew the foot in the water, with the lemon-peel, very gently, until the liquid is half wasted, removing any scum, should it rise to the surface.
10136-8{_}24809{_}Set it by in a basin until quite cold, then take off every particle of fat.
10136-8{_}24810{_}Warm up about 1/2 pint of the broth, adding the butter, sugar, and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg; take it off the fire for a minute or two, then add the beaten yolk of the egg; keep stirring over the fire until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to boil again after the egg is added, or it will curdle, and the broth will be spoiled.
10136-8{_}24811{_}_Time_.--To be boiled until the liquid is reduced one half.
10136-8{_}24812{_}_Average cost_, in full season, 9d.
10136-8{_}24813{_}each.
10136-8{_}24814{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1-1/4 pint of broth.
10136-8{_}24815{_}_Seasonable_ from March to October.
10136-8{_}24816{_}CHICKEN BROTH.
10136-8{_}24817{_}1863.
10136-8{_}24818{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole one; 1 quart of water, 1 blade of mace, 1/2 onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, 10 peppercorns.
10136-8{_}24819{_}_Mode_.--An old fowl not suitable for eating may be converted into very good broth, or, if a young one be used, the inferior joints may be put in the broth, and the best pieces reserved for dressing in some other manner.
10136-8{_}24820{_}Put the fowl into a saucepan, with all the ingredients, and simmer gently for 1-1/2 hour, carefully skimming the broth well.
10136-8{_}24821{_}When done, strain, and put by in a cool place until wanted; then take all the fat off the top, warm up as much as may be required, and serve.
10136-8{_}24822{_}This broth is, of course, only for those invalids whose stomachs are strong enough to digest it, with a flavouring of herbs, &c. It may be made in the same manner as beef tea, with water and salt only; but the preparation will be but tasteless and insipid.
10136-8{_}24823{_}When the invalid cannot digest this chicken broth with the flavouring, we would recommend plain beef tea in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be without the addition of herbs, onions, &c.
10136-8{_}24824{_}_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}24825{_}_Sufficient_ to make rather more than 1 pint of broth.
10136-8{_}24826{_}NUTRITIOUS COFFEE.
10136-8{_}24827{_}1864.
10136-8{_}24828{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}24829{_}of ground coffee, 1 pint of milk.
10136-8{_}24830{_}_Mode_.--Let the coffee be freshly ground; put it into a saucepan, with the milk, which should be made nearly boiling before the coffee is put in, and boil both together for 3 minutes; clear it by pouring some of it into a cup, and then back again, and leave it on the hob for a few minutes to settle thoroughly.
10136-8{_}24831{_}This coffee may be made still more nutritious by the addition of an egg well beaten, and put into the coffee-cup.
10136-8{_}24832{_}_Time_.--5 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to settle.
10136-8{_}24833{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1 large breakfast-cupful of coffee.
10136-8{_}24834{_}Our great nurse Miss Nightingale remarks, that "a great deal too     much against tea is said by wise people, and a great deal too     much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people.
10136-8{_}24835{_}When you see     the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for     their 'tea,' you cannot but feel that Nature knows what she is     about.
10136-8{_}24836{_}But a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as     a great deal; and a great deal of tea, and especially of coffee,     impairs the little power of digestion they have.
10136-8{_}24837{_}Yet a nurse,     because she sees how one or two cups of tea or coffee restore     her patient, thinks that three or four cups will do twice as     much.
10136-8{_}24838{_}This is not the case at all; it is, however, certain that     there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the     English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it when he can     take nothing else, and he often can't take anything else, if he     has it not.
10136-8{_}24839{_}Coffee is a better restorative than tea, but a     greater impairer of the digestion.
10136-8{_}24840{_}In making coffee, it is     absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry, and grind it at     home; otherwise, you may reckon upon its containing a certain     amount of chicory, at least.
10136-8{_}24841{_}This is not a question of the     taste, or of the wholesomeness of chicory; it is, that chicory     has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee,     and, therefore, you may as well not give it."
10136-8{_}24842{_}THE INVALID'S CUTLET.
10136-8{_}24843{_}1865.
10136-8{_}24844{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 nice cutlet from a loin or neck of mutton, 2 teacupfuls of water, 1 very small stick of celery, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}24845{_}_Mode_.--Have the cutlet cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton; take off all the fat; put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; stew _very gently_ indeed for nearly 2 hours, and skim off every particle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to time.
10136-8{_}24846{_}The celery should be cut into thin slices before it is added to the meat, and care must be taken not to put in too much of this ingredient, or the dish will not be good.
10136-8{_}24847{_}If the water is allowed to boil fast, the cutlet will be hard.
10136-8{_}24848{_}_Time_.--2 hours' very gentle stewing.
10136-8{_}24849{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}24850{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 person.
10136-8{_}24851{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.

10136-8{_}24853{_}1866.
10136-8{_}24854{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}24855{_}of eels, a small bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley; 1/2 onion, 10 peppercorns, 3 pints of water, 2 cloves, salt and pepper to taste.
10136-8{_}24856{_}_Mode_.--After having cleaned and skinned the eel, cut it into small pieces, and put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; simmer gently until the liquid is reduced nearly half, carefully removing the scum as it rises.
10136-8{_}24857{_}Strain it through a hair sieve; put it by in a cool place, and, when wanted, take off all the fat from the top, warm up as much as is required, and serve with sippets of toasted bread.
10136-8{_}24858{_}This is a very nutritious broth, and easy of digestion.
10136-8{_}24859{_}_Time_.--To be simmered until the liquor is reduced to half.
10136-8{_}24860{_}_Average cost_, 6d.
10136-8{_}24861{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1-1/2 pint of broth.
10136-8{_}24862{_}_Seasonable_ from June to March.
10136-8{_}24863{_}EGG WINE.
10136-8{_}24864{_}1867.
10136-8{_}24865{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 tablespoonful and 1/2 glass of cold water, 1 glass of sherry, sugar and grated nutmeg to taste.
10136-8{_}24866{_}_Mode_.--Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold water; make the wine-and-water hot, but not boiling; pour it on the egg, stirring all the time.
10136-8{_}24867{_}Add sufficient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture, and a little grated nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set it on a gentle fire, and stir the contents one way until they thicken, but _do not allow them to boil_.
10136-8{_}24868{_}Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted bread or plain crisp biscuits.
10136-8{_}24869{_}When the egg is not warmed, the mixture will be found easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink.
10136-8{_}24870{_}_Sufficient_ for 1 person.
10136-8{_}24871{_}TO MAKE GRUEL.
10136-8{_}24872{_}1868.
10136-8{_}24873{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of Robinson's patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, 1 pint of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24874{_}_Mode_.--Mix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold water in a basin; pour over them the boiling water, stirring it all the time.
10136-8{_}24875{_}Put it into a very clean saucepan; boil the gruel for 10 minutes, keeping it well stirred; sweeten to taste, and serve.
10136-8{_}24876{_}It may be flavoured with a small piece of lemon-peel, by boiling it in the gruel, or a little grated nutmeg may be put in; but in these matters the taste of the patient should be consulted.
10136-8{_}24877{_}Pour the gruel in a tumbler and serve.
10136-8{_}24878{_}When wine is allowed to the invalid, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make this preparation very nice.
10136-8{_}24879{_}In cases of colds, the same quantity of spirits is sometimes added instead of wine.
10136-8{_}24880{_}_Time_.--10 minutes.
10136-8{_}24881{_}_Sufficient_ to make a pint of gruel.
10136-8{_}24882{_}INVALID'S JELLY.
10136-8{_}24883{_}1869.
10136-8{_}24884{_}INGREDIENTS.--12 shanks of mutton, 3 quarts of water, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 3 blades of mace, 1 onion, 1 lb.
10136-8{_}24885{_}of lean beef, a crust of bread toasted brown.
10136-8{_}24886{_}_Mode_.--Soak the shanks in plenty of water for some hours, and scrub them well; put them, with the beef and other ingredients, into a saucepan with the water, and let them simmer very gently for 5 hours.
10136-8{_}24887{_}Strain the broth, and, when cold, take off all the fat.
10136-8{_}24888{_}It may be eaten either warmed up or cold as a jelly.

10136-8{_}24896{_}_Mode_.--Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly; cut the lemon into 2 or 3 thick slices, and remove as much as possible of the white outside pith, and all the pips.
10136-8{_}24897{_}Put the slices of lemon, the peel, and lump sugar into a jug; pour over the boiling water; cover it closely, and in 2 hours it will be fit to drink.
10136-8{_}24898{_}It should either be strained or poured off from the sediment.

10136-8{_}24901{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1 pint of lemonade.

10136-8{_}24903{_}NOURISHING LEMONADE.
10136-8{_}24904{_}1871.

10136-8{_}24906{_}of loaf sugar.
10136-8{_}24907{_}_Mode_.--Pare off the lemon-rind thinly, put it into a jug with the sugar, and pour over the boiling water.
10136-8{_}24908{_}Let it cool, then strain it; add the wine, lemon-juice, and eggs, previously well beaten, and also strained, and the beverage will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}24909{_}If thought desirable, the quantity of sherry and water could be lessened, and milk substituted for them.
10136-8{_}24910{_}To obtain the flavour of the lemon-rind properly, a few lumps of the sugar should be rubbed over it, until some of the yellow is absorbed.
10136-8{_}24911{_}_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour to make it.
10136-8{_}24912{_}_Average cost_, 1s.

10136-8{_}24916{_}TO MAKE MUTTON BROTH.
10136-8{_}24917{_}1872.
10136-8{_}24918{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}24919{_}of the scrag end of the neck of mutton, 1 onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, 4 turnip, 1/2 pints of water, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}24920{_}_Mode_.--Put the mutton into a stewpan; pour over the water cold and add the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}24921{_}When it boils, skim it very carefully, cover the pan closely, and let it simmer very gently for an hour; strain it, let it cool, take off all the fat from the surface, and warm up as much as may be required, adding, if the patient be allowed to take it, a teaspoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded.
10136-8{_}24922{_}Pearl barley or rice are very nice additions to mutton broth, and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients.
10136-8{_}24923{_}When either of these is added, the broth must not be strained, but merely thoroughly skimmed.
10136-8{_}24924{_}Plain mutton broth without seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton, water, and salt together, straining it, letting the broth cool, skimming all the fat off, and warming up as much as is required.
10136-8{_}24925{_}This preparation would be very tasteless and insipid, but likely to agree with very delicate stomachs, whereas the least addition of other ingredients would have the contrary effect.
10136-8{_}24926{_}_Time_.--1 hour.
10136-8{_}24927{_}_Average cost_, _7d._  _Sufficient_ to make from 1-1/2 to 2 pints of broth.
10136-8{_}24928{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}24929{_}_Note_.--Veal broth may be made in the same manner; the knuckle of a leg or shoulder is the part usually used for this purpose.
10136-8{_}24930{_}It is very good with the addition of the inferior joints of a fowl, or a few shank-bones.
10136-8{_}24931{_}MUTTON BROTH, QUICKLY MADE.
10136-8{_}24932{_}1873.
10136-8{_}24933{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 chops from a neck of mutton, 1 pint of water, a small bunch of sweet herbs, 1/4 of an onion, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}24934{_}_Mode_.--Cut the meat into small pieces, put it into a saucepan with the bones, but no skin or fat; add the other ingredients; cover the saucepan, and bring the water quickly to boil.
10136-8{_}24935{_}Take the lid off, and continue the rapid boiling for 20 minutes, skimming it well during the process; strain the broth into a basin; if there should be any fat left on the surface, remove it by laying a piece of thin paper on the top: the greasy particles will adhere to the paper, and so free the preparation from them.
10136-8{_}24936{_}To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable than broth served with a quantity of fat floating on the top; to avoid this, it is always better to allow it to get thoroughly cool, the fat can then be so easily removed.
10136-8{_}24937{_}_Time_.--20 minutes after the water boils.
10136-8{_}24938{_}_Average cost_, 5d.
10136-8{_}24939{_}_Sufficient_ to make 1/2 pint of broth.
10136-8{_}24940{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}24941{_}STEWED RABBITS IN MILK.
10136-8{_}24942{_}1874.
10136-8{_}24943{_}INGREDIENTS.--2 very young rabbits, not nearly half grown; 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1 blade of mace, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne.
10136-8{_}24944{_}_Mode_.--Mix the flour very smoothly with 4 tablespoonfuls of the milk, and when this is well mixed, add the remainder.
10136-8{_}24945{_}Cut up the rabbits into joints, put them into a stewpan, with the milk and other ingredients, and simmer them _very gently_ until quite tender.
10136-8{_}24946{_}Stir the contents from time to time, to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning.
10136-8{_}24947{_}1/2 hour will be sufficient for the cooking of this dish.
10136-8{_}24948{_}_Time_.--1/2 hour.
10136-8{_}24949{_}_Average cost_, from 1s.
10136-8{_}24950{_}to 1s.
10136-8{_}24951{_}6d.
10136-8{_}24952{_}each.
10136-8{_}24953{_}_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 meals.
10136-8{_}24954{_}_Seasonable_ from September to February.
10136-8{_}24955{_}RICE-MILK.
10136-8{_}24956{_}1875.
10136-8{_}24957{_}INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of rice, 1 quart of milk, sugar to taste; when liked, a little grated nutmeg.
10136-8{_}24958{_}_Mode_.--Well wash the rice, put it into a saucepan with the milk, and simmer gently until the rice is tender, stirring it from time to time to prevent the milk from burning; sweeten it, add a little grated nutmeg, and serve.
10136-8{_}24959{_}This dish is also very suitable and wholesome for children; it may be flavoured with a little lemon-peel, and a little finely-minced suet may be boiled with it, which renders it more strengthening and more wholesome.
10136-8{_}24960{_}Tapioca, semolina, vermicelli, and macaroni, may all be dressed in the same manner.
10136-8{_}24961{_}_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour.
10136-8{_}24962{_}_Seasonable_ at any time.
10136-8{_}24963{_}TO MAKE TOAST-AND-WATER.
10136-8{_}24964{_}1876.
10136-8{_}24965{_}INGREDIENTS.--A slice of bread, 1 quart of boiling water.
10136-8{_}24966{_}_Mode_.--Cut a slice from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is better than anything else for the purpose), toast it of a nice brown on every side, but _do not allow it to burn or blacken_.
10136-8{_}24967{_}Put it into a jug, pour the boiling water over it, cover it closely, and let it remain until cold.
10136-8{_}24968{_}When strained, it will be ready for use.
10136-8{_}24969{_}Toast-and-water should always be made a short time before it is required, to enable it to get cold: if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state, it is an exceedingly disagreeable beverage.
10136-8{_}24970{_}If, as is sometimes the case, this drink is wanted in a hurry, put the toasted bread into a jug, and only just cover it with the boiling water; when this is cool, cold water may be added in the proportion required,--the toast-and-water strained; it will then be ready for use, and is more expeditiously prepared than by the above method.
10136-8{_}24971{_}TOAST SANDWICHES.
10136-8{_}24972{_}1877.
10136-8{_}24973{_}INGREDIENTS.--Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and-butter, pepper and salt to taste.
10136-8{_}24974{_}_Mode_.--Place a very thin piece of cold toast between 2 slices of thin bread-and-butter in the form of a sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper and salt.
10136-8{_}24975{_}This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.
10136-8{_}24976{_}1878.
10136-8{_}24977{_}Besides the recipes contained in this chapter, there are, in the previous chapters on cookery, many others suitable for invalids, which it would be useless to repeat here.
10136-8{_}24978{_}Recipes for fish simply dressed, light soups, plain roast meat, well-dressed vegetables, poultry, simple puddings, jelly, stewed fruits, &c. &c., all of which dishes may be partaken of by invalids and convalescents, will be found in preceding chapters.
10136-8{_}24979{_}DINNERS AND DINING.
10136-8{_}24980{_}CHAPTER XL.
10136-8{_}24981{_}1879.
10136-8{_}24982{_}Man, it has been said, is a dining animal.
10136-8{_}24983{_}Creatures of the inferior races eat and drink; man only dines.
10136-8{_}24984{_}It has also been said that he is a cooking animal; but some races eat food without cooking it.
10136-8{_}24985{_}A Croat captain said to M. Brillat Savarin, "When, in campaign, we feel hungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with salt, put it under the saddle, gallop over it for half a mile, and then eat it."
10136-8{_}24986{_}Huntsmen in Dauphiny, when out shooting, have been known to kill a bird, pluck it, salt and pepper it, and cook it by carrying it some time in their caps.
10136-8{_}24987{_}It is equally true that some races of men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture.
10136-8{_}24988{_}It is not a _dinner_ at which sits the aboriginal Australian, who gnaws his bone half bare and then flings it behind to his squaw.
10136-8{_}24989{_}And the native of Terra-del-Fuego does not dine when he gets his morsel of red clay.
10136-8{_}24990{_}Dining is the privilege of civilization.
10136-8{_}24991{_}The rank which a people occupy in the grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals, as well as by their way of treating their women.
10136-8{_}24992{_}The nation which knows how to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress.
10136-8{_}24993{_}It implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order, and surround with idealisms and graces, the more material conditions of human existence; and wherever that will and that skill exist, life cannot be wholly ignoble.
10136-8{_}24994{_}1880.
10136-8{_}24995{_}Dinner, being the grand solid meal of the day, is a matter of considerable importance; and a well-served table is a striking index of human, ingenuity and resource.
10136-8{_}24996{_}"Their table," says Lord Byron, in describing a dinner-party given by Lord and Lady Amundevillo at Norman Abbey,--    "Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts   To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
10136-8{_}24997{_}I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,   Albeit all human history attests   That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!--   Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner."
10136-8{_}24998{_}And then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the results produced by human cleverness and application catering for the modifications which occur in civilized life, one of the simplest of the primal instincts:--    "The mind is lost in mighty contemplation   Of intellect expended on two courses;   And indigestion's grand multiplication   Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
10136-8{_}24999{_}Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,   That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,   As form a science and a nomenclature   From out the commonest demands of nature?"
10136-8{_}25000{_}And we may well say, Who, indeed, would suppose it?
10136-8{_}25001{_}The gulf between the Croat, with a steak under his saddle, and Alexis Soyer getting up a great dinner at the Reform-Club, or even Thackeray's Mrs. Raymond Gray giving "a little dinner" to Mr. Snob (with one of those famous "roly-poly puddings" of hers),--what a gulf it is!
10136-8{_}25002{_}1881.
10136-8{_}25003{_}That Adam's "ration," however, was "simple," is a matter on which we have contrary judgments given by the poets.
10136-8{_}25004{_}When Raphael paid that memorable visit to Paradise,--which we are expressly told by Milton he did exactly at dinner-time,--Eve seems to have prepared "a little dinner" not wholly destitute of complexity, and to have added ice-creams and perfumes.
10136-8{_}25005{_}Nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the poet on these points:--    "And Eve within, due at her home prepared   For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please   True appetite, and not disrelish thirst   Of nectarous draughts between....   .... With dispatchful looks in haste   She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent,   What choice to choose for delicacy best,   What order so contrived as not to mix   Tastes not well join'd, inelegant, but bring   Taste after taste, upheld with kindliest change--          *       *       *       *       *   "She _tempers dulcet creams_....   .... _then strews the ground   With rose and odours._"  It may be observed, in passing, that the poets, though they have more to say about wine than solid food, because the former more directly stimulates the intellect and the feelings, do not flinch from the subject of eating and drinking.
10136-8{_}25006{_}There is infinite zest in the above passage from Milton, and even more in the famous description of a dainty supper, given by Keats in his "Eve of Saint Agnes."
10136-8{_}25007{_}Could Queen Mab herself desire to sit down to anything nicer, both as to its appointments and serving, and as to its quality, than the collation served by Porphyro in the lady's bedroom while she slept?--    "There by the bedside, where the faded moon   Made a dim silver twilight, soft he set   A table, and, half-anguish'd, threw thereor   A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet.
10136-8{_}25008{_}*       *       *       *       *   "While he, from forth the closet, brought a heap   Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;   With jellies smoother than the creamy curd,   And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon;   Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd   From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,   From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon."
10136-8{_}25009{_}But Tennyson has ventured beyond dates, and quinces, and syrups, which may be thought easy to be brought in by a poet.
10136-8{_}25010{_}In his idyl of "Audley Court" he gives a most appetizing description of a pasty at a pic-nic:--    "There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid   A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound;   Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,   And, half cut down, a pasty costly made,   Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret, lay   Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks   Imbedded and injellied."
10136-8{_}25011{_}We gladly quote passages like these, to show how eating and drinking may be surrounded with poetical associations, and how man, using his privilege to turn any and every repast into a "feast of reason," with a warm and plentiful "flow of soul," may really count it as not the least of his legitimate prides, that he is "a dining animal."
10136-8{_}25012{_}1882.
10136-8{_}25013{_}It has been said, indeed, that great men, in general, are great diners.
10136-8{_}25014{_}This, however, can scarcely be true of any great men but men of action; and, in that case, it would simply imply that persons of vigorous constitution, who work hard, eat heartily; for, of course, a life of action _requires_ a vigorous constitution, even though there may be much illness, as in such cases as William III.
10136-8{_}25015{_}and our brave General Napier.
10136-8{_}25016{_}Of men of thought, it can scarcely be true that they eat so much, in a general way, though even they eat more than they are apt to suppose they do; for, as Mr. Lewes observes, "nerve-tissue is very expensive."
10136-8{_}25017{_}Leaving great men of all kinds, however, to get their own dinners, let us, who are not great, look after ours.
10136-8{_}25018{_}Dine we must, and we may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely.
10136-8{_}25019{_}1883.
10136-8{_}25020{_}There are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days, and they were not wanting in ancient times.
10136-8{_}25021{_}It is well known that the dinner-party, or symposium, was a not unimportant, and not unpoetical, feature in the life of the sociable, talkative, tasteful Greek.
10136-8{_}25022{_}Douglas Jerrold said that such is the British humour for dining and giving of dinners, that if London were to be destroyed by an earthquake, the Londoners would meet at a public dinner to consider the subject.
10136-8{_}25023{_}The Greeks, too, were great diners: their social and religious polity gave them many chances of being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking.
10136-8{_}25024{_}Any public or even domestic sacrifice to one of the gods, was sure to be followed by a dinner-party, the remains of the slaughtered "offering" being served up on the occasion as a pious _pièce de résistance;_ and as the different gods, goddesses, and demigods, worshipped by the community in general, or by individuals, were very numerous indeed, and some very religious people never let a day pass without offering up something or other, the dinner-parties were countless.
10136-8{_}25025{_}A birthday, too, was an excuse for a dinner; a birthday, that is, of any person long dead and buried, as well as of a living person, being a member of the family, or otherwise esteemed.
10136-8{_}25026{_}Dinners were, of course, eaten on all occasions of public rejoicing.
10136-8{_}25027{_}Then, among the young people, subscription dinners, very much after the manner of modern times, were always being got up; only that they would be eaten not at an hotel, but probably at the house of one of the _heterae_.
10136-8{_}25028{_}A Greek dinner-party was a handsome, well-regulated affair.
10136-8{_}25029{_}The guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned with flowers.
10136-8{_}25030{_}A slave, approaching each person as he entered, took off his sandals and washed his feet.
10136-8{_}25031{_}During the repast, the guests reclined on couches with pillows, among and along which were set small tables.
10136-8{_}25032{_}After the solid meal came the "symposium" proper, a scene of music, merriment, and dancing, the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls.
10136-8{_}25033{_}There was a chairman, or symposiarch, appointed by the company to regulate the drinking; and it was his duty to mix the wine in the "mighty bowl."
10136-8{_}25034{_}From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets, and, with the goblets, went round and round the tables, filling the cups of the guests.
10136-8{_}25035{_}1884.
10136-8{_}25036{_}The elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which depends, of course, partly upon the means, but still more upon the taste of the master and mistress of the house.
10136-8{_}25037{_}It may be observed, in general, that there should always be flowers on the table, and as they form no item of expense, there is no reason why they should not be employed every day.
10136-8{_}25038{_}1885.
10136-8{_}25039{_}The variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern dinner-table, does not necessarily imply anything unwholesome, or anything capricious.
10136-8{_}25040{_}Food that is not well relished cannot be well digested; and the appetite of the over-worked man of business, or statesman, or of any dweller in towns, whose occupations are exciting and exhausting, is jaded, and requires stimulation.
10136-8{_}25041{_}Men and women who are in rude health, and who have plenty of air and exercise, eat the simplest food with relish, and consequently digest it well; but those conditions are out of the reach of many men.
10136-8{_}25042{_}They must suit their mode of dining to their mode of living, if they cannot choose the latter.
10136-8{_}25043{_}It is in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the skill of the modern housewife is severely tasked; and she has scarcely a more important duty to fulfil.
10136-8{_}25044{_}It is, in fact, her particular vocation, in virtue of which she may be said to hold the health of the family, and of the friends of the family, in her hands from day to day.
10136-8{_}25045{_}It has been said that "the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they are fed;" and a great gastronomist exclaims, "Tell me what kind of food you eat, and I will tell you what kind of man you are."
10136-8{_}25046{_}The same writer has some sentences of the same kind, which are rather hyperbolical, but worth quoting:--"The pleasures of the table belong to all ages, to all conditions, to all countries, and to all eras; they mingle with all other pleasures, and remain, at last, to console us for their departure.
10136-8{_}25047{_}The discovery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than the discovery of a new star."
10136-8{_}25048{_}1886.
10136-8{_}25049{_}The gastronomist from whom we have already quoted, has some aphorisms and short directions in relation to dinner-parties, which are well deserving of notice:--"Let the number of your guests never exceed twelve, so that the conversation may be general.
10136-8{_}25050{_}[Footnote: We have seen this varied by saying that the number should never exceed that of the Muses or fall below that of the Graces.]
10136-8{_}25051{_}Let the temperature of the dining-room be about 68°.
10136-8{_}25052{_}Let the dishes be few in number in the first course, but proportionally good.
10136-8{_}25053{_}The order of food is from the most substantial to the lightest.
10136-8{_}25054{_}The order of drinking wine is from the mildest to the most foamy and most perfumed.
10136-8{_}25055{_}To invite a person to your house is to take charge of his happiness so long as he is beneath your roof.
10136-8{_}25056{_}The mistress of the house should always be certain that the coffee be excellent; whilst the master should be answerable for the quality of his wines and liqueurs."

10136-8{_}28097{_}Where, however, a service à la Russe is practicable, there it, perhaps, no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this.
10136-8{_}28098{_}SUPPERS.
10136-8{_}28099{_}2139.
10136-8{_}28100{_}Much may be done in the arrangement of a supper-table, at a very small expense, provided _taste_ and _ingenuity_ are exercised.
10136-8{_}28101{_}The colours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast nicely; there should be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table, and the room should be well lighted.
10136-8{_}28102{_}We have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may be placed; but of course these little matters entirely depend on the length and width of the table used, on individual taste, whether the tables are arranged round the room, whether down the centre, with a cross one at the top, or whether the supper is laid in two separate rooms, &c. &c. The garnishing of the dishes has also much to do with the appearance of a supper-table.
10136-8{_}28103{_}Hams and tongues should be ornamented with cut vegetable flowers, raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice, and all the dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd.
10136-8{_}28104{_}The eye, in fact, should be as much gratified as the palate.
10136-8{_}28105{_}Hot soup is now often served at suppers, but is not placed on the table.
10136-8{_}28106{_}The servants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet, and then hand them to the guests: when these plates are removed, the business of supper commences.
10136-8{_}28107{_}2140.
10136-8{_}28108{_}Where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing supper, many things enumerated in the following bill of fare may be placed on the buffet.
10136-8{_}28109{_}Dishes for these suppers should be selected which may be eaten standing without any trouble.
10136-8{_}28110{_}The following list may, perhaps, assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a standing supper.
10136-8{_}28111{_}2141.
10136-8{_}28112{_}Beef, ham, and tongue sandwiches, lobster and oyster patties, sausage rolls, meat rolls, lobster salad, dishes of fowls, the latter _all cut up_; dishes of sliced ham, sliced tongue, sliced beef, and galantine of veal; various jellies, blancmanges, and creams; custards in glasses, compôtes of fruit, tartlets of jam, and several dishes of small fancy pastry; dishes of fresh fruit, bonbons, sweetmeats, two or three sponge cakes, a few plates of biscuits, and the buffet ornamented with vases of fresh or artificial flowers.
10136-8{_}28113{_}The above dishes are quite sufficient for a standing supper; where more are desired, a supper must then be laid and arranged in the usual manner.

10136-8{_}28232{_}Dish of Lobster, cut up.
10136-8{_}28233{_}_Note_.--The length of the page will not admit of our giving the dishes as they should be placed on the table; they should be arranged with the large and high dishes down the centre, and the spaces filled up with the smaller dishes, fruit, and flowers, taking care that the flavours and colours contrast nicely, and that no two dishes of a sort come together.
10136-8{_}28234{_}This bill of fare may be made to answer three or four purposes, placing a wedding cake or christening cake in the centre on a high stand, if required for either of these occasions.
10136-8{_}28235{_}A few dishes of fowls, lobster salads, &c. &c., should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are most likely to be eaten first.
10136-8{_}28236{_}A joint of cold roast and boiled beef should be placed on the buffet, as being something substantial for the gentlemen of the party to partake of.
10136-8{_}28237{_}Besides the articles enumerated in the bill of fare, biscuits and wafers will be required, cream-and-water ices, tea, coffee, wines, liqueurs, soda-water, ginger-beer, and lemonade.
10136-8{_}28238{_}BREAKFASTS.
10136-8{_}28239{_}2144.
10136-8{_}28240{_}It will not be necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold joints, &c., which may be placed on the side-board, and do duty at the breakfast-table.
10136-8{_}28241{_}Suffice it to say, that any cold meat the larder may furnish, should be nicely garnished, and be placed on the buffet.
10136-8{_}28242{_}Collared and potted meats or fish, cold game or poultry, veal-and-ham pies, game-and-Rump-steak pies, are all suitable dishes for the breakfast-table; as also cold ham, tongue, &c. &c.  2145.
10136-8{_}28243{_}The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast.
10136-8{_}28244{_}Broiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks, &c.; mutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep's kidneys, kidneys à la maître d'hôtel, sausages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled eggs, oeufs-au-plat, poached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &c. &c.  2146.
10136-8{_}28245{_}In the summer, and when they are obtainable, always have a vase of freshly-gathered flowers on the breakfast-table, and, when convenient, a nicely-arranged dish of fruit: when strawberries are in season, these are particularly refreshing; as also grapes, or even currants.
10136-8{_}28246{_}LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS.
10136-8{_}28247{_}2147.
10136-8{_}28248{_}The remains of cold joints, nicely garnished, a few sweets, or a little hashed meat, poultry or game, are the usual articles placed on the table for luncheon, with bread and cheese, biscuits, butter, &c. If a substantial meal is desired, rump-steaks or mutton chops may he served, as also veal cutlets, kidneys, or any dish of that kind.
10136-8{_}28249{_}In families where there is a nursery, the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children, and makes it her luncheon.
10136-8{_}28250{_}In the summer, a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon, or, instead of this, a compote of fruit or fruit tart, or pudding.
10136-8{_}28251{_}2148.
10136-8{_}28252{_}Of suppers we have little to say, as we have already given two bills of fare for a large party, which will answer very well for a smaller number, by reducing the quantity of dishes and by omitting a few.
10136-8{_}28253{_}Hot suppers are now very little in request, as people now generally dine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper; at all events, not one of a substantial kind.
10136-8{_}28254{_}Should, however, a bill of fare be required, one of those under the head of DINNERS, with slight alterations, will be found to answer for a hot supper.
10136-8{_}28255{_}BILL OF FARE FOR A PICNIC FOR 40 PERSONS.
10136-8{_}28256{_}2149.
10136-8{_}28257{_}A joint of cold roast beef, a joint of cold boiled beef, 2 ribs of lamb, 2 shoulders of lamb, 4 roast fowls, 2 roast ducks, 1 ham, 1 tongue, 2 veal-and-ham pies, 2 pigeon pies, 6 medium-sized lobsters, 1 piece of collared calf's head, 18 lettuces, 6 baskets of salad, 6 cucumbers.
10136-8{_}28258{_}2150.
10136-8{_}28259{_}Stewed fruit well sweetened, and put into glass bottles well corked; 3 or 4 dozen plain pastry biscuits to eat with the stewed fruit, 2 dozen fruit turnovers, 4 dozen cheesecakes, 2 cold cabinet puddings in moulds, 2 blancmanges in moulds, a few jam puffs, 1 large cold plum-pudding (this must be good), a few baskets of fresh fruit, 3 dozen plain biscuits, a piece of cheese, 6 lbs.
10136-8{_}28260{_}of butter (this, of course, includes the butter for tea), 4 quartern loaves of household broad, 3 dozen rolls, 6 loaves of tin bread (for tea), 2 plain plum cakes, 2 pound cakes, 2 sponge cakes, a tin of mixed biscuits, 1/2 lb, of tea.
10136-8{_}28261{_}Coffee is not suitable for a picnic, being difficult to make.
10136-8{_}28262{_}Things not to be forgotten at a Picnic.
10136-8{_}28263{_}2151.
10136-8{_}28264{_}A stick of horseradish, a bottle of mint-sauce well corked, a bottle of salad dressing, a bottle of vinegar, made mustard, pepper, salt, good oil, and pounded sugar.
10136-8{_}28265{_}If it can be managed, take a little ice.
10136-8{_}28266{_}It is scarcely necessary to say that plates, tumblers, wine-glasses, knives, forks, and spoons, must not be forgotten; as also teacups and saucers, 3 or 4 teapots, some lump sugar, and milk, if this last-named article cannot be obtained in the neighbourhood.
10136-8{_}28267{_}Take 3 corkscrews.
10136-8{_}28268{_}2152.
10136-8{_}28269{_}_Beverages_.--3 dozen quart bottles of ale, packed in hampers; ginger-beer, soda-water, and lemonade, of each 2 dozen bottles; 6 bottles of sherry, 6 bottles of claret, champagne à discrétion, and any other light wine that may be preferred, and 2 bottles of brandy.
10136-8{_}28270{_}Water can usually be obtained so it is useless to take it.
10136-8{_}28271{_}DOMESTIC SERVANTS.
10136-8{_}28272{_}CHAPTER XLI.
10136-8{_}28273{_}2153.
10136-8{_}28274{_}It is the custom of "Society" to abuse its servants,--_a façon de parler_, such as leads their lords and masters to talk of the weather, and, when rurally inclined, of the crops,--leads matronly ladies, and ladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable state, to talk of servants, and, as we are told, wax eloquent over the greatest plague in life while taking a quiet cup of tea.
10136-8{_}28275{_}Young men at their clubs, also, we are told, like to abuse their "fellows," perhaps not without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of intimating that they enjoy such appendages to their state.
10136-8{_}28276{_}It is another conviction of "Society" that the race of good servants has died out, at least in England, although they do order these things better in France; that there is neither honesty, conscientiousness, nor the careful and industrious habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers; that domestics no longer know their place; that the introduction of cheap silks and cottons, and, still more recently, those ambiguous "materials" and tweeds, have removed the landmarks between the mistress and her maid, between the master and his man.
10136-8{_}28277{_}2154.
10136-8{_}28278{_}When the distinction really depends on things so insignificant, this is very probably the case; when the lady of fashion chooses her footman without any other consideration than his height, shape, and _tournure_ of his calf, it is not surprising that she should find a domestic who has no attachment for the family, who considers the figure he cuts behind her carriage, and the late hours he is compelled to keep, a full compensation for the wages he exacts, for the food he wastes, and for the perquisites he can lay his hands on.
10136-8{_}28279{_}Nor should the fast young man, who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf and in the tricks of low horse-dealers, be surprised if he is sometimes the victim of these learned ways.
10136-8{_}28280{_}But these are the exceptional cases, which prove the existence of a better state of things.
10136-8{_}28281{_}The great masses of society among us are not thus deserted; there are few families of respectability, from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman whose mansion dignifies the next square, which do not contain among their dependents attached and useful servants; and where these are absent altogether, there are good reasons for it.
10136-8{_}28282{_}The sensible master and the kind mistress know, that if servants depend on them for their means of living, in their turn they are dependent on their servants for very many of the comforts of life; and that, with a proper amount of care in choosing servants, and treating them like reasonable beings, and making slight excuses for the shortcomings of human nature, they will, save in some exceptional case, be tolerably well served, and, in most instances, surround themselves with attached domestics.
10136-8{_}28283{_}2155.
10136-8{_}28284{_}This remark, which is applicable to all domestics, is especially so to men-servants.
10136-8{_}28285{_}Families accustomed to such attendants have always about them humble dependents, whose children have no other prospect than domestic service to look forward to; to them it presents no degradation, but the reverse, to be so employed; they are initiated step by step into the mysteries of the household, with the prospect of rising in the service, if it is a house admitting of promotion,--to the respectable position of butler or house-steward.
10136-8{_}28286{_}In families of humbler pretensions, where they must look for promotion elsewhere, they know that can only be attained by acquiring the goodwill of their employers.
10136-8{_}28287{_}Can there be any stronger security for their good conduct,--any doubt that, in the mass of domestic servants, good conduct is the rule, the reverse the exception?
10136-8{_}28288{_}2156.
10136-8{_}28289{_}The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer.
10136-8{_}28290{_}The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.
10136-8{_}28291{_}DUTIES OF THE BUTLER.
10136-8{_}28292{_}2157.
10136-8{_}28293{_}The domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at breakfast, and wait upon the family at that meal, assisted by the footman, and see to the cleanliness of everything at table.
10136-8{_}28294{_}On taking away, he removes the tray with the china and plate, for which he is responsible.
10136-8{_}28295{_}At luncheon, he arranges the meal, and waits unassisted, the footman being now engaged in other duties.
10136-8{_}28296{_}At dinner, he places the silver and plated articles on the table, sees that everything is in its place, and rectifies what is wrong.
10136-8{_}28297{_}He carries in the first dish, and announces in the drawing-room that dinner is on the table, and respectfully stands by the door until the company are seated, when he takes his place behind his master's chair on the left, to remove the covers, handing them to the other attendants to carry out.
10136-8{_}28298{_}After the first course of plates is supplied, his place is at the sideboard to serve the wines, but only when called on.
10136-8{_}28299{_}2158.
10136-8{_}28300{_}The first course ended, he rings the cook's bell, and hands the dishes from the table to the other servants to carry away, receiving from them the second course, which he places on the table, removing the covers as before, and again taking his place at the sideboard.
10136-8{_}28301{_}2159.
10136-8{_}28302{_}At dessert, the slips being removed, the butler receives the dessert from the other servants, and arranges it on the table, with plates and glasses, and then takes his place behind his master's chair to hand the wines and ices, while the footman stands behind his mistress for the same purpose, the other attendants leaving the room.
10136-8{_}28303{_}Where the old-fashioned practice of having the dessert on the polished table, without any cloth, is still adhered to, the butler should rub off any marks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert.
10136-8{_}28304{_}2160.
10136-8{_}28305{_}Before dinner, he has satisfied himself that the lamps, candles, or gas-burners are in perfect order, if not lighted, which will usually be the case.
10136-8{_}28306{_}Having served every one with their share of the dessert, put the fires in order (when these are used), and seen the lights are all right, at a signal from his master, he and the footman leave the room.
10136-8{_}28307{_}2161.
10136-8{_}28308{_}He now proceeds to the drawing-room, arranges the fireplace, and sees to the lights; he then returns to his pantry, prepared to answer the bell, and attend to the company, while the footman is clearing away and cleaning the plate and glasses.
10136-8{_}28309{_}2162.
10136-8{_}28310{_}At tea he again attends.
10136-8{_}28311{_}At bedtime he appears with the candles; he locks up the plate, secures doors and windows, and sees that all the fires are safe.
10136-8{_}28312{_}2163.
10136-8{_}28313{_}In addition to these duties, the butler, where only one footman is kept, will be required to perform some of the duties of the valet, to pay bills, and superintend the other servants.
10136-8{_}28314{_}But the real duties of the butler are in the wine-cellar; there he should be competent to advise his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in; "fine," bottle, cork, and seal it, and place it in the binns.
10136-8{_}28315{_}Brewing, racking, and bottling malt liquors, belong to his office, as well as their distribution.
10136-8{_}28316{_}These and other drinkables are brought from the cellar every day by his own hands, except where an under-butler is kept; and a careful entry of every bottle used, entered in the cellar-book; so that the book should always show the contents of the cellar.
10136-8{_}28317{_}2164.
10136-8{_}28318{_}The office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a     household.
10136-8{_}28319{_}Here, as elsewhere, honesty is the best policy: the     butler should make it his business to understand the proper     treatment of the different wines under his charge, which he can     easily do from the wine-merchant, and faithfully attend to it;     his own reputation will soon compensate for the absence of     bribes from unprincipled wine-merchants, if he serves a generous     and hospitable master.
10136-8{_}28320{_}Nothing spreads more rapidly in society     than the reputation of a good wine-cellar, and all that is     required is wines well chosen and well cared for; and this a     little knowledge, carefully applied, will soon supply.
10136-8{_}28321{_}2165.
10136-8{_}28322{_}The butler, we have said, has charge of the contents of the cellars, and it is his duty to keep them in a proper condition, to fine down wine in wood, bottle it off, and store it away in places suited to the sorts.
10136-8{_}28323{_}Where wine comes into the cellar ready bottled, it is usual to return the same number of empty bottles; the butler has not, in this case, the same inducements to keep the bottles of the different sorts separated; but where the wine is bottled in the house, he will find his account, not only in keeping them separate, but in rinsing them well, and even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty.
10136-8{_}28324{_}2166.
10136-8{_}28325{_}There are various modes of fining wine: isinglass,     gelatine, and gum Arabic are all used for the purpose.
10136-8{_}28326{_}Whichever     of these articles is used, the process is always the same.
10136-8{_}28327{_}Supposing eggs (the cheapest) to be used,--Draw a gallon or so     of the wine, and mix one quart of it with the whites of four     eggs, by stirring it with a whisk; afterwards, when thoroughly     mixed, pour it back into the cask through the bunghole, and stir     up the whole cask, in a rotatory direction, with a clean split     stick inserted through the bunghole.
10136-8{_}28328{_}Having stirred it     sufficiently, pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off, until     the cask is full; then stir again, skimming off the bubbles that     rise to the surface.
10136-8{_}28329{_}When thoroughly mixed by stirring, close     the bunghole, and leave it to stand for three or four days.
10136-8{_}28330{_}This     quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or     sherry.
10136-8{_}28331{_}The other clearing ingredients are applied in the same     manner, the material being cut into small pieces, and dissolved     in the quart of wine, and the cask stirred in the same manner.
10136-8{_}28332{_}2167.
10136-8{_}28333{_}_To Bottle Wine_.--Having thoroughly washed and dried the     bottles, supposing they have been before used for the same kind     of wine, provide corks, which will be improved by being slightly     boiled, or at least steeped in hot water,--a wooden hammer or     mallet, a bottling-boot, and a squeezer for the corks.
10136-8{_}28334{_}Bore a     hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet, receiving the     liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer, which is     placed in a tub or basin.
10136-8{_}28335{_}This operation is best performed by     two persons, one to draw the wine, the other to cork the     bottles.
10136-8{_}28336{_}The drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the     mark, but not too full, the bottle being placed in a clean tub     to prevent waste.
10136-8{_}28337{_}The corking-boot is buckled by a strap to the     knee, the bottle placed in it, and the cork, after being     squeezed in the press, driven in by a flat wooden mallet.
10136-8{_}28338{_}2168.
10136-8{_}28339{_}As the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask, a thick     piece of muslin is placed in the strainer, to prevent the     viscous grounds from passing into the bottle.
10136-8{_}28340{_}2169.
10136-8{_}28341{_}Having carefully counted the bottles, they are stored away     in their respective binns, a layer of sand or sawdust being     placed under the first tier, and another over it; a second tier     is laid over this, protected by a lath, the head of the second     being laid to the bottom of the first; over this another bed of     sawdust is laid, not too thick, another lath; and so on till the     binn is filled.
10136-8{_}28342{_}2170.
10136-8{_}28343{_}Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its     quality and age.
10136-8{_}28344{_}Port wine, old in the wood, will be ready to     drink in five or six months; but if it is a fruity wine, it will     improve every year.
10136-8{_}28345{_}Sherry, if of good quality, will be fit to     drink as soon as the "sickness" (as its first condition after     bottling is called) ceases, and will also improve; but the     cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature, neither     too hot nor too cold, but about 55° or 60°, and absolutely free     from draughts of cold air.
10136-8{_}28346{_}DUTIES OF THE FOOTMAN.
10136-8{_}28347{_}2171.
10136-8{_}28348{_}Where a single footman, or odd man, is the only male servant, then, whatever his ostensible position, he is required to make himself generally useful.
10136-8{_}28349{_}He has to clean the knives and shoes, the furniture, the plate; answer the visitors who call, the drawing-room and parlour bells; and do all the errands.
10136-8{_}28350{_}His life is no sinecure; and a methodical arrangement of his time will be necessary, in order to perform his many duties with any satisfaction to himself or his master.
10136-8{_}28351{_}2172.
10136-8{_}28352{_}The footman only finds himself in stockings, shoes, and     washing.
10136-8{_}28353{_}Where silk stockings, or other extra articles of linen     are worn, they are found by the family, as well as his livery, a     working dress, consisting of a pair of overalls, a waistcoat, a     fustian jacket, with a white or jean one for times when he is     liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast;     and, on quitting his service, he is expected to leave behind him     any livery had within six months.
10136-8{_}28354{_}2173.
10136-8{_}28355{_}The footman is expected to rise early, in order to get through all his dirty work before the family are stirring.
10136-8{_}28356{_}Boots and shoes, and knives and forks, should be cleaned, lamps in use trimmed, his master's clothes brushed, the furniture rubbed over; so that he may put aside his working dress, tidy himself, and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay the cloth and prepare breakfast for the family.
10136-8{_}28357{_}2174.
10136-8{_}28358{_}We need hardly dwell on the boot-cleaning process: three     good brushes and good blacking must be provided; one of the     brushes hard, to brush off the mud; the other soft, to lay on     the blacking; the third of a medium hardness, for polishing; and     each should be kept for its particular use.
10136-8{_}28359{_}The blacking should     be kept corked up, except when in use, and applied to the brush     with a sponge tied to a stick, which, when put away, rests in a     notch cut in the cork.
10136-8{_}28360{_}When boots come in very muddy, it is a     good practice to wash off the mud, and wipe them dry with a     sponge; then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides,     taking care they are not placed near the fire, or scorched.
10136-8{_}28361{_}Much     delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies' boots, so     as to make the leather look well-polished, and the upper part     retain a fresh appearance, with the lining free from hand-marks,     which are very offensive to a lady of refined tastes.
10136-8{_}28362{_}2175.
10136-8{_}28363{_}Patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet     sponge, and afterwards with a soft dry cloth, and occasionally     with a soft cloth and sweet oil, blacking and polishing the edge     of the soles in the usual way, but so as not to cover the patent     polish with blacking.
10136-8{_}28364{_}A little milk may also be used with very     good effect for patent leather boots.
10136-8{_}28365{_}2176.
10136-8{_}28366{_}Top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen.
10136-8{_}28367{_}While     cleaning the lower part in the usual manner, protect the tops,     by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing     it over them.
10136-8{_}28368{_}In cleaning the tops, let the covering fall down     over the boot; wash the tops clean with soap and flannel, and     rub out any spots with pumice-stone.
10136-8{_}28369{_}If the tops are to be     whiter, dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of     pumice-stone in a pint of soft water; if a brown colour is     intended, mix an ounce of muriatic acid, half an ounce of alum,     half an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of spirit of     lavender, in a pint and a half of skimmed milk "turned."
10136-8{_}28370{_}These     mixtures apply by means of a sponge, and polish, when dry, with     a rubber made of soft flannel.
10136-8{_}28371{_}2177.
10136-8{_}28372{_}Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent's or     Masters's machine, which gives very little trouble, and is very     effective; before, however, putting the knives into the machine,     it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little     warm (not hot) water, and then thoroughly wiped: if put into the     machine with any grease on them, it adheres to the brushes, and     consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that     may be put in.
10136-8{_}28373{_}When this precaution is not taken, the machine     must come to pieces, so causing an immense amount of trouble,     which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free     from grease before using the machine.
10136-8{_}28374{_}Brushes are also used for     cleaning forks, which facilitate the operation.
10136-8{_}28375{_}When knives are     so cleaned, see that they are carefully polished, wiped, and     with a good edge, the ferules and prongs free from dirt, and     place them in the basket with the handles all one way.
10136-8{_}28376{_}2178.
10136-8{_}28377{_}Lamp-trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the     mechanism; after that, constant attention to cleanliness, and an     occasional entire clearing out with hot water: when this is     done, all the parts should be carefully dried before filling     again with oil.
10136-8{_}28378{_}When lacquered, wipe the lacquered parts with a     soft brush and cloth, and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds,     wiping carefully afterwards.
10136-8{_}28379{_}Brass lamps may be cleaned with oil     and rottenstone every day when trimmed.
10136-8{_}28380{_}With bronze, and other     ornamental lamps, more care will be required, and soft flannel     and oil only used, to prevent the removal of the bronze or     enamel.
10136-8{_}28381{_}Brass-work, or any metal-work not lacquered, is cleaned     by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste, or with fine     emery-powder and oil mixed in the same manner.
10136-8{_}28382{_}A small portion     of sal ammoniac, beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft     water, rubbed over brass ornaments, and heated over a charcoal     fire, and rubbed dry with bran or whitening, will give to     brass-work the brilliancy of gold.
10136-8{_}28383{_}In trimming moderator lamps,     let the wick be cut evenly all round; as, if left higher in one     place than it is in another, it will cause it to smoke and burn     badly.
10136-8{_}28384{_}The lamp should then be filled with oil from a feeder,     and afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept for the     purpose.
10136-8{_}28385{_}If it can be avoided, never wash the chimneys of a     lamp, as it causes them to crack when they become hot.
10136-8{_}28386{_}Small     sticks, covered with wash-leather pads, are the best things to     use for cleaning the glasses inside, and a clean duster for     polishing the outside.
10136-8{_}28387{_}The globe of a moderator lamp should be     occasionally washed in warm soap-and-water, then well rinsed in     cold water, and either wiped dry or left to drain.
10136-8{_}28388{_}Where     candle-lamps are used, take out the springs occasionally, and     free them well from the grease that adheres to them.
10136-8{_}28389{_}2179.
10136-8{_}28390{_}French polish, so universally applied to furniture, is     easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft     cloth, or a rubber of old silk; but dining-tables can only be     kept in order by hard rubbing, or rather by quick rubbing, which     warms the wood and removes all spots.
10136-8{_}28391{_}2180.
10136-8{_}28392{_}Brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary     operation.
10136-8{_}28393{_}Fine cloths require to be brushed lightly, and with     rather a soft brush, except where mud is to be removed, when a     hard one is necessary, being previously beaten lightly to     dislodge the dirt.
10136-8{_}28394{_}Lay the garment on a table, and brush it in     the direction of the nap.
10136-8{_}28395{_}Having brushed it properly, turn the     sleeves back to the collar, so that the folds may come at the     elbow-joints; next turn the lappels or sides back over the     folded sleeves; then lay the skirts over level with the collar,     so that the crease may fall about the centre, and double one     half over the other, so as the fold comes in the centre of the     back.
10136-8{_}28396{_}2181.
10136-8{_}28397{_}Having got through his dirty work, the single footman has now to clean himself and prepare the breakfast.
10136-8{_}28398{_}He lays the cloth on the table; over it the breakfast-cloth, and sets the breakfast things in order, and then proceeds to wait upon his master, if he has any of the duties of a valet to perform.
10136-8{_}28399{_}2182.
10136-8{_}28400{_}Where a valet is not kept, a portion of his duties falls to the footman's share,--brushing the clothes among others.
10136-8{_}28401{_}When the hat is silk, it requires brushing every day with a soft brush; after rain, it requires wiping the way of the nap before drying, and, when nearly dry, brushing with the soft brush and with the hat-stick in it.
10136-8{_}28402{_}If the footman is required to perform any part of a valet's duties, he will have to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressing-room in due time; that the room is dusted and cleaned; that the washhand-ewer is filled with soft water; and that the bath, whether hot or cold, is ready when required; that towels are at hand; that hair-brushes and combs are properly cleansed, and in their places; that hot water is ready at the hour ordered; the dressing-gown and slippers in their place, the clean linen aired, and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper places.
10136-8{_}28403{_}After the master has dressed, it will be the footman's duty to restore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry, and the whole restored to order.
10136-8{_}28404{_}2183.
10136-8{_}28405{_}At breakfast, when there is no butler, the footman carries up the tea-urn, and, assisted by the housemaid, he waits during breakfast.
10136-8{_}28406{_}Breakfast over, he removes the tray and other things off the table, folds up the breakfast-cloth, and sets the room in order, by sweeping up all crumbs, shaking the cloth, and laying it on the table again, making up the fire, and sweeping up the hearth.
10136-8{_}28407{_}2184.
10136-8{_}28408{_}At luncheon-time nearly the same routine is observed, except where the footman is either out with the carriage or away on other business, when, in the absence of any butler, the housemaid must assist.
10136-8{_}28409{_}2185.
10136-8{_}28410{_}For dinner, the footman lays the cloth, taking care that the table is not too near the fire, if there is one, and that passage-room is left.
10136-8{_}28411{_}A tablecloth should be laid without a wrinkle; and this requires two persons: over this the slips are laid, which are usually removed preparatory to placing dessert on the table.
10136-8{_}28412{_}He prepares knives, forks, and glasses, with five or six plates for each person.
10136-8{_}28413{_}This done, he places chairs enough for the party, distributing them equally on each side of the table, and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded, within it a piece of bread or small roll, and a knife on the right side of each plate, a fork on the left, and a carving-knife and fork at the top and bottom of the table, outside the others, with the rests opposite to them, and a gravy-spoon beside the knife.
10136-8{_}28414{_}The fish-slice should be at the top, where the lady of the house, with the assistance of the gentleman next to her, divides the fish, and the soup-ladle at the bottom: it is sometimes usual to add a dessert-knife and fork; at the same time, on the right side also of each plate, put a wine-glass for as many kinds of wine as it is intended to hand round, and a finger-glass or glass-cooler about four inches from the edge.
10136-8{_}28415{_}The latter are frequently put on the table with the dessert.
10136-8{_}28416{_}2186.
10136-8{_}28417{_}About half an hour before dinner, he rings the dinner-bell, where that is the practice, and occupies himself with carrying up everything he is likely to require.
10136-8{_}28418{_}At the expiration of the time, having communicated with the cook, he rings the real dinner-bell, and proceeds to take it up with such assistance as he can obtain.
10136-8{_}28419{_}Having ascertained that all is in order, that his own dress is clean and presentable, and his white cotton gloves are without a stain, he announces in the drawing-room that dinner is served, and stands respectfully by the door until the company are seated: he places himself on the left, behind his master, who is to distribute the soup; where soup and fish are served together, his place will be at his mistress's left hand; but he must be on the alert to see that whoever is assisting him, whether male or female, are at their posts.
10136-8{_}28420{_}If any of the guests has brought his own servant with him, his place is behind his master's chair, rendering such assistance to others as he can, while attending to his master's wants throughout the dinner, so that every guest has what he requires.
10136-8{_}28421{_}This necessitates both activity and intelligence, and should be done without bustle, without asking any questions, except where it is the custom of the house to hand round dishes or wine, when it will be necessary to mention, in a quiet and unobtrusive manner, the dish or wine you present.
10136-8{_}28422{_}2187.
10136-8{_}28423{_}Salt-cellars should be placed on the table in number     sufficient for the guests, so that each may help themselves, or,     at least, their immediate neighbours.
10136-8{_}28424{_}DINNERS À LA RUSSE.
10136-8{_}28425{_}2188.
10136-8{_}28426{_}In some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass,     and ornamented with flowers, the dessert only being placed on     the table, the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard, and     handed round in succession, in courses of soup, fish, entries,     meat, game, and sweets.
10136-8{_}28427{_}This is not only elegant but economical,     as fewer dishes are required, the symmetry of the table being     made up with the ornaments and dessert.
10136-8{_}28428{_}The various dishes are     also handed round when hot; but it involves additional and     superior attendance, as the wines are also handed round; and     unless the servants are very active and intelligent, many     blunders are likely to be made.

10136-8{_}28431{_}GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
10136-8{_}28432{_}2189.
10136-8{_}28433{_}While attentive to all, the footman should be obtrusive to none; he should give nothing but on a waiter, and always hand it with the left hand and on the left side of the person he serves, and hold it so that the guest may take it with ease.
10136-8{_}28434{_}In lifting dishes from the table, he should use both hands, and remove them with care, so that nothing is spilt on the table-cloth or on the dresses of the guests.
10136-8{_}28435{_}2190.
10136-8{_}28436{_}Masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes; but it is not expected that a servant will correct any omissions, even if he should have time to notice them, although with the best intentions: thus it would not be correct, for instance, if he observed that his master took wine with the ladies all round, as some gentlemen still continue to do, but stopped at some one:--to nudge him on the shoulder and say, as was done by the servant of a Scottish gentleman, "What ails you at her in the green gown?"
10136-8{_}28437{_}It will be better to leave the lady unnoticed than for the servant thus to turn his master into ridicule.
10136-8{_}28438{_}2191.
10136-8{_}28439{_}During dinner each person's knife, fork, plate, and spoon should be changed as soon as he has done with it; the vegetables and sauces belonging to the different dishes presented without remark to the guests; and the footman should tread lightly in moving round, and, if possible, should bear in mind, if there is a wit or humorist of the party, whose good things keep the table in a roar, that they are not expected to reach his ears.
10136-8{_}28440{_}2192.
10136-8{_}28441{_}In opening wine, let it be done quietly, and without     shaking the bottle; if crusted, let it be inclined to the     crusted side, and decanted while in that position.
10136-8{_}28442{_}In opening     champagne, it is not necessary to discharge it with a pop;     properly cooled, the cork is easily extracted without an     explosion; when the cork is out, the mouth of the bottle should     be wiped with the napkin over the footman's arm.
10136-8{_}28443{_}2193.
10136-8{_}28444{_}At the end of the first course, notice is conveyed to the cook, who is waiting to send up the second, which is introduced in the same way as before; the attendants who remove the fragments, carrying the dishes from the kitchen, and handing them to the footman or butler, whose duty it is to arrange them on the table.
10136-8{_}28445{_}After dinner, the dessert-glasses and wines are placed on the table by the footman, who places himself behind his master's chair, to supply wine and hand round the ices and other refreshments, all other servants leaving the room.
10136-8{_}28446{_}2194.
10136-8{_}28447{_}As soon as the drawing-room bell rings for tea, the footman enters with the tray, which has been previously prepared; hands the tray round to the company, with cream and sugar, the tea and coffee being generally poured out, while another attendant hands cakes, toast, or biscuits.
10136-8{_}28448{_}If it is an ordinary family party, where this social meal is prepared by the mistress, he carries the urn or kettle, as the case may be; hands round the toast, or such other eatable as may be required, removing the whole in the same manner when tea is over.
10136-8{_}28449{_}2195.
10136-8{_}28450{_}After each meal, the footman's place is in his pantry:     here perfect order should prevail--a place for everything and     everything in its place.
10136-8{_}28451{_}A sink, with hot and cold water laid     on, is very desirable,--cold absolutely necessary.
10136-8{_}28452{_}Wooden bowls     or tubs of sufficient capacity are required, one for hot and     another for cold water.
10136-8{_}28453{_}Have the bowl three parts full of clean     hot water; in this wash all plate and plated articles which are     greasy, wiping them before cleaning with the brush.
10136-8{_}28454{_}2196.
10136-8{_}28455{_}The footman in small families, where only one man is kept,     has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well     as his own, and more constant occupation; he will also have the     arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control,     and he will do well to reduce it to a methodical division.
10136-8{_}28456{_}All     his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready, when he     must appear clean, and in a presentable state.
10136-8{_}28457{_}After breakfast,     when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in     its place, the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms     requires rubbing.
10136-8{_}28458{_}Towards noon, the parlour luncheon is to be     prepared; and he must be at his mistress's disposal to go out     with the carriage, or follow her if she walks out.
10136-8{_}28459{_}2197.
10136-8{_}28460{_}Glass is a beautiful and most fragile article: hence it     requires great care in washing.
10136-8{_}28461{_}A perfectly clean wooden bowl is     best for this operation, one for moderately hot and another for     cold water.
10136-8{_}28462{_}Wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in     the second, and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or     three times, to drain for a few minutes.
10136-8{_}28463{_}When sufficiently     drained, wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one,     doing so tenderly and carefully.
10136-8{_}28464{_}Accidents will happen; but     nothing discredits a servant in the drawing-room more than     continual reports of breakages, which, of course, must reach     that region.
10136-8{_}28465{_}2198.
10136-8{_}28466{_}Decanters and water-jugs require still more tender     treatment in cleaning, inasmuch as they are more costly to     replace.
10136-8{_}28467{_}Fill them about two-thirds with hot but not boiling     water, and put in a few pieces of well-soaped brown paper; leave     them thus for two or three hours; then shake the water up and     down in the decanters; empty this out, rinse them well with     clean cold water, and put them in a rack to drain.
10136-8{_}28468{_}When dry,     polish them outside and inside, as far as possible, with a fine     cloth.
10136-8{_}28469{_}To remove the crust of port or other wines, add a little     muriatic acid to the water, and let it remain for some time.
10136-8{_}28470{_}2199.
10136-8{_}28471{_}When required to go out with the carriage, it is the footman's duty to see that it has come to the door perfectly clean, and that the glasses, and sashes, and linings, are free from dust.
10136-8{_}28472{_}In receiving messages at the carriage door, he should turn his ear to the speaker, so as to comprehend what is said, in order that he may give his directions to the coachman clearly.
10136-8{_}28473{_}When the house he is to call at is reached, he should knock, and return to the carriage for orders.
10136-8{_}28474{_}In closing the door upon the family, he should see that the handle is securely turned, and that no part of the ladies' dress is shut in.
10136-8{_}28475{_}2200.
10136-8{_}28476{_}It is the footman's duty to carry messages or letters for his master or mistress to their friends, to the post, or to the tradespeople; and nothing is more important than dispatch and exactness in doing so, although writing even the simplest message is now the ordinary and very proper practice.
10136-8{_}28477{_}Dean Swift, among his other quaint directions, all of which are to be read by contraries, recommends a perusal of all such epistles, in order that you may be the more able to fulfil your duty to your master.
10136-8{_}28478{_}An old lady of Forfarshire had one of those odd old Caleb Balderston sort of servants, who construed the Dean of St. Patrick more literally.
10136-8{_}28479{_}On one occasion, when dispatch was of some importance, knowing his inquiring nature, she called her Scotch Paul Pry to her, opened the note, and read it to him herself, saying, "Now, Andrew, you ken a' aboot it, and needna' stop to open and read it, but just take it at once."
10136-8{_}28480{_}Probably most of the notes you are expected to carry might, with equal harmlessness, be communicated to you; but it will be better not to take so lively an interest in your mistress's affairs.

10136-8{_}28482{_}Politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things masters and mistresses have a right to expect, and should exact rigorously.
10136-8{_}28483{_}When visitors present themselves, the servant charged with the duty of opening the door will open it promptly, and answer, without hesitation, if the family are "not at home," or "engaged;" which generally means the same thing, and might be oftener used with advantage to morals.
10136-8{_}28484{_}On the contrary, if he has no such orders, he will answer affirmatively, open the door wide to admit them, and precede them to open the door of the drawing-room.
10136-8{_}28485{_}If the family are not there, he will place chairs for them, open the blinds (if the room is too dark), and intimate civilly that he goes to inform his mistress.
10136-8{_}28486{_}If the lady is in her drawing-room, he announces the name of the visitors, having previously acquainted himself with it.
10136-8{_}28487{_}In this part of his duty it is necessary to be very careful to repeat the names correctly; mispronouncing names is very apt to give offence, and leads sometimes to other disagreeables.
10136-8{_}28488{_}The writer was once initiated into some of the secrets on the "other side" of a legal affair in which he took an interest, before he could correct a mistake made by the servant in announcing him.
10136-8{_}28489{_}When the visitor is departing, the servant should be at hand, ready, when rung for, to open the door; he should open it with a respectful manner, and close it gently when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold.
10136-8{_}28490{_}When several visitors arrive together, he should take care not to mix up the different names together, where they belong to the same family, as Mr., Mrs., and Miss; if they are strangers, he should announce each as distinctly as possible.
10136-8{_}28491{_}2202.
10136-8{_}28492{_}_Receptions and Evening Parties_.--The drawing-rooms being prepared, the card-tables laid out with cards and counters, and such other arrangements as are necessary made for the reception of the company, the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed approaches.
10136-8{_}28493{_}Attendants in the drawing-room, even more than in the dining-room, should move about actively but noiselessly; no creaking of shoes, which is an abomination; watching the lights from time to time, so as to keep up their brilliancy.
10136-8{_}28494{_}But even if the attendant likes a game of cribbage or whist himself, he must not interfere in his master or mistress's game, nor even seem to take an interest in it.
10136-8{_}28495{_}We once knew a lady who had a footman, and both were fond of a game of cribbage,--John in the kitchen, the lady in her drawing-room.
10136-8{_}28496{_}The lady was a giver of evening parties, where she frequently enjoyed her favourite amusement.
10136-8{_}28497{_}While handing about the tea and toast, John could not always suppress his disgust at her mistakes.
10136-8{_}28498{_}"There is more in that hand, ma'am," he has been known to say; or, "Ma'am, you forgot to count his nob;" in fact, he identified himself with his mistress's game, and would have lost twenty places rather than witness a miscount.
10136-8{_}28499{_}It is not necessary to adopt his example on this point, although John had many qualities a good servant might copy with advantage.
10136-8{_}28500{_}THE COACHHOUSE AND STABLES.
10136-8{_}28501{_}2203.
10136-8{_}28502{_}THE HORSE is the noblest of quadrupeds, whether we view     him in his strength, his sagacity, or his beauty.
10136-8{_}28503{_}He is also the     most useful to man of all the animal creation; but his delicacy     is equal to his power and usefulness.
10136-8{_}28504{_}No other animal, probably,     is so dependent on man in the state of domestication to which he     has been reduced, or deteriorates so rapidly under exposure, bad     feeding, or bad grooming.
10136-8{_}28505{_}It is, therefore, a point of humanity,     not to speak of its obvious impolicy, for the owner of horses to     overlook any neglect in their feeding or grooming.
10136-8{_}28506{_}His interest     dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed, well     fed, and well groomed; and he will do well to acquire so much of     stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself.
10136-8{_}28507{_}In a general way, where a horse's coat is habitually rough and     untidy, there is a sad want of elbow-grease in the stable.
10136-8{_}28508{_}When     a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless, he is     getting ill or badly fed; and where he is observed to perspire     much in the stables, is overfed, and probably eats his litter in     addition to his regular supply of food.
10136-8{_}28509{_}2204.
10136-8{_}28510{_}_Stables_.--The architectural form of the stables will be     subject to other influences than ours; we confine ourselves,     therefore, to their internal arrangements.
10136-8{_}28511{_}They should be roomy     in proportion to the number of stalls; warm, with good     ventilation, and perfectly free from cold draughts; the stalls     roomy, without excess, with good and well-trapped drainage, so     as to exclude bad smells; a sound ceiling to prevent the     entrance of dust from the hayloft, which is usually above them;     and there should be plenty of light, coming, however, either     from above or behind, so as not to glare in the horse's eye.
10136-8{_}28512{_}2205.
10136-8{_}28513{_}_Heat_.--The first of these objects is attained, if the     stables are kept within a degree or two of 50° in winter, and     60° in summer; although some grooms insist on a much higher     temperature, in the interests of their own labour.
10136-8{_}28514{_}2206.
10136-8{_}28515{_}_Ventilation_ is usually attained by the insertion of one     or more tubes or boxes of wood or iron through the ceiling and     the roof, with a sloping covering over the opening, to keep out     rain, and valves or ventilators below to regulate the     atmosphere, with openings in the walls for the admission of     fresh air: this is still a difficulty, however; for the     effluvium of the stable is difficult to dispel, and draughts     must be avoided.
10136-8{_}28516{_}This is sometimes accomplished by means of     hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside, for the exit     of bad air, which is carried down through the hollow walls and     discharged at the bottom, while, for the admission of fresh air,     the reverse takes place: the fresh by this means gets diffused     and heated before it is discharged into the stable.
10136-8{_}28517{_}2207.
10136-8{_}28518{_}_The Stalls_ should be divided by partitions of wood-work     eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels, and     nine feet deep, so as to separate each horse from its neighbour.
10136-8{_}28519{_}A hay-rack placed within easy reach of the horse, of wood or     iron, occupies either a corner or the whole breadth of the     stall, which should be about six feet for on ordinary-sized     horse.
10136-8{_}28520{_}A manger, formerly of wood, but of late years more     generally of iron lined with enamel, occupies a corner of the     stall.
10136-8{_}28521{_}The pavement of the stall should be nearly level, with a     slight incline towards the gutter, to keep the bed dry, paved     with hard Dutch brick laid on edge, or asphalte, or smithy     clinkers, or rubble-stones, laid in strong cement.
10136-8{_}28522{_}In the     centre, about five feet from the wall, a grating should be     firmly fixed in the pavement, and in communication with a     well-trapped drain to carry off the water; the gutter outside     the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped     openings.
10136-8{_}28523{_}The passage between the stall and the hall should be     from five to six feet broad at least; on the wall, opposite to     each stall, pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and     other things in daily use.
10136-8{_}28524{_}2208.
10136-8{_}28525{_}_A Harness-room_ is indispensable to every stable.
10136-8{_}28526{_}It     should be dry and airy, and furnished with a fireplace and     boiler, both for the protection of the harness and to prepare     mashes for the horses when required.
10136-8{_}28527{_}The partition-wall should     be boarded where the harness goes, with pegs to hang the various     pieces of harness on, with saddle-trees to rest the saddles on,     a cupboard for the brushes, sponges, and leathers, and a lock-up     corn-bin.
10136-8{_}28528{_}2209.
10136-8{_}28529{_}_The furniture_ of a stable with coachhouse, consists of     coach-mops, jacks for raising the wheels, horse-brushes,     spoke-brushes, water-brushes, crest and bit-brushes,     dandy-brushes, currycombs, birch and heath brooms,     trimming-combs, scissors and pickers, oil-cans and brushes,     harness-brushes of three sorts, leathers, sponges for horse and     carriage, stable-forks, dung-baskets or wheelbarrow, corn-sieves     and measures, horse-cloths and stable pails, horn or glass     lanterns.
10136-8{_}28530{_}Over the stables there should be accommodation for the     coachman or groom to sleep.
10136-8{_}28531{_}Accidents sometimes occur, and he     should be at hand to interfere.
10136-8{_}28532{_}DUTIES OF THE COACHMAN, GROOM, AND STABLE-BOY.
10136-8{_}28533{_}2210.
10136-8{_}28534{_}_The Establishment_ we have in view will consist of coachman, groom, and stable-boy, who are capable of keeping in perfect order four horses, and perhaps the pony.
10136-8{_}28535{_}Of this establishment the coachman is chief.
10136-8{_}28536{_}Besides skill in driving, he should possess a good general knowledge of horses; he has usually to purchase provender, to see that the horses are regularly fed and properly groomed, watch over their condition, apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in the animals under his charge, and report where he observes symptoms of more serious ones which he does not understand.
10136-8{_}28537{_}He has either to clean the carriage himself, or see that the stable-boy does it properly.
10136-8{_}28538{_}2211.
10136-8{_}28539{_}_The Groom's_ first duties are to keep his horses in condition; but he is sometimes expected to perform the duties of a valet, to ride out with his master, on occasions, to wait at table, and otherwise assist in the house: in these cases, he should have the means of dressing himself, and keeping his clothes entirely away from the stables.
10136-8{_}28540{_}In the morning, about six o'clock, or rather before, the stables should be opened and cleaned out, and the horses fed, first by cleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay, putting it lightly in the rack, that the horses may get it out easily; a short time afterwards their usual morning feed of oats should be put into the manger.
10136-8{_}28541{_}While this is going on, the stable-boy has been removing the stable-dung, and sweeping and washing out the stables, both of which should be done every day, and every corner carefully swept, in order to keep the stable sweet and clean.
10136-8{_}28542{_}The real duties of the groom follow: where the horses are not taken out for early exercise, the work of grooming immediately commences.
10136-8{_}28543{_}"Having tied up the head," to use the excellent description of the process given by old Barrett, "take a currycomb and curry him all over the body, to raise the dust, beginning first at the neck, holding the left cheek of the headstall in the left hand, and curry him from the setting-on of his head all over the body to the buttocks, down to the point of the hock; then change your hands, and curry him before, on his breast, and, laying your right arm over his back, join your right side to his left, and curry him all under the belly near the fore-bowels, and so all over from the knees and back upwards; after that, go to the far side and do that likewise.
10136-8{_}28544{_}Then take a dead horse's tail, or, failing that, a cotton dusting-cloth, and strike that away which the currycomb hath raised.
10136-8{_}28545{_}Then take a round brush made of bristles, with a leathern handle, and dress him all over, both head, body, and legs, to the very fetlocks, always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with the currycomb.
10136-8{_}28546{_}In the curry-combing process, as well as brushing, it must be applied with mildness, especially with fine-skinned horses; otherwise the tickling irritates them much.
10136-8{_}28547{_}The brushing is succeeded by a hair-cloth, with which rub him all over again very hard, both to take away loose hairs and lay his coat; then wash your hands in fair water, and rub him all over while they are wet, as well over the head as the body.
10136-8{_}28548{_}Lastly, take a clean cloth, and rub him all over again till he be dry; then take another hair-cloth, and rub all his legs exceeding well from the knees and hocks downwards to his hoofs, picking and dressing them very carefully about the fetlocks, so as to remove all gravel and dust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints."
10136-8{_}28549{_}In addition to the practice of this old writer, modern grooms add wisping, which usually follows brushing.
10136-8{_}28550{_}The best wisp is made from a hayband, untwisted, and again doubled up after being moistened with water: this is applied to every part of the body, as the brushing had been, by changing the hands, taking care in all these operations to carry the hand in the direction of the coat.
10136-8{_}28551{_}Stains on the hair are removed by sponging, or, when the coat is very dirty, by the water-brush; the whole being finished off by a linen or flannel cloth.
10136-8{_}28552{_}The horsecloth should now be put on by taking the cloth in both hands, with the outside next you, and, with your right hand to the off side, throw it over his back, placing it no farther back than will leave it straight and level, which will be about a foot from the tail.
10136-8{_}28553{_}Put the roller round, and the pad-piece under it, about six or eight inches from the fore legs.
10136-8{_}28554{_}The horse's head is now loosened; he is turned about in his stall to have his head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part, including throat, with the dusting-cloth, finishing by "pulling his ears," which all horses seem to enjoy very much.
10136-8{_}28555{_}This done, the mane and foretop should be combed out, passing a wet sponge over them, sponging the mane on both sides, by throwing it back to the midriff, to make it lie smooth.
10136-8{_}28556{_}The horse is now returned to his headstall, his tail combed out, cleaning it of stains with a wet brush or sponge, trimming both tail and mane, and forelock when necessary, smoothing them down with a brush on which a little oil has been dropped.
10136-8{_}28557{_}2212.
10136-8{_}28558{_}Watering usually follows dressing; but some horses refuse     their food until they have drunk: the groom should not,     therefore, lay down exclusive rules on this subject, but study     the temper and habits of his horse.
10136-8{_}28559{_}2213.
10136-8{_}28560{_}_Exercise_.--All horses not in work require at least two     hours' exercise daily; and in exercising them a good groom will     put them through the paces to which they have been trained.
10136-8{_}28561{_}In     the case of saddle-horses he will walk, trot, canter, and gallop     them, in order to keep them up to their work.
10136-8{_}28562{_}With draught     horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot.
10136-8{_}28563{_}2214.
10136-8{_}28564{_}_Feeding_ must depend on their work, but they require     feeding three times a day, with more or less corn each time,     according to their work.
10136-8{_}28565{_}In the fast coaching days it was a     saying among proprietors, that "his belly was the measure of his     food;" but the horse's appetite is not to be taken as a     criterion of the quantity of food under any circumstances.
10136-8{_}28566{_}Horses have been known to consume 40 lbs.
10136-8{_}28567{_}of hay in twenty-four     hours, whereas 16 lbs.
10136-8{_}28568{_}to 18 lbs.
10136-8{_}28569{_}is the utmost which should     have been given.
10136-8{_}28570{_}Mr. Croall, an extensive coach proprietor in     Scotland, limited his horses to 4-1/2 lbs.
10136-8{_}28571{_}cut straw, 8 lbs.
10136-8{_}28572{_}bruised oats, and 2-1/2 lbs.
10136-8{_}28573{_}bruised beans, in the morning and     noon, giving them at night 25 lbs.
10136-8{_}28574{_}of the following; viz., 560     lbs.
10136-8{_}28575{_}steamed potatoes, 36 lbs.
10136-8{_}28576{_}barley-dust, 40 lbs.
10136-8{_}28577{_}cut straw,     and 6 lbs.
10136-8{_}28578{_}salt, mixed up together: under this the horses did     their work well.
10136-8{_}28579{_}The ordinary measure given a horse is a peck of     oats, about 40 lbs.
10136-8{_}28580{_}to the bushel, twice a day, a third feed and     a rack-full of hay, which may be about 15 lbs.
10136-8{_}28581{_}or 18 lbs., when     he is in full work.
10136-8{_}28582{_}2215.
10136-8{_}28583{_}You cannot take up a paper without having the question     put, "Do you bruise your oats?"
10136-8{_}28584{_}Well, that depends on     circumstances: a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when     it can get them; but aged horses, after a time, lose the power     of masticating and bruising them, and bolt them whole; thus much     impeding the work of digestion.
10136-8{_}28585{_}For an old horse, then, bruise     the oats; for a young one it does no harm and little good.
10136-8{_}28586{_}Oats     should be bright and dry, and not too new.
10136-8{_}28587{_}Where they are new,     sprinkle them with salt and water; otherwise, they overload the     horse's stomach.
10136-8{_}28588{_}Chopped straw mixed with oats, in the     proportion of a third of straw or hay, is a good food for horses     in full work; and carrots, of which horses are remarkably fond,     have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the     coat.
10136-8{_}28589{_}2216.
10136-8{_}28590{_}The water given to a horse merits some attention; it     should not be too cold; hard water is not to be recommended;     stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious; river water is     the best for all purposes; and anything is preferable to spring     water, which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour     or two, and stirred up before using it; a handful of oatmeal     thrown into the pail will much improve its quality.
10136-8{_}28591{_}2217.
10136-8{_}28592{_}_Shoeing_.--A horse should not be sent on a journey or any     other hard work immediately after new shoeing;--the stiffness     incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down.
10136-8{_}28593{_}A     day's rest, with reasonable exercise, will not be thrown away     after this operation.
10136-8{_}28594{_}On reaching home very hot, the groom     should walk him about for a few minutes; this done, he should     take off the moisture with the scraper, and afterwards wisp him     over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth: if the cloth     is dipped in some spirit, all the better.
10136-8{_}28595{_}He should wash, pick,     and wipe dry the legs and feet, take off the bridle and crupper,     and fasten it to the rack, then the girths, and put a wisp of     straw under the saddle.
10136-8{_}28596{_}When sufficiently cool, the horse should     have some hay given him, and then a feed of oats: if he refuse     the latter, offer him a little wet bran, or a handful of oatmeal     in tepid water.
10136-8{_}28597{_}When he has been fed, he should be thoroughly     cleaned, and his body-clothes put on, and, if very much harassed     with fatigue, a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on     a valuable horse, adding plenty of fresh litter under the belly.
10136-8{_}28598{_}2218.
10136-8{_}28599{_}_Bridles_.--Every time a horse is unbridled, the bit     should be carefully washed and dried, and the leather wiped, to     keep them sweet, as well as the girths and saddle, the latter     being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is     again put on.
10136-8{_}28600{_}In washing a horse's feet after a day's work, the     master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed     thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them, and     then rubbed with a brush till quite dry.
10136-8{_}28601{_}2219.
10136-8{_}28602{_}_Harness_, if not carefully preserved, very soon gets a     shabby tarnished appearance.
10136-8{_}28603{_}Where the coachman has a proper     harness-room and sufficient assistance, this is inexcusable and     easily prevented.
10136-8{_}28604{_}The harness-room should have a wooden lining     all round, and be perfectly dry and well ventilated.
10136-8{_}28605{_}Around the     walls, hooks and pegs should be placed, for the several pieces     of harness, at such a height as to prevent their touching the     ground; and every part of the harness should have its peg or     hook,--one for the halters, another for the reins, and others     for snaffles and other bits and metal-work; and either a wooden     horse or saddle-trees for the saddles and pads.
10136-8{_}28606{_}All these parts     should be dry, clean, and shining.
10136-8{_}28607{_}This is only to be done by     careful cleaning and polishing, and the use of several requisite     pastes.
10136-8{_}28608{_}The metallic parts, when white, should be cleaned by a     soft brush and plate-powder; the copper and brass parts     burnished with rottenstone-powder and oil,--steel with     emery-powder; both made into a paste with a little oil.
10136-8{_}28609{_}2220.
10136-8{_}28610{_}An excellent paste for polishing harness and the     leather-work of carriages, is made by melting 8 lbs.
10136-8{_}28611{_}of yellow     wax, stirring it till completely dissolved.
10136-8{_}28612{_}Into this pour 1 lb.
10136-8{_}28613{_}of litharge of the shops, which has been pounded up with water,     and dried and sifted through a sieve, leaving the two, when     mixed, to simmer on the fire, stirring them continually till all     is melted.
10136-8{_}28614{_}When it is a little cool, mix this with 1-1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}28615{_}of     good ivory-black; place this again on the fire, and stir till it     boils anew, and suffer it to cool.
10136-8{_}28616{_}When cooled a little, add     distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thickish     paste, scenting it with any essence at hand, thinning it when     necessary from time to time, by adding distilled turpentine.
10136-8{_}28617{_}2221.
10136-8{_}28618{_}When the leather is old and greasy, it should be cleaned     before applying this polish, with a brush wetted in a weak     solution of potass and water, washing afterwards with soft river     water, and drying thoroughly.
10136-8{_}28619{_}If the leather is not black, one     or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the     polish.
10136-8{_}28620{_}When quite dry, the varnish should be laid on with a     soft shoe-brush, using also a soft brush to polish the leather.
10136-8{_}28621{_}2222.
10136-8{_}28622{_}When the leather is very old, it may be softened with     fish-oil, and, after putting on the ink, a sponge charged with     distilled turpentine passed over, to scour the surface of the     leather, which should be polished as above.
10136-8{_}28623{_}2223.
10136-8{_}28624{_}_For fawn or yellow-coloured leather_, take a quart of     skimmed milk, pour into it 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28625{_}of sulphuric acid, and, when     cold, add to it 4 oz.
10136-8{_}28626{_}of hydrochloric acid, shaking the bottle     gently until it ceases to emit white vapours; separate the     coagulated from the liquid part, by straining through a sieve,     and store it away till required.
10136-8{_}28627{_}In applying it, clean the     leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid, washing it off     immediately, and apply the composition when dry with a sponge.
10136-8{_}28628{_}2224.
10136-8{_}28629{_}_Wheel-grease_ is usually purchased at the shops; but a     good paste is made as follows:--Melt 80 parts of grease, and     stir into it, mixing it thoroughly and smoothly, 20 parts of     fine black-lead in powder, and store away in a tin box for use.
10136-8{_}28630{_}This grease is used in the mint at Paris, and is highly     approved.
10136-8{_}28631{_}2225.
10136-8{_}28632{_}_Carriages_ in an endless variety of shapes and names are     continually making their appearance; but the hackney cab or     clarence seems most in request for light carriages; the family     carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence     adapted for family use.
10136-8{_}28633{_}The carriage is a valuable piece of     furniture, requiring all the care of the most delicate     upholstery, with the additional disadvantage of continual     exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets.
10136-8{_}28634{_}2216.
10136-8{_}28635{_}It requires, therefore, to be carefully cleaned before putting away, and a coach-house perfectly dry and well ventilated, for the wood-work swells with moisture; it shrinks also with heat, unless the timber has undergone a long course of seasoning: it should also have a dry floor, a boarded one being recommended.
10136-8{_}28636{_}It must be removed from the ammoniacal influence of the stables, from open drains and cesspools, and other gaseous influences likely to affect the paint and varnish.
10136-8{_}28637{_}When the carriage returns home, it should be carefully washed and dried, and that, if possible, before the mud has time to dry on it.
10136-8{_}28638{_}This is done by first well slushing it with clean water, so as to wash away all particles of sand, having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the linings.
10136-8{_}28639{_}The body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop, using plenty of clean water, and penetrating into every corner of the carved work, so that not an atom of dirt remains; the body of the carriage is then raised by placing the jack under the axletree and raising it so that the wheel turns freely; this is now thoroughly washed with the mop until the dirt is removed, using a water-brush for corners where the mop does not penetrate.
10136-8{_}28640{_}Every particle of mud and sand removed by the mop, and afterwards with a wet sponge, the carriage is wiped dry, and, as soon after as possible, the varnish is carefully polished with soft leather, using a little sweet oil for the leather parts, and even for the panels, so as to check any tendency of the varnish to crack.
10136-8{_}28641{_}Stains are removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet oil; if that fails, a little Tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more successful.
10136-8{_}28642{_}2227.
10136-8{_}28643{_}In preparing the carriage for use, the whole body should be rubbed over with a clean leather and carefully polished, the iron-work and joints oiled, the plated and brass-work occasionally cleaned,--the one with plate-powder, or with well-washed whiting mixed with sweet oil, and leather kept for the purpose,--the other with rottenstone mixed with a little oil, and applied without too much rubbing, until the paste is removed; but, if rubbed every day with the leather, little more will be required to keep it untarnished.
10136-8{_}28644{_}The linings require careful brushing every day, the cushions being taken out and beaten, and the glass sashes should always be bright and clean.
10136-8{_}28645{_}The wheel-tires and axletree are carefully seen to, and greased when required, the bolts and nuts tightened, and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled.
10136-8{_}28646{_}2228.
10136-8{_}28647{_}These duties, however, are only incidental to the coachman's office, which is to drive; and much of the enjoyment of those in the carriage depends on his proficiency in his art,--much also of the wear of the carriage and horses.
10136-8{_}28648{_}He should have sufficient knowledge of the construction of the carriage to know when it is out of order,--to know, also, the pace at which he can go over the road he has under him, without risking the springs, and without shaking those he is driving too much.
10136-8{_}28649{_}2229.
10136-8{_}28650{_}Having, with or without the help of the groom or stable-boy, put his horses to the carriage, and satisfied himself, by walking round them, that everything is properly arranged, the coachman proceeds to the off-side of the carriage, takes the reins from the back of the horses, where they were thrown, buckles them together, and, placing his foot on the step, ascends to his box, having his horses now entirely under control.
10136-8{_}28651{_}In ordinary circumstances, he is not expected to descend, for where no footman accompanies the carriage, the doors are usually so arranged that even a lady may let herself out, if she wishes it, from the inside.
10136-8{_}28652{_}The coachman's duties are to avoid everything approaching an accident, and all his attention is required to guide his horses.
10136-8{_}28653{_}2230.
10136-8{_}28654{_}The pace at which he drives will depend upon his     orders,--in all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight     miles an hour; less speed is injurious to the horses, getting     them into lazy and sluggish habits; for it is wonderful how soon     these are acquired by some horses.
10136-8{_}28655{_}The writer was once employed     to purchase a horse for a country friend, and he picked a very     handsome gelding out of Collins's stables, which seemed to     answer to his friend's wants.
10136-8{_}28656{_}It was duly committed to the     coachman who was to drive it, after some very successful trials     in harness and out of it, and seemed likely to give great     satisfaction.
10136-8{_}28657{_}After a time, the friend got tired of his     carriage, and gave it up; as the easiest mode of getting rid of     the horse, it was sent up to the writer's stables,--a present.
10136-8{_}28658{_}Only twelve months had elapsed; the horse was as handsome as     ever, with plenty of flesh, and a sleek glossy coat, and he was     thankfully enough received; but, on trial, it was found that a     stupid coachman, who was imbued with one of their old maxims,     that "it's the pace that kills," had driven the horse, capable     of doing his nine miles an hour with ease, at a jog-trot of four     miles, or four and a half; and now, no persuasion of the whip     could get more out of him.
10136-8{_}28659{_}After many unsuccessful efforts to     bring him back to his pace, in one of which a break-down     occurred, under the hands of a professional trainer, he was sent     to the hammer, and sold for a sum that did not pay for the     attempt to break him in.
10136-8{_}28660{_}This maxim, therefore, "that it's the     pace that kills," is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense     in which we are viewing it.
10136-8{_}28661{_}In the old coaching days, indeed,     when the Shrewsbury "Wonder" drove into the inn yard while the     clock was striking, week after week and mouth after month, with     unerring regularity, twenty-seven hours to a hundred and     sixty-two miles; when the "Quicksilver" mail was timed to eleven     miles an hour between London and Plymouth, with a fine of £5 to     the driver if behind time; when the Brighton "Age," "tool'd" and     horsed by the late Mr. Stevenson, used to dash round the square     as the fifth hour was striking, having stopped at the half-way     house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry     to his passengers,--then the pace was indeed "killing."
10136-8{_}28662{_}But the     truth is, horses that are driven at a jog-trot pace lose that     _élan_ with which a good driver can inspire them, and they are     left to do their work by mere weight and muscle; therefore,     unless he has contrary orders, a good driver will choose a smart     pace, but not enough to make his horses perspire: on level roads     this should never be seen.
10136-8{_}28663{_}2231.
10136-8{_}28664{_}In choosing his horses, every master will see that they     are properly paired,--that their paces are about equal.
10136-8{_}28665{_}When     their habits differ, it is the coachman's duty to discover how     he can, with least annoyance to the horses, get that pace out of     them.
10136-8{_}28666{_}Some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the     check, and the curb irritates them; others, with harder mouths,     cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords; he     must, therefore, accommodate the horses as he best can.
10136-8{_}28667{_}The     reins should always be held so that the horses are "in hand;"     but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein;     the pain to the horse is intolerable, and causes him to rear and     plunge, and finally break sway, if he can.
10136-8{_}28668{_}He is also a bad     driver when the reins are always slack; the horse then feels     abandoned to himself; he is neither directed nor supported, and     if no accident occurs, it is great good luck.
10136-8{_}28669{_}2232.
10136-8{_}28670{_}The true coachman's hands are so delicate and gentle, that the mere weight of the reins is felt on the bit, and the directions are indicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by a pull; the horses are guided and encouraged, and only pulled up when they exceed their intended pace, or in the event of a stumble; for there is a strong though gentle hand on the reins.
10136-8{_}28671{_}2233.
10136-8{_}28672{_}_The Whip_, in the hands of a good driver, and with well-bred cattle, is there, more as a precaution than a "tool" for frequent use; if he uses it, it is to encourage, by stroking the flanks; except, indeed, he has to punish some waywardness of temper, and then he does it effectually, taking care, however, that it is done on the flank, where there is no very tender part, never on the crupper.
10136-8{_}28673{_}In driving, the coachman should never give way to temper.
10136-8{_}28674{_}How often do we see horses stumble from being conducted, or at least "allowed," to go over bad ground by some careless driver, who immediately wreaks that vengeance on the poor horse which might, with much more justice, be applied to his own brutal shoulders.
10136-8{_}28675{_}The whip is of course useful, and even necessary, but should be rarely used, except to encourage and excite the horses.
10136-8{_}28676{_}DUTIES OF THE VALET.
10136-8{_}28677{_}2234.
10136-8{_}28678{_}_Attendants on the Person_.-"No man is a hero to his valet," saith the proverb; and the corollary may run, "No lady is a heroine to her maid."
10136-8{_}28679{_}The infirmities of humanity are, perhaps, too numerous and too equally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which attendants on the person have opportunities of applying.
10136-8{_}28680{_}The valet and waiting-maid are placed near the persons of the master and mistress, receiving orders only from them, dressing them, accompanying them in all their journeys, the confidants and agents of their most unguarded moments, of their most secret habits, and of course subject to their commands,--even to their caprices; they themselves being subject to erring judgment, aggravated by an imperfect education.
10136-8{_}28681{_}All that can be expected from such servants is polite manners, modest demeanour, and a respectful reserve, which are indispensable.
10136-8{_}28682{_}To these, good sense, good temper, some self-denial, and consideration for the feelings of others, whether above or below them in the social scale, will be useful qualifications.
10136-8{_}28683{_}Their duty leads them to wait on those who are, from sheer wealth, station, and education, more polished, and consequently more susceptible of annoyance; and any vulgar familiarity of manner is opposed to all their notions of self-respect.
10136-8{_}28684{_}Quiet unobtrusive manners, therefore, and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers, either in praise or blame, is as essential in their absence, as good manners and respectful conduct in their presence.
10136-8{_}28685{_}2235.
10136-8{_}28686{_}Some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating of the duties of the footman in a small family.
10136-8{_}28687{_}His day commences by seeing that his master's dressing-room is in order; that the housemaid has swept and dusted it properly; that the fire is lighted and burns cheerfully; and some time before his master is expected, he will do well to throw up the sash to admit fresh air, closing it, however, in time to recover the temperature which he knows his master prefers.
10136-8{_}28688{_}It is now his duty to place the body-linen on the horse before the fire, to be aired properly; to lay the trousers intended to be worn, carefully brushed and cleaned, on the back of his master's chair; while the coat and waistcoat, carefully brushed and folded, and the collar cleaned, are laid in their place ready to put on when required.
10136-8{_}28689{_}All the articles of the toilet should be in their places, the razors properly set and stropped, and hot water ready for use.
10136-8{_}28690{_}2236.
10136-8{_}28691{_}Gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving themselves, but a valet should be prepared to do it if required; and he should, besides, be a good hairdresser.
10136-8{_}28692{_}Shaving over, he has to brush the hair, beard, and moustache, where that appendage is encouraged, arranging the whole simply and gracefully, according to the age and style of countenance.
10136-8{_}28693{_}Every fortnight, or three weeks at the utmost, the hair should be cut, and the points of the whiskers trimmed as often as required.
10136-8{_}28694{_}A good valet will now present the various articles of the toilet as they are wanted; afterwards, the body-linen, neck-tie, which he will put on, if required, and, afterwards, waistcoat, coat, and boots, in suitable order, and carefully brushed and polished.
10136-8{_}28695{_}2237.
10136-8{_}28696{_}Having thus seen his master dressed, if he is about to go out, the valet will hand him his cane, gloves, and hat, the latter well brushed on the outside with a soft brush, and wiped inside with a clean handkerchief, respectfully attend him to the door, and open it for him, and receive his last orders for the day.
10136-8{_}28697{_}2238.
10136-8{_}28698{_}He now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressing-room, cleans the combs and brushes, and brushes and folds up any clothes that may be left about the room, and puts them away in the drawers.
10136-8{_}28699{_}2239.
10136-8{_}28700{_}Gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and appearance; it is the valet's duty, in this case, where his master permits it, to select from the wardrobe such things as are suitable for the occasion, so that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and cleanliness; that his linen and neck-tie, where that is white or coloured, are unsoiled; and where he is not accustomed to change them every day, that the cravat is turned, and even ironed, to remove the crease of the previous fold.
10136-8{_}28701{_}The coat collar,--which where the hair is oily and worn long, is apt to get greasy--should also be examined; a careful valet will correct this by removing the spots day by day as they appear, first by moistening the grease-spots with a little rectified spirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn, which has a renovating effect, and the smell of which soon disappears.
10136-8{_}28702{_}The grease is dissolved and removed by gentle scraping.
10136-8{_}28703{_}The grease removed, add a little more of the spirit, and rub with a piece of clean cloth; finish by adding a few drops more; rub it with the palm of the hand, in the direction of the grain of the cloth, and it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the garment.
10136-8{_}28704{_}2240.
10136-8{_}28705{_}Polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet,     and not always to be obtained good by purchase; never so good,     perhaps, as he can make for himself after the following     recipes:--Take of ivory-black and treacle each 4 oz., sulphuric     acid 1 oz., best olive-oil 2 spoonfuls, best white-wine vinegar     3 half-pints: mix the ivory-black and treacle well in an earthen     jar; then add the sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the     mixture; next pour in the oil; and, lastly, add the vinegar,     stirring it in by degrees, until thoroughly incorporated.
10136-8{_}28706{_}241.
10136-8{_}28707{_}Another polish is made by mixing 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28708{_}each of pounded     galls and logwood-chips, and 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}28709{_}of red French vine     (ordinaire).
10136-8{_}28710{_}Boil together till the liquid is reduced to half     the quantity, and pour it off through a strainer.
10136-8{_}28711{_}Now take 1/2     lb.
10136-8{_}28712{_}each of pounded gum-arabic and lump-sugar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28713{_}of green     copperas, and 3 lbs.
10136-8{_}28714{_}of brandy.
10136-8{_}28715{_}Dissolve the gum-arabic in the     preceding decoction, and add the sugar and copperas: when all is     dissolved and mixed together, stir in the brandy, mixing it     smoothly.
10136-8{_}28716{_}This mixture will yield 5 or 6 lbs.
10136-8{_}28717{_}of a very superior     polishing paste for boots and shoes.
10136-8{_}28718{_}2242.
10136-8{_}28719{_}It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that having discharged all the commissions intrusted to him by his master, such as conveying notes or messages to friends, or the tradesmen, all of which he should punctually and promptly attend to, it is his duty to be in waiting when his master returns home to dress for dinner, or for any other occasion, and to have all things prepared for this second dressing.
10136-8{_}28720{_}Previous to this, he brings under his notice the cards of visitors who may have called, delivers the messages be may have received for him, and otherwise acquits himself of the morning's commissions, and receives his orders for the remainder of the day.
10136-8{_}28721{_}The routine of his evening duty is to have the dressing-room and study, where there is a separate one, arranged comfortably for his master, the fires lighted, candles prepared, dressing-gown and slippers in their place, and aired, and everything in order that is required for his master's comforts.
10136-8{_}28722{_}FEMALE DOMESTICS.
10136-8{_}28723{_}DUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID.
10136-8{_}28724{_}2243.
10136-8{_}28725{_}The duties of a lady's-maid are more numerous, and perhaps more onerous, than those of the valet; for while the latter is aided by the tailor, the hatter, the linen-draper, and the perfumer, the lady's-maid has to originate many parts of the mistress's dress herself: she should, indeed, be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker, a good hairdresser, and possess some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with which the toilet-table is supplied, in order to use them with safety and effect.
10136-8{_}28726{_}Her first duty in the morning, after having performed her own toilet, is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening before, either to put them away, or to see that they are all in order to put on again.
10136-8{_}28727{_}During the winter, and in wet weather, the dresses should be carefully examined, and the mud removed.
10136-8{_}28728{_}Dresses of tweed, and other woollen materials, may be laid out on a table and brushed all over; but in general, even in woollen fabrics, the lightness of the tissues renders brushing unsuitable to dresses, and it is better to remove the dust from the folds by beating them lightly with a handkerchief or thin cloth.
10136-8{_}28729{_}Silk dresses should never be brushed, but rubbed with a piece of merino, or other soft material, of a similar colour, kept for the purpose.
10136-8{_}28730{_}Summer dresses of barège, muslin, mohair, and other light materials, simply require shaking; but if the muslin be tumbled, it must be ironed afterwards.
10136-8{_}28731{_}If the dresses require slight repair, it should be done at once: "a stitch in time saves nine."
10136-8{_}28732{_}2244.
10136-8{_}28733{_}The bonnet should be dusted with a light feather plume, in     order to remove every particle of dust; but this has probably     been done, as it ought to have been, the night before.
10136-8{_}28734{_}Velvet     bonnets, and other velvet articles of dress, should be cleaned     with a soft brush.
10136-8{_}28735{_}If the flowers with which the bonnet is     decorated have been crushed or displaced, or the leaves tumbled,     they should be raised and readjusted by means of flower-pliers.
10136-8{_}28736{_}If feathers have suffered from damp, they should be held near     the fire for a few minutes, and restored to their natural state     by the hand or a soft brush.
10136-8{_}28737{_}2245.
10136-8{_}28738{_}_The Chausserie_, or foot-gear of a lady, is one of the     few things left to mark her station, and requires special care.
10136-8{_}28739{_}Satin boots or shoes should be dusted with a soft brush, or     wiped with a cloth.
10136-8{_}28740{_}Kid or varnished leather should have the mud     wiped off with a sponge charged with milk, which preserves its     softness and polish.
10136-8{_}28741{_}The following is also an excellent polish     for applying to ladies' boots, instead of blacking them:--Mix     equal proportions of sweet-oil, vinegar, and treacle, with 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28742{_}of lamp-black.
10136-8{_}28743{_}When all the ingredients are thoroughly     incorporated, rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of the     hand, and put them in a cool place to dry.
10136-8{_}28744{_}Ladies' blacking,     which may be purchased in 6d, and 1s.
10136-8{_}28745{_}bottles, is also very much     used for patent leather and kid boots, particularly when they     are a little worn.
10136-8{_}28746{_}This blacking is merely applied with a piece     of sponge, and the boots should not be put on until the blacking     is dry und hardened.
10136-8{_}28747{_}2246.
10136-8{_}28748{_}These various preliminary offices performed, the lady's-maid should prepare for dressing her mistress, arranging her dressing-room, toilet-table, and linen, according to her mistress's wishes and habits.
10136-8{_}28749{_}The details of dressing we need not touch upon,--every lady has her own mode of doing so; but the maid should move about quietly, perform any offices about her mistress's person, as lacing stays, gently, and adjust her linen smoothly.
10136-8{_}28750{_}2247.
10136-8{_}28751{_}Having prepared the dressing-room by lighting the fire, sweeping the hearth, and made everything ready for dressing her mistress, placed her linen before the fire to air, and laid out the various articles of dress she is to wear, which will probably have been arranged the previous evening, the lady's-maid is prepared for the morning's duties.
10136-8{_}28752{_}2248.
10136-8{_}28753{_}_Hairdressing_ is the most important part of the lady's-maid's office.
10136-8{_}28754{_}If ringlets are worn, remove the curl-papers, and, after thoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below, dress it according to the prevailing fashion.
10136-8{_}28755{_}If bandeaux are worn, the hair is thoroughly brushed and frizzed outside and inside, folding the hair back round the head, brushing it perfectly smooth, giving it a glossy appearance by the use of pomades, or oil, applied by the palm of the hand, smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline.
10136-8{_}28756{_}Double bandeaux are formed by bringing most of the hair forward, and rolling it over frizettes made of hair the same colour as that of the wearer: it is finished behind by plaiting the hair, and arranging it in such a manner as to look well with the head-dress.
10136-8{_}28757{_}2249.
10136-8{_}28758{_}Lessons in hairdressing may be obtained, and at not an unreasonable charge.
10136-8{_}28759{_}If a lady's-maid can afford it, we would advise her to initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before entering on her duties.
10136-8{_}28760{_}If a mistress finds her maid handy, and willing to learn, she will not mind the expense of a few lessons, which are almost necessary, as the fashion and mode of dressing the hair is so continually changing.
10136-8{_}28761{_}Brushes and combs should be kept scrupulously clean, by washing them about twice a week: to do this oftener spoils the brushes, as very frequent washing makes them so very soft.
10136-8{_}28762{_}To wash Brushes.
10136-8{_}28763{_}2250.
10136-8{_}28764{_}Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water, allowing a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water.
10136-8{_}28765{_}Put the water into a basin, and, after combing out the hair from the brushes, dip them, bristles downwards, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles as free from the water as possible.
10136-8{_}28766{_}Repeat this until the bristles look clean; then rinse the brushes in a little cold water; shake them well, and wipe the handles and backs with a towel, _but not the bristles_, and set the brushes to dry in the sun, or near the fire; but take care not to put them too close to it.
10136-8{_}28767{_}Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft, as does also the use of soap.
10136-8{_}28768{_}To clean Combs.
10136-8{_}28769{_}2251.
10136-8{_}28770{_}If it can be avoided, never wash combs, as the water often makes the teeth split, and the tortoiseshell or horn of which they are made, rough.
10136-8{_}28771{_}Small brushes, manufactured purposely for cleaning combs, may be purchased at a trifling cost: with this the comb should be well brushed, and afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel.
10136-8{_}28772{_}A good Wash for the Hair.
10136-8{_}28773{_}2252.
10136-8{_}28774{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 pennyworth of borax, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1 pint of boiling water.
10136-8{_}28775{_}_Mode_.--Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; let it cool; then put the mixture into a bottle.
10136-8{_}28776{_}Shake it before using, and apply it with a flannel.
10136-8{_}28777{_}Camphor and borax, dissolved in boiling water and left to cool, make a very good wash for the hair; as also does rosemary-water mixed with a little borax.
10136-8{_}28778{_}After using any of these washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed in, to make it smooth and glossy.
10136-8{_}28779{_}To make Pomade for the Hair.
10136-8{_}28780{_}2253.
10136-8{_}28781{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}28782{_}of lard, 2 pennyworth of castor-oil; scent.
10136-8{_}28783{_}_Mode_.--Let the lard be unsalted; beat it up well; then add the castor-oil, and mix thoroughly together with a knife, adding a few drops of any scent that may be preferred.
10136-8{_}28784{_}Put the pomatum into pots, which keep well covered to prevent it turning rancid.
10136-8{_}28785{_}Another Recipe for Pomatum.
10136-8{_}28786{_}2254.
10136-8{_}28787{_}INGREDIENTS.--8 oz.
10136-8{_}28788{_}of olive-oil, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28789{_}of spermaceti, 3 pennyworth of essential oil of almonds, 3 pennyworth of essence of lemon.
10136-8{_}28790{_}_Mode_.--Mix these ingredients together, and store away in jars for use.
10136-8{_}28791{_}To make Bandoline.
10136-8{_}28792{_}2555.
10136-8{_}28793{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 oz.
10136-8{_}28794{_}of gum-tragacanth, 1/4 pint of cold water, 3 pennyworth of essence of almonds, 2 teaspoonfuls of old rum.
10136-8{_}28795{_}_Mode_.--Put the gum-tragacanth into a wide-mouthed bottle with the cold water; let it stand till dissolved, then stir into it the essence of almonds; let it remain for an hour or two, when pour the rum on the top.
10136-8{_}28796{_}This should make the stock bottle, and when any is required for use, it is merely necessary to dilute it with a little cold water until the desired consistency is obtained, and to keep it in a small bottle, well corked, for use.
10136-8{_}28797{_}This bandoline, instead of injuring the hair, as many other kinds often do, improves it, by increasing its growth, and making it always smooth and glossy.
10136-8{_}28798{_}An excellent Pomatum.
10136-8{_}28799{_}2256.
10136-8{_}28800{_}INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}28801{_}of lard, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1/2 pint of castor-oil, 4 oz.
10136-8{_}28802{_}of spermaceti, bergamot, or any other scent; elder-flower water.
10136-8{_}28803{_}_Mode_.--Wash the lard well in the elder-flower water; drain, and beat it to a cream.
10136-8{_}28804{_}Mix the two oils together, and heat them sufficiently to dissolve the spermaceti, which should be beaten fine in a mortar.
10136-8{_}28805{_}Mix all these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of scent may be preferred; and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use, keeping them well corked.
10136-8{_}28806{_}The best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set the bottle in a saucepan of warm water.
10136-8{_}28807{_}It will remain good for many months.
10136-8{_}28808{_}To promote the Growth of Hair.
10136-8{_}28809{_}2257.
10136-8{_}28810{_}INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of olive-oil and spirit of rosemary; a few drops of oil of nutmeg.
10136-8{_}28811{_}_Mode_.--Mix the ingredients together, rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of this liniment, and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase.
10136-8{_}28812{_}2258.
10136-8{_}28813{_}Our further remarks on dressing must be confined to some     general advice.
10136-8{_}28814{_}In putting on a band, see that it is laid quite     flat, and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned     in front; that the pin is a strong one, and that it is secured     to the stays, so as not to slip up or down, or crease in the     folds.
10136-8{_}28815{_}Arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline     petticoats; if the dress fastens behind, put a small pin in the     slit to prevent it from opening.
10136-8{_}28816{_}See that the sleeves fall well     over the arms.
10136-8{_}28817{_}If it is finished with a jacket, or other upper     dress, see that it fits smoothly under the arms; pull out the     flounces, and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the     hands, so that it falls in graceful folds.
10136-8{_}28818{_}In arranging the     petticoat itself, a careful lady's-maid will see that this is     firmly fastened round the waist.
10136-8{_}28819{_}2259.
10136-8{_}28820{_}Where sashes are worn, pin the bows securely on the inside     with a pin, so as not to be visible; then raise the bow with the     fingers.
10136-8{_}28821{_}The collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with     brooch or bow in the centre.
10136-8{_}28822{_}2260.
10136-8{_}28823{_}Having dressed her mistress for breakfast, and breakfasted herself, the further duties of the lady's-maid will depend altogether upon the habits of the family, in which hardly two will probably agree.
10136-8{_}28824{_}Where the duties are entirely confined to attendance on her mistress, it is probable that the bedroom and dressing-room will be committed to her care; that, the housemaid will rarely enter, except for the weekly or other periodical cleaning; she will, therefore, have to make her mistress's bed, and keep it in order; and as her duties are light and easy, there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to uncleanliness or want of order.
10136-8{_}28825{_}Every morning, immediately after her mistress has left it, and while breakfast is on, she should throw the bed open, by taking off the clothes; open the windows (except in rainy weather), and leave the room to air for half an hour.
10136-8{_}28826{_}After breakfast, except her attendance on her mistress prevents it, if the rooms are carpeted, she should sweep them carefully, having previously strewed the room with moist tea-leaves, dusting every table and chair, taking care to penetrate to every corner, and moving every article of furniture that is portable.
10136-8{_}28827{_}This done satisfactorily, and having cleaned the dressing-glass, polished up the furniture and the ornaments, and made the glass jug and basin clean and bright, emptied all slops, emptied the water-jugs and filled them with fresh water, and arranged the rooms, the dressing-room is ready for the mistress when she thinks proper to appear.
10136-8{_}28828{_}2261.
10136-8{_}28829{_}The dressing-room thoroughly in order, the same thing is to be done in the bedroom, in which she will probably be assisted by the housemaid to make the bed and empty the slops.
10136-8{_}28830{_}In making the bed, she will study her lady's wishes, whether it is to be hard or soft, sloping or straight, and see that it is done accordingly.
10136-8{_}28831{_}2262.
10136-8{_}28832{_}Having swept the bedroom with equal care, dusted the tables and chairs, chimney-ornaments, and put away all articles of dress left from yesterday, and cleaned and put away any articles of jewellery, her next care is to see, before her mistress goes out, what requires replacing in her department, and furnish her with a list of them, that she may use her discretion about ordering them.
10136-8{_}28833{_}All this done, she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged.
10136-8{_}28834{_}This will consist chiefly in mending; which is first to be seen to; everything, except stockings, being mended before washing.
10136-8{_}28835{_}Plain work will probably be one of the lady's-maid's chief employments.
10136-8{_}28836{_}2263.
10136-8{_}28837{_}A waiting-maid, who wishes to make herself useful, will     study the fashion-books with attention, so as to be able to aid     her mistress's judgment in dressing, according to the prevailing     fashion, with such modifications as her style of countenance     requires.
10136-8{_}28838{_}She will also, if she has her mistress's interest at     heart, employ her spare time in repairing and making up dresses     which have served one purpose, to serve another also, or turning     many things, unfitted for her mistress to use, for the younger     branches of the family.
10136-8{_}28839{_}The lady's-maid may thus render herself     invaluable to her mistress, and increase her own happiness in so     doing.
10136-8{_}28840{_}The exigencies of fashion and luxury are such, that all     ladies, except those of the very highest rank, will consider     themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person,     capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose.
10136-8{_}28841{_}2264.
10136-8{_}28842{_}Among other duties, the lady's-maid should understand the various processes for washing, and cleaning, and repairing laces; edging of collars; removing stains and grease-spots from dresses, and similar processes, for which the following recipes will be found very useful.
10136-8{_}28843{_}In washing--      2265.
10136-8{_}28844{_}_Blonde_, fine toilet-soap is used; the blonde is soaped     over very slightly, and washed in water in which a little     fig-blue is dissolved, rubbing it very gently; when clean, dry     it.
10136-8{_}28845{_}Dip it afterwards in very thin gum-water, dry it again in     linen, spread it out as flat as it will lie, and iron it.
10136-8{_}28846{_}Where     the blonde is of better quality, and wider, it may be stretched     on a hoop to dry after washing in the blue-water, applying the     gum with a sponge; or it may be washed finally in water in which     a lump of sugar has been dissolved, which gives it more the     appearance of new blonde.
10136-8{_}28847{_}2266.
10136-8{_}28848{_}Lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the     neck; they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between     the folds of a fine linen cloth, then washing the edges as     directed above, and spreading it out on an ironing-board,     pinning it at each corner with fine pins; then going carefully     over it with a sponge charged with water in which some     gum-dragon and fig-blue have been dissolved, to give it a proper     consistence.
10136-8{_}28849{_}To give the collar the same tint throughout, the     whole collar should be sponged with the same water, taking care     not to touch the flowers.
10136-8{_}28850{_}2267.
10136-8{_}28851{_}A multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses, which should be removed at once.
10136-8{_}28852{_}To remove--      2268.
10136-8{_}28853{_}_Grease-spots_ from cotton or woollen materials of fast     colours, absorbent pastes, purified bullock's-blood, and even     common soap, are used, applied to the spot when dry.
10136-8{_}28854{_}When the     colours are not fast, use fuller's-earth or pulverized     potter's-clay, laid in a layer over the spot, and press it with     a very hot iron.
10136-8{_}28855{_}2269.
10136-8{_}28856{_}For Silks, Moires, and plain or brocaded Satins, begin by     pouring over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine;     cover it over with a linen cloth, and press it with a hot iron,     changing the linen instantly.
10136-8{_}28857{_}The spot will look tarnished, for     a portion of the grease still remains: this will be removed     entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot, and a     very little rubbing.
10136-8{_}28858{_}If neatly done, no perceptible mark or     circle will remain; nor will the lustre of the richest silk be     changed, the union of the two liquids operating with no     injurious effects from rubbing.
10136-8{_}28859{_}2270.
10136-8{_}28860{_}_Fruit-spots_ are removed from white and fast-coloured     cottons by the use of chloride of soda.
10136-8{_}28861{_}Commence by cold-soaping     the article, then touch the spot with a hair-pencil or feather     dipped in the chloride, dipping it immediately into cold water,     to prevent the texture of the article being injured.
10136-8{_}28862{_}2271.
10136-8{_}28863{_}_Ink-spots_ are removed, when fresh applied to the spot,     by a few drops of hot water being poured on immediately     afterwards.
10136-8{_}28864{_}By the same process, iron-mould in linen or calico     may be removed, dipping immediately in cold water to prevent     injury to the fabric.
10136-8{_}28865{_}2272.
10136-8{_}28866{_}_Wax_ dropped on a shawl, table-cover, or cloth dress, is     easily discharged by applying spirits of wine.
10136-8{_}28867{_}2273.
10136-8{_}28868{_}_Syrups or Preserved Fruits_, by washing in lukewarm water     with a dry cloth, and pressing the spot between two folds of     clean linen.
10136-8{_}28869{_}2274.
10136-8{_}28870{_}_Essence of Lemon_ will remove grease, but will make a     spot itself in a few days.
10136-8{_}28871{_}To clean Silk or Ribbons.
10136-8{_}28872{_}2275.
10136-8{_}28873{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of gin, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}28874{_}of honey, 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}28875{_}of soft soap, 1/2 pint of water.
10136-8{_}28876{_}_Mode_.--Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture.
10136-8{_}28877{_}Have ready three vessels of cold water; take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and down in each vessel, but do not wring it; and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip.
10136-8{_}28878{_}Hang it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab it in a cloth, and iron it quickly with a very hot iron.
10136-8{_}28879{_}To remove Paint-spots from Silk Cloth.
10136-8{_}28880{_}2276.
10136-8{_}28881{_}If the fabric will bear it, sharp rubbing will frequently entirely discharge a newly-made paint-stain; but, if this is not successful, apply spirit of turpentine with a quill till the stains disappear.
10136-8{_}28882{_}To make old Crape look nearly equal to new.
10136-8{_}28883{_}2277.
10136-8{_}28884{_}Place a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape in both hands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and it will to clean and look nearly equal to new.
10136-8{_}28885{_}2278.
10136-8{_}28886{_}Linen.--Before sending linen to wash, the lady's-maid should see that everything under her charge is properly mended; for her own sake she should take care that it is sent out in an orderly manner, each class of garments by themselves, with a proper list, of which she retains a copy.
10136-8{_}28887{_}On its return, it is still more necessary to examine every piece separately, so that all missing buttons be supplied, and only the articles properly washed and in perfect repair passed into the wardrobe.
10136-8{_}28888{_}2279.
10136-8{_}28889{_}Ladies who keep a waiting-maid for their own persons are in the habit of paying visits to their friends, in which it is not unusual for the maid to accompany them; at all events, it is her duty to pack the trunks; and this requires not only knowledge but some practice, although the improved trunks and portmanteaus now made, in which there is a place for nearly everything, render this more simple than formerly.
10136-8{_}28890{_}Before packing, let the trunks be thoroughly well cleaned, and, if necessary, lined with paper, and everything intended for packing laid out on the bed or chairs, so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away; the nicer articles of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappers.
10136-8{_}28891{_}Having satisfied herself that everything wanted is laid out, and that it is in perfect order, the packing is commenced by disposing of the most bulky articles, the dressing-case and work-box, skirts, and other articles requiring room, leaving the smaller articles to fill up; finally, having satisfied herself that all is included, she should lock and cover up the trunk in its canvas case, and then pack her own box, if she is to accompany her mistress.
10136-8{_}28892{_}2280.
10136-8{_}28893{_}On reaching the house, the lady's-maid will be shown her lady's apartment; and her duties here are what they were at home; she will arrange her mistress's things, and learn which is her bell, in order to go to her when she rings.
10136-8{_}28894{_}Her meals will be taken in the housekeeper's room; and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one of her mistress or her concerns.
10136-8{_}28895{_}Her only occupation here will be attending in her lady's room, keeping her things in order, and making her rooms comfortable for her.
10136-8{_}28896{_}2281.
10136-8{_}28897{_}The evening duties of a lady's-maid are pretty nearly a repetition of those of the morning.
10136-8{_}28898{_}She is in attendance when her mistress retires; she assists her to undress if required, brushes her hair, and renders such other assistance as is demanded; removes all slops; takes care that the fire, if any, is safe, before she retires to rest herself.
10136-8{_}28899{_}2282.
10136-8{_}28900{_}Ironing is a part of the duties of a lady's-maid, and she should be able to do it in the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary.
10136-8{_}28901{_}Ironing is often badly done from inattention to a few very simple requirements.
10136-8{_}28902{_}Cleanliness is the first essential: the ironing-board, the fire, the iron, and the ironing-blanket should all be perfectly clean.
10136-8{_}28903{_}It will not be necessary here to enter into details on ironing, as full directions are given in the "Duties of the Laundry-maid."
10136-8{_}28904{_}A lady's-maid will have a great deal of "Ironing-out" to do; such as light evening dresses, muslin dresses, &c., which are not dirty enough to be washed, but merely require smoothing out to remove the creases.
10136-8{_}28905{_}In summer, particularly, an iron will be constantly required, as also a skirt-board, which should be covered with a nice clean piece of flannel.
10136-8{_}28906{_}To keep muslin dresses in order, they almost require smoothing out every time they are worn, particularly if made with many flounces.
10136-8{_}28907{_}The lady's-maid may often have to perform little services for her mistress which require care; such as restoring the colour to scorched linen, &c. &c. The following recipe is, we believe, a very good one.
10136-8{_}28908{_}To restore Whiteness to scorched Linen.
10136-8{_}28909{_}2283.
10136-8{_}28910{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}28911{_}of fuller's-earth, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}28912{_}of dried fowls' dung, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}28913{_}of soap, the juice of 2 large onions.
10136-8{_}28914{_}_Mode._--Boil all these ingredients together to the consistency of paste; spread the composition thickly over the damaged part, and if the threads be not actually consumed, after it has been allowed to dry on, and the place has subsequently been washed once or twice, every trace of scorching will disappear.
10136-8{_}28915{_}2284.
10136-8{_}28916{_}_Furs, Feathers, and Woollens_ require the constant care     of the waiting-maid.
10136-8{_}28917{_}Furs and feathers not in constant use     should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye.
10136-8{_}28918{_}From May to     September they are subject to being made the depositary of the     moth-eggs.
10136-8{_}28919{_}They should be looked too, and shaken and beaten,     from time to time, in case some of the eggs should have been     lodged in them, in spite of every precaution; laying them up     again, or rather folding them up as before, wrapping them in     brown paper, which is itself a preservative.
10136-8{_}28920{_}Shawls and cloaks,     which would be damaged by such close folds, must be looked to,     and aired and beaten, putting them away dry before the evening.
10136-8{_}28921{_}Preservatives against the Ravages of Moths.
10136-8{_}28922{_}2285.
10136-8{_}28923{_}Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Russia leather, tobacco-leaves, bog-myrtle, or anything else strongly aromatic, in the drawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved from moths are kept, and they will never take harm.
10136-8{_}28924{_}2286.
10136-8{_}28925{_}_Jewels_ are generally wrapped up in cotton, and kept in     their cases; but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to     the air, and require cleaning.
10136-8{_}28926{_}This is done by preparing clean     soap-suds, using fine toilet-soap.
10136-8{_}28927{_}Dip any article of gold,     silver, gilt, or precious stones into this lye, and dry them by     brushing with a brush of soft badgers' hair, or a fine sponge;     afterwards with a piece of fine cloth, and, lastly, with a soft     leather.
10136-8{_}28928{_}2287.
10136-8{_}28929{_}_Epaulettes_ of gold or silver, and, in general, all     articles of jewellery, may be dressed by dipping them in spirits     of wine warmed in a _bain marie,_ or shallow kettle, placed over     a slow fire or hot-plate.
10136-8{_}28930{_}2288.
10136-8{_}28931{_}The valet and lady's-maid, from their supposed influence with their master and mistress, are exposed to some temptations to which other servants are less subjected.
10136-8{_}28932{_}They are probably in communication with the tradespeople who supply articles for the toilet; such as batters, tailors, dressmakers, and perfumers.
10136-8{_}28933{_}The conduct of waiting-maid and valet to these people should be civil but independent, making reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality, if any such can be made: they should represent any inconvenience respectfully, and if an excuse seems unreasonable, put the matter fairly to master or mistress, leaving it to them to notice it further, if they think it necessary.
10136-8{_}28934{_}No expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other.
10136-8{_}28935{_}It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them; the utmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their judgment in the articles supplied--that they should represent them truly to master or mistress, without fear and without favour.
10136-8{_}28936{_}Civility to all, servility to none, is a good maxim for every one.
10136-8{_}28937{_}Deference to a master and mistress, and to their friends and visitors, is one of the implied terms of their engagement; and this deference must apply even to what may be considered their whims.
10136-8{_}28938{_}A servant is not to be seated, or wear a hat in the house, in his master's or mistress's presence; nor offer any opinion, unless asked for it; nor even to say "good night," or "good morning," except in reply to that salutation.
10136-8{_}28939{_}To preserve cut Flowers.
10136-8{_}28940{_}2289.
10136-8{_}28941{_}A bouquet of freshly-cut flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing them in a glass or vase with fresh water, in which a little charcoal has been steeped, or a small piece of camphor dissolved.
10136-8{_}28942{_}The vase should be set upon a plate or dish, and covered with a bell-glass, around the edges of which, when it comes in contact with the plate, a little water should be poured to exclude the air.
10136-8{_}28943{_}To revive cut Flowers after packing.
10136-8{_}28944{_}2290.
10136-8{_}28945{_}Plunge the stems into boiling water, and by the time the water is cold, the flowers will have revived.
10136-8{_}28946{_}Then cut afresh the ends of the stems, and keep them in fresh cold water.
10136-8{_}28947{_}UPPER AND UNDER HOUSEMAIDS.
10136-8{_}28948{_}2291.
10136-8{_}28949{_}Housemaids, in large establishments, have usually one or more assistants; in this case they are upper and under housemaids.
10136-8{_}28950{_}Dividing the work between them, the upper housemaid will probably reserve for herself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of the principal apartments, but it is her duty to see that every department is properly attended to.
10136-8{_}28951{_}The number of assistants depends on the number in the family, as well as on the style in which the establishment is kept up.
10136-8{_}28952{_}In wealthy families it is not unusual for every grown-up daughter to have her waiting-maid, whose duty it is to keep her mistress's apartments in order, thus abridging the housemaid's duties.
10136-8{_}28953{_}In others, perhaps, one waiting-maid attends on two or three, when the housemaid's assistance will be more requisite.
10136-8{_}28954{_}In fact, every establishment has some customs peculiar to itself, on which we need not dwell; the general duties are the _same in all_, perfect cleanliness and order being the object.
10136-8{_}28955{_}DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID.
10136-8{_}28956{_}2292.
10136-8{_}28957{_}"Cleanliness is next to godliness," saith the proverb, and "order" is in the next degree; the housemaid, then, may be said to be the handmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues.
10136-8{_}28958{_}Her duties are very numerous, and many of the comforts of the family depend on their performance; but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean and orderly, and desirous of giving satisfaction.
10136-8{_}28959{_}In all families, whatever the habits of the master and mistress, servants will find it advantageous to rise early; their daily work will thus come easy to them.
10136-8{_}28960{_}If they rise late, there is a struggle to overtake it, which throws an air of haste and hurry over the whole establishment.
10136-8{_}28961{_}Where the master's time is regulated by early business or professional engagements, this will, of course, regulate the hours of the servants; but even where that is not the case, servants will find great personal convenience in rising early and getting through their work in an orderly and methodical manner.
10136-8{_}28962{_}The housemaid who studies her own ease will certainly be at her work by six o'clock in the summer, and, probably, half-past six or seven in the winter months, having spent a reasonable time in her own chamber in dressing.
10136-8{_}28963{_}Earlier than this would, probably, be an unnecessary waste of coals and candle in winter.
10136-8{_}28964{_}2293.
10136-8{_}28965{_}The first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters of all the lower rooms in the house, and take up the hearth-rugs of those rooms which she is going to "do" before breakfast.
10136-8{_}28966{_}In some families, where there is only a cook and housemaid kept, and where the drawing-rooms are large, the cook has the care of the dining-room, and the housemaid that of the breakfast-room, library, and drawing-rooms.
10136-8{_}28967{_}After the shutters are all opened, she sweeps the breakfast-room, sweeping the dust towards the fire-place, of course previously removing the fonder.
10136-8{_}28968{_}She should then lay a cloth (generally made of coarse wrappering) over the carpet in front of the stove, and on this should place her housemaid's box, containing black-lead brushes, leathers, emery-paper, cloth, black lead, and all utensils necessary for cleaning a grate, with the cinder-pail on the other side.
10136-8{_}28969{_}[Illustration: CARPET-BROOMS.]
10136-8{_}28970{_}2294.
10136-8{_}28971{_}She now sweeps up the ashes, and deposits them in her cinder-pail, which is a japanned tin pail, with a wire-sifter inside, and a closely-fitting top.
10136-8{_}28972{_}In this pail the cinders are sifted, and reserved for use in the kitchen or under the copper, the ashes only being thrown away.
10136-8{_}28973{_}The cinders disposed of, she proceeds to black-lead the grate, producing the black lead, the soft brush for laying it on, her blacking and polishing brushes, from the box which contains her tools.
10136-8{_}28974{_}This housemaid's box should be kept well stocked.
10136-8{_}28975{_}Having blackened, brushed, and polished every part, and made all clean and bright, she now proceeds to lay the fire.
10136-8{_}28976{_}Sometimes it is very difficult to get a proper polish to black grates, particularly if they have been neglected, and allowed to rust at all.
10136-8{_}28977{_}Brunswick black, which is an excellent varnish for grates, may be prepared in the following manner:--  [Illustration: STOVE BRUSHES.]
10136-8{_}28978{_}[Illustration: HOUSEMAID'S BOX.]
10136-8{_}28979{_}2295.
10136-8{_}28980{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 lb.
10136-8{_}28981{_}of common asphaltum, 1/2 pint of linseed oil, 1 quart of oil of turpentine.
10136-8{_}28982{_}_Mode._--Melt the asphaltum, and add gradually to it the other two ingredients.
10136-8{_}28983{_}Apply this with a small painter's brush, and leave it to become perfectly dry.
10136-8{_}28984{_}The grate will need no other cleaning, but will merely require dusting every day, and occasionally brushing with a dry black-lead brush.
10136-8{_}28985{_}This is, of course, when no fires are used.
10136-8{_}28986{_}When they are required, the bars, cheeks, and back of the grate will need black-leading in the usual manner.
10136-8{_}28987{_}2296.
10136-8{_}28988{_}_Fire-lighting,_ however simple, is an operation requiring     some skill; a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at     the bottom in open order; over this a few pieces of paper, and     over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood; over the wood,     a course of moderate-sized pieces of coal, taking care to leave     hollow spaces between for air at the centre; and taking care to     lay the whole well back in the grate, so that the smoke may go     up the chimney, and not into the room.
10136-8{_}28989{_}This done, fire the paper     with a match from below, and, if properly laid, it will soon     burn up; the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon     communicating to the coals and cinders, provided there is plenty     of air at the centre.
10136-8{_}28990{_}2297.
10136-8{_}28991{_}A new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised     with advantage, the fire lighting from the top and burning down,     in place of being lighted and burning up from below.
10136-8{_}28992{_}This is     arranged by laying the coals at the bottom, mixed with a few     good-sized cinders, and the wood at the top, with another layer     of coals and some paper over it; the paper is lighted in the     usual way, and soon burns down to a good fire, with some economy     of fuel, as is said.
10136-8{_}28993{_}2298.
10136-8{_}28994{_}Bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect order.
10136-8{_}28995{_}A day should never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry leather the polished parts of a grate, as also the fender and fire-irons.
10136-8{_}28996{_}A careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion ever to use emery-paper for any part but the bars, which, of course, become blackened by the fire.
10136-8{_}28997{_}(Some mistresses, to save labour, have a double set of bars, one set bright for the summer, and another black set to use when fires are in requisition.)
10136-8{_}28998{_}When bright grates are once neglected, small rust-spots begin to show themselves, which a plain leather will not remove; the following method of cleaning them must then be resorted to:--First, thoroughly clean with emery-paper; then take a large smooth pebble from the road, sufficiently large to hold comfortably in the hand, with which rub the steel backwards and forwards one way, until the desired polish is obtained.
10136-8{_}28999{_}It may appear at first to scratch, but continue rubbing, and the result will be success.
10136-8{_}29000{_}The following is also an excellent polish for bright stoves and steel articles:--  2299.
10136-8{_}29001{_}INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of turpentine, 1 ditto of sweet oil, emery powder.
10136-8{_}29002{_}_Mode._--Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together, stirring in sufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thickness of cream.
10136-8{_}29003{_}Put it on the article with a piece of soft flannel, rub off quickly with another piece, then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean leather.
10136-8{_}29004{_}2300.
10136-8{_}29005{_}The several fires lighted, the housemaid proceeds with her dusting, and polishing the several pieces of furniture in the breakfast-parlour, leaving no corner unvisited.
10136-8{_}29006{_}Before sweeping the carpet, it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tea-leaves, which not only lay all dust, but give a slightly fragrant smell to the room.
10136-8{_}29007{_}It is now in order for the reception of the family; and where there is neither footman nor parlour-maid, she now proceeds to the dressing-room, and lights her mistress's fire, if she is in the habit of having one to dress by.
10136-8{_}29008{_}Her mistress is called, hot water placed in the dressing-room for her use, her clothes--as far as they are under the house-maid's charge--put before the fire to air, hanging a fire-guard on the bars where there is one, while she proceeds to prepare the breakfast.
10136-8{_}29009{_}2301.
10136-8{_}29010{_}In summer the housemaid's work is considerably abridged: she throws open the windows of the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms, that they may receive the fresh morning air before they are occupied; she prepares the breakfast-room by sweeping the carpet, rubbing tables and chairs, dusting mantel-shelf and picture-frames with a light brush, dusting the furniture, and beating and sweeping the rug; she cleans the grate when necessary, and replaces the white paper or arranges the shavings with which it is filled, leaving everything clean and tidy for breakfast.
10136-8{_}29011{_}It is not enough, however, in cleaning furniture, just to pass lightly over the surface; the rims and legs of tables, and the backs and legs of chairs and sofas, should be rubbed vigorously daily; if there is a book-case, every corner of every pane and ledge requires to be carefully wiped, so that not a speck of dust can be found in the room.
10136-8{_}29012{_}2302.
10136-8{_}29013{_}After the breakfast-room is finished, the housemaid should proceed to sweep down the stairs, commencing at the top, whilst the cook has the charge of the hall, door-step, and passages.
10136-8{_}29014{_}After this she should go into the drawing-room, cover up every article of furniture that is likely to spoil, with large dusting-sheets, and put the chairs together, by turning them seat to seat, and, in fact, make as much room as possible, by placing all the loose furniture in the middle of the room, whilst she sweeps the corners and sides.
10136-8{_}29015{_}When this is accomplished, the furniture can then be put back in its place, and the middle of the room swept, sweeping the dirt, as before said, towards the fireplace.
10136-8{_}29016{_}The same rules should be observed in cleaning the drawing-room grates as we have just stated, putting down the cloth, before commencing, to prevent the carpet from getting soiled.
10136-8{_}29017{_}In the country, a room would not require sweeping thoroughly like this more than twice a week; but the housemaid should go over it every morning with a dust-pan and broom, taking up every crumb and piece she may see.
10136-8{_}29018{_}After the sweeping she should leave the room, shut the door, and proceed to lay the breakfast.
10136-8{_}29019{_}Where there is neither footman nor parlour-maid kept, the duty of laying the breakfast-cloth rests on the housemaid.
10136-8{_}29020{_}[Illustration: BANISTER-BROOM.]
10136-8{_}29021{_}[Illustration: STAIRCASE-BROOM.]
10136-8{_}29022{_}2303.
10136-8{_}29023{_}Before laying the cloth for breakfast, the heater of the tea-urn is to be placed in the hottest part of the kitchen fire; or, where the kettle is used, boiled on the kitchen fire, and then removed to the parlour, where it is kept hot.
10136-8{_}29024{_}Having washed herself free from the dust arising from the morning's work, the housemaid collects the breakfast-things on her tray, takes the breakfast-cloth from the napkin press, and carries them all on the tray into the parlour; arranges them on the table, placing a sufficiency of knives, forks, and salt-cellars for the family, and takes the tray back to the pantry; gets a supply of milk, cream, and bread; fills the butter-dish, taking care that the salt is plentiful, and soft and dry, and that hot plates and egg-cups are ready where warm meat or eggs are served, and that butter-knife and bread-knife are in their places.
10136-8{_}29025{_}And now she should give the signal for breakfast, holding herself ready to fill the urn with hot water, or hand the kettle, and take in the rolls, toast, and other eatables, with which the cook supplies her, when the breakfast-room bell rings; bearing in mind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a dirty apron, and that everything is to be handed on a tray; that she is to hand everything she may be required to supply, on the left hand of the person she is serving, and that all is done quietly and without bustle or hurry.
10136-8{_}29026{_}In some families, where there is a large number to attend on, the cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy upstairs in the bedrooms, or sweeping, dusting, and putting the drawing-room in order.
10136-8{_}29027{_}2304.
10136-8{_}29028{_}Breakfast served, the housemaid proceeds to the bed-chambers, throws up the sashes, if not already done, pulls up the blinds, throwing back curtains at the same time, and opens the beds, by removing the clothes, placing them over a horse, or, failing that, over the backs of chairs.
10136-8{_}29029{_}She now proceeds to empty the slops.
10136-8{_}29030{_}In doing this, everything is emptied into the slop-pail, leaving a little scalding-hot water for a minute in such vessels as require it; adding a drop of turpentine to the water, when that is not sufficient to cleanse them.
10136-8{_}29031{_}The basin is emptied, well rinsed with clean water, and carefully wiped; the ewers emptied and washed; finally, the water-jugs themselves emptied out and rinsed, and wiped dry.
10136-8{_}29032{_}As soon as this is done, she should remove and empty the pails, taking care that they also are well washed, scalded, and wiped as soon as they are empty.
10136-8{_}29033{_}2305.
10136-8{_}29034{_}Next follows bedmaking, at which the cook or kitchen-maid, where one is kept, usually assists; but, before beginning, velvet chairs, or other things injured by dust, should be removed to another room.
10136-8{_}29035{_}In bedmaking, the fancy of its occupant should be consulted; some like beds sloping from the top towards the feet, swelling slightly in the middle; others, perfectly flat: a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to the taste of the sleeper, taking care to shake, beat, and turn it well in the process.
10136-8{_}29036{_}Some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress; in which case a feather bed is usually beneath, resting on a second mattress, and a straw paillasse at the bottom.
10136-8{_}29037{_}In this case, the mattresses should change places daily; the feather bed placed on the mattress shaken, beaten, taken up and opened several times, so as thoroughly to separate the feathers: if too large to be thus handled, the maid should shake and beat one end first, and then the other, smoothing it afterwards equally all over into the required shape, and place the mattress gently over it.
10136-8{_}29038{_}Any feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will put back through the seam of the tick; she will also be careful to sew up any stitch that gives way the moment it is discovered.
10136-8{_}29039{_}The bedclothes are laid on, beginning with an under blanket and sheet, which are tucked under the mattress at the bottom.
10136-8{_}29040{_}The bolster is then beaten and shaken, and put on, the top of the sheet rolled round it, and the sheet tucked in all round.
10136-8{_}29041{_}The pillows and other bedclothes follow, and the counterpane over all, which should fall in graceful folds, and at equal distance from the ground all round.
10136-8{_}29042{_}The curtains are drawn to the head and folded neatly across the bed, and the whole finished in a smooth and graceful manner.
10136-8{_}29043{_}Where spring-mattresses are used, care should be taken that the top one is turned every day.
10136-8{_}29044{_}The housemaid should now take up in a dustpan any pieces that may be on the carpet; she should dust the room, shut the door, and proceed to another room.
10136-8{_}29045{_}When all the bedrooms are finished, she should dust the stairs, and polish the handrail of the banisters, and see that all ledges, window-sills, &c., are quite free from dust.
10136-8{_}29046{_}It will be necessary for the housemaid to divide her work, so that she may not have too much to do on certain days, and not sufficient to fill up her time on other days.
10136-8{_}29047{_}In the country, bedrooms should be swept and thoroughly cleaned once a week; and to be methodical and regular in her work, the housemaid should have certain days for doing certain rooms thoroughly.
10136-8{_}29048{_}For instance, the drawing-room on Monday, two bedrooms on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, and so on, reserving a day for thoroughly cleaning the plate, bedroom candlesticks, &c. &c., which she will have to do where there is no parlour-maid or footman kept.
10136-8{_}29049{_}By this means the work will be divided, and there will be no unnecessary bustling and hurrying, as is the case where the work is done any time, without rule or regulation.
10136-8{_}29050{_}[Illustration: SCRUBBING-BRUSH.]
10136-8{_}29051{_}2306.
10136-8{_}29052{_}Once a week, when a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned, the house-maid should commence by brushing the mattresses of the bed before it is made; she should then make it, shake the curtains, lay them smoothly on the bed, and pin or tuck up the bottom valance, so that she may be able to sweep under the bed.
10136-8{_}29053{_}She should then unloop the window-curtains, shake them, and pin them high up out of the way.
10136-8{_}29054{_}After clearing the dressing-table, and the room altogether of little articles of china, &c. &c., she should shake the toilet-covers, fold them up, and lay them on the bed, over which a large dusting-sheet should be thrown.
10136-8{_}29055{_}She should then sweep the room; first of all sprinkling the carpet with well-squeezed tea-leaves, or a little freshly-pulled grass, when this is obtainable.
10136-8{_}29056{_}After the carpet is swept, and the grate cleaned, she should wash with soap and water, with a little soda in it, the washing-table apparatus, removing all marks or fur round the jugs, caused by the water.
10136-8{_}29057{_}The water-bottles and tumblers must also have her attention, as well as the top of the washing-stand, which should be cleaned with soap and flannel if it be marble: if of polished mahogany, no soap must be used.
10136-8{_}29058{_}When these are all clean and arranged in their places, the housemaid should scrub the floor where it is not covered with carpet, under the beds, and round the wainscot.
10136-8{_}29059{_}She should use as little soap and soda as possible, as too free a use of these articles is liable to give the boards a black appearance.
10136-8{_}29060{_}In the country, cold soft water, a clean scrubbing-brush, and a willing arm, are all that are required to make bedroom floors look white.
10136-8{_}29061{_}In winter it is not advisable to scrub rooms too often, as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that season of the year, and nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons to sleep in a damp room.
10136-8{_}29062{_}The housemaid should now dust the furniture, blinds, ornaments, &c.; polish the looking-glass; arrange the toilet-cover and muslin; remove the cover from the bed, and straighten and arrange the curtains and counterpane.
10136-8{_}29063{_}A bedroom should be cleaned like this every week.
10136-8{_}29064{_}There are times, however, when it is necessary to have the carpet up; this should be done once a year in the country, and twice a year in large cities.
10136-8{_}29065{_}The best time for these arrangements is spring and autumn, when the bed-furniture requires changing to suit the seasons of the year.
10136-8{_}29066{_}After arranging the furniture, it should all be well rubbed and polished; and for this purpose the housemaid should provide herself with an old silk pocket-handkerchief, to finish the polishing.
10136-8{_}29067{_}[Illustration: LONG HAIR-BROOM.]
10136-8{_}29068{_}2307.
10136-8{_}29069{_}As modern furniture is now nearly always French-polished, it should often be rubbed with an old silk rubber, or a fine cloth or duster, to keep it free from smears.
10136-8{_}29070{_}Three or four times a year any of the following polishes may be applied with very great success, as any of them make French-polished furniture look very well.
10136-8{_}29071{_}One precaution must be taken,--not to put too much of the polish on at one time, and _to rub, not smear_ it over the articles.
10136-8{_}29072{_}FURNITURE POLISH.
10136-8{_}29073{_}2308.
10136-8{_}29074{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of linseed-oil, 1/4 pint of vinegar, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}29075{_}of spirits of salts, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}29076{_}of muriatic antimony.
10136-8{_}29077{_}_Mode_.--Mix all well together, and shake before using.

10136-8{_}29079{_}2309.
10136-8{_}29080{_}INGREDIENTS.--Equal proportions of linseed-oil, turpentine, vinegar, and spirits of wine.
10136-8{_}29081{_}_Mode_.--When used, shake the mixture well, and rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag, and polish with a clean duster.
10136-8{_}29082{_}Vinegar and oil, rubbed in with flannel, and the furniture rubbed with a clean duster, produce a very good polish.

10136-8{_}29087{_}of white wax, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}29088{_}of curd soap, 1 pint of turpentine, 1 pint of boiled water.

10136-8{_}29094{_}In cleaning candlesticks, as in every other cleaning, she should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone; the knife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose; the tallow-grease should be thrown into a box kept for the purpose; the same with everything connected with the lamp-trimming; the best mode of doing which she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the oil; always bearing in mind, however, that without perfect cleanliness, which involves occasional scalding, no lamp can be kept in order.
10136-8{_}29095{_}2312.
10136-8{_}29096{_}The drawing and dining-room, inasmuch as everything there is more costly and valuable, require even more care.
10136-8{_}29097{_}When the carpets are of the kind known as velvet-pile, they require to be swept firmly by a hard whisk brush, made of cocoanut fibre.
10136-8{_}29098{_}2313.
10136-8{_}29099{_}The furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a soft cloth, that it may be left perfectly free from dust; or where that is beyond reach, with a brush made of long feathers, or a goose's wing.
10136-8{_}29100{_}The sofas are swept in the same manner, slightly beaten, the cushions shaken and smoothed, the picture-frames swept, and everything arranged in its proper place.
10136-8{_}29101{_}This, of course, applies to dining as well as drawing-room and morning-room.
10136-8{_}29102{_}And now the housemaid may dress herself for the day, and prepare for the family dinner, at which she must attend.
10136-8{_}29103{_}2314.
10136-8{_}29104{_}We need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying the dinner-table.
10136-8{_}29105{_}At the family dinner, even where no footman waits, the routine will be the same.
10136-8{_}29106{_}In most families the cloth is laid with the slips on each side, with napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and wine and finger glasses on all occasions.
10136-8{_}29107{_}[Illustration: BUTLER'S TRAY AND STAND.]
10136-8{_}29108{_}2315.
10136-8{_}29109{_}She should ascertain that her plate is in order, glasses free from smears, water-bottles and decanters the same, and everything ready on her tray, that she may be able to lay her cloth properly.
10136-8{_}29110{_}Few things add more to the neat and comfortable appearance of a dinner-table than well-polished plate; indeed, the state of the plate is a certain indication of a well-managed or ill-managed household.
10136-8{_}29111{_}Nothing is easier than to keep plate in good order, and yet many servants, from stupidity and ignorance, make it the greatest trouble of all things under their care.
10136-8{_}29112{_}It should be remembered, that it is utterly impossible to make greasy silver take a polish; and that as spoons and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease, they must require good washing in soap-and-water to remove it.
10136-8{_}29113{_}Silver should be washed with a soapy flannel in one water, rinsed in another, and then wiped dry with a dry cloth.
10136-8{_}29114{_}The plate so washed may be polished with the plate-rags, as in the following directions:--Once a week all the plate should receive a thorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder, as directed in the first recipe for cleaning plate; and where the housemaid can find time, rubbed every day with the plate-rags.
10136-8{_}29115{_}2316.
10136-8{_}29116{_}Hartshorn, we may observe, is one of the best possible     ingredients for plate-powder in daily use.
10136-8{_}29117{_}It leaves on the     silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time does less     injury than anything else.
10136-8{_}29118{_}It has also the advantage of being     very cheap; almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes     containing more or less of quicksilver, in some form or another;     and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle.
10136-8{_}29119{_}If any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver     on plate, he has only to rub a little of it on one place for     some time,--on the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance, and     he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure.
10136-8{_}29120{_}To Clean Plate.
10136-8{_}29121{_}_A very excellent method._  [Illustration: PLATE-BRUSH.]
10136-8{_}29122{_}2317.
10136-8{_}29123{_}Wash the plate well to remove all grease, in a strong lather of common yellow soap and boiling water, and wipe it quite dry; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required, into a thick paste, with cold water or spirits of wine; smear this lightly over the plate with a piece of soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry.
10136-8{_}29124{_}When perfectly dry, brush it off quite clean with a soft plate-brush, and polish the plate with a dry leather.
10136-8{_}29125{_}If the plate be very dirty, or much tarnished, spirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water for mixing the paste.
10136-8{_}29126{_}Plate-rags for daily use.
10136-8{_}29127{_}2318.
10136-8{_}29128{_}Boil soft rags (nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings) in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder, in the proportion of 1 oz.
10136-8{_}29129{_}of powder to a pint of milk; boil them for 5 minutes; wring them as soon as they are taken out, for a moment, in cold water, and dry them before the fire.
10136-8{_}29130{_}With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use.
10136-8{_}29131{_}A most beautiful deep polish will be produced, and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft cloth, before it is again put on the table.
10136-8{_}29132{_}2319.
10136-8{_}29133{_}For waiting at table, the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly dressed, and, if possible, her dress made with closed sleeves, the large open ones dipping and falling into everything on the table, and being very much in the way.
10136-8{_}29134{_}She should not wear creaking boots, and should move about the room as noiselessly as possible, anticipating people's wants by handing them things without being asked for them, and altogether be as quiet as possible.
10136-8{_}29135{_}It will be needless here to repeat what we have already said respecting waiting at table, in the duties of the butler and footman: rules that are good to be observed by them, are equally good for the parlour-maid or housemaid.
10136-8{_}29136{_}2320.
10136-8{_}29137{_}The housemaid having announced that dinner is on the table, will hand the soup, fish, meat, or side-dishes to the different members of the family; but in families who do not spend much of the day together, they will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast; the housemaid will be required, after all are helped, if her master does not wish her to stay in the room, to go on with her work of cleaning up in the pantry, and answer the bell when rung.
10136-8{_}29138{_}In this case she will place a pile of plates on the table or a dumbwaiter, within reach of her master and mistress, and leave the room.
10136-8{_}29139{_}[Illustration: CRUMB-BRUSH].
10136-8{_}29140{_}2321.
10136-8{_}29141{_}Dinner over, the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the tray, places the dirty knives and forks in the basket prepared for them, folds up the napkins in the ring which indicates by which member of the family it has been used, brushes off the crumbs on the hand-tray kept for the purpose, folds up the table-cloth in the folds already made, and places it in the linen-press to be smoothed out.
10136-8{_}29142{_}After every meal the table should be rubbed, all marks from hot plates removed, and the table-cover thrown over, and the room restored to its usual order.
10136-8{_}29143{_}If the family retire to the drawing-room, or any other room, it is a good practice to throw up the sash to admit fresh air and ventilate the room.
10136-8{_}29144{_}2322.
10136-8{_}29145{_}The housemaid's evening service consists in washing up the dinner-things, the plate, plated articles, and glasses, restoring everything to its place; cleaning up her pantry, and putting away everything for use when next required; lastly, preparing for tea, as the time approaches, by setting the things out on the tray, getting the urn or kettle ready, with cream and other things usually partaken of at that meal.
10136-8{_}29146{_}2323.
10136-8{_}29147{_}In summer-time the windows of all the bedrooms, which have been closed during the heat of the day, should be thrown open for an hour or so after sunset, in order to air them.
10136-8{_}29148{_}Before dark they should be closed, the bedclothes turned down, and the night-clothes laid in order for use when required.
10136-8{_}29149{_}During winter, where fires are required in the dressing-rooms, they should be lighted an hour before the usual time of retiring, placing a fire-guard before each fire.
10136-8{_}29150{_}At the same time, the night-things on the horse should be placed before it to be aired, with a tin can of hot water, if the mistress is in the habit of washing before going to bed.
10136-8{_}29151{_}We may add, that there is no greater preservative of beauty than washing the face every night in hot water.
10136-8{_}29152{_}The housemaid will probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and put her dress in order for the morrow; in which case her duties are very much those of the lady's-maid.
10136-8{_}29153{_}2324.
10136-8{_}29154{_}And now the fire is made up for the night, the fireguard replaced, and everything in the room in order for the night, the housemaid taking care to leave the night-candle and matches together in a convenient place, should they be required.
10136-8{_}29155{_}It is usual in summer to remove all highly fragrant flowers from sleeping-rooms, the impression being that their scent is injurious in a close chamber.
10136-8{_}29156{_}2325.
10136-8{_}29157{_}On leisure days, the housemaid should be able to do some needlework for her mistress,--such as turning and mending sheets and darning the house linen, or assist her in anything she may think fit to give her to do.
10136-8{_}29158{_}For this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid, in a small family, should be an expert needlewoman; as, if she be a good manager and an active girl, she will have time on her hands to get through plenty of work.
10136-8{_}29159{_}2326.
10136-8{_}29160{_}_Periodical Cleanings_.--Besides the daily routine which we have described, there are portions of every house which can only be thoroughly cleaned occasionally; at which time the whole house usually undergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way.
10136-8{_}29161{_}On these occasions it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards; moving everything out of the room; washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water; pulling down the beds and thoroughly cleansing all the joints; "scrubbing" the floor; beating feather beds, mattress, and paillasse, and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in its place.
10136-8{_}29162{_}2327.
10136-8{_}29163{_}This general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early summer, when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains.
10136-8{_}29164{_}Carpets are at the same time taken up and beaten, except where the mistress of the house has been worried into an experiment by the often-reiterated question, "Why beat your carpets?"
10136-8{_}29165{_}In this case she will probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning process, and arranged with the company to send for them on the morning when cleaning commenced.
10136-8{_}29166{_}It is hardly necessary to repeat, that on this occasion every article is to be gone over, the French-polished furniture well rubbed and polished.
10136-8{_}29167{_}The same thorough system of cleaning should be done throughout the house; the walls cleaned where painted, and swept down with a soft broom or feather brush where papered; the window and bed curtains, which have been replaced with muslin ones, carefully brushed, or, if they require it, cleaned; lamps not likely to be required, washed out with hot water, dried, and cleaned.
10136-8{_}29168{_}The several grates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments; and we know none prettier than the following, which the housemaid may provide at a small expense to her mistress:--Purchase two yards and a half of crinoline muslin, and tear it into small strips, the selvage way of the material, about an inch wide; strip this thread by thread on each side, leaving the four centre threads; this gives about six-and-thirty pieces, fringed on each side, which are tied together at one end, and fastened to the trap of the register, while the threads, unravelled, are spread gracefully about the grate, the lower part of which is filled with paper shavings.
10136-8{_}29169{_}This makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament, which is much stronger, besides, than those usually purchased.
10136-8{_}29170{_}[Illustration: CORNICE-BRUSH.]
10136-8{_}29171{_}[Illustration: HOUSE-PAIL.]
10136-8{_}29172{_}[Illustration: DUSTING-BRUSH.]
10136-8{_}29173{_}2328.
10136-8{_}29174{_}As winter approaches, this house-cleaning will have to be repeated, and the warm bed and window curtains replaced.
10136-8{_}29175{_}The process of scouring and cleaning is again necessary, and must be gone through, beginning at the top, and going through the house, down to the kitchens.
10136-8{_}29176{_}2329.
10136-8{_}29177{_}Independently of these daily and periodical cleanings, other occupations will present themselves from time to time, which the housemaid will have to perform.
10136-8{_}29178{_}When spots show on polished furniture, they can generally be restored by soap-and-water and a sponge, the polish being brought out by using a little polish, and then well rubbing it.
10136-8{_}29179{_}Again, drawers which draw out stiffly may be made to move more easily if the spot where they press is rubbed over with a little soap.
10136-8{_}29180{_}2330.
10136-8{_}29181{_}Chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and replaced, by means of a little glue applied to it.
10136-8{_}29182{_}Liquid glue, which is sold prepared in bottles, is very useful to have in the house, as it requires no melting; and anything broken can be so quickly repaired.
10136-8{_}29183{_}2331.
10136-8{_}29184{_}Breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that can happen in a family, and it is, probably, a greater annoyance to a right-minded servant than to the mistress.
10136-8{_}29185{_}A neat-handed housemaid may sometimes repair these breakages, where they are not broken in very conspicuous places, by joining the pieces very neatly together with a cement made as follows:--Dissolve an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity of highly-rectified spirits of wine; then soften an ounce of isinglass in warm water, and, finally, dissolve it in rum or brandy, till it forms a thick jelly.
10136-8{_}29186{_}Mix the isinglass and gum mastic together, adding a quarter of an ounce of finely-powdered gum ammoniac; put the whole into an earthen pipkin, and in a warm place, till they are thoroughly incorporated together; pour it into a small phial, and cork it down for use.
10136-8{_}29187{_}2332.
10136-8{_}29188{_}In using it, dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver teaspoon over a lighted candle.
10136-8{_}29189{_}The broken pieces of glass or china being warmed, and touched with the now liquid cement, join the parts neatly together, and hold in their places till the cement has set; then wipe away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint, and leave it for twelve hours without touching it: the joint will be as strong as the china itself, and if neatly done, it will show no joining.
10136-8{_}29190{_}It is essential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold water.
10136-8{_}29191{_}USEFUL RECIPES FOR HOUSEMAIDS.
10136-8{_}29192{_}To clean Marble.
10136-8{_}29193{_}2333.
10136-8{_}29194{_}Mix with 1/4 pint of soap lees, 1/2 gill of turpentine, sufficient pipe-clay and bullock's gall to make the whole into rather a thick paste.
10136-8{_}29195{_}Apply it to the marble with a soft brush, and after a day or two, when quite dry, rub it off with a soft rag.
10136-8{_}29196{_}Apply this a second or third time till the marble is quite clean.
10136-8{_}29197{_}Another method.
10136-8{_}29198{_}2334.
10136-8{_}29199{_}Take two parts of soda, one of pumice-stone, and one of finely-powdered chalk.
10136-8{_}29200{_}Sift these through a fine sieve, and mix them into a paste with water.
10136-8{_}29201{_}Rub this well all over the marble, and the stains will be removed; then wash it with soap-and-water, and a beautiful bright polish will be produced.
10136-8{_}29202{_}To clean Floorcloth.
10136-8{_}29203{_}2335.
10136-8{_}29204{_}After having washed the floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp flannel, wet it all over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth, when a most beautiful polish will be brought out.
10136-8{_}29205{_}Some persons use for rubbing a well-waxed flannel; but this in general produces an unpleasant slipperiness, which is not the case with the milk.
10136-8{_}29206{_}To clean Decanters.
10136-8{_}29207{_}2336.
10136-8{_}29208{_}Roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper; wet them, and soap them well.
10136-8{_}29209{_}Put them into the decanters about one quarter full of warm water; shake them well for a few minutes, then rinse with clear cold water; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put the decanters to drain, and when dry they will be almost as bright as new ones.
10136-8{_}29210{_}To brighten Gilt Frames.
10136-8{_}29211{_}2337.
10136-8{_}29212{_}Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about 1-1/2 pint of water, and in this boil 4 or 5 bruised onions, or garlic, which will answer the same purpose.
10136-8{_}29213{_}Strain off the liquid, and with it, when cold, wash, with a soft brush, any gilding which requires restoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as new work.
10136-8{_}29214{_}To preserve bright Grates or Fire-irons from Rust.
10136-8{_}29215{_}2338.
10136-8{_}29216{_}Make a strong paste of fresh lime and water, and with a fine brush smear it as thickly as possible over all the polished surface requiring preservation.
10136-8{_}29217{_}By this simple means, all the grates and fire-irons in an empty house may be kept for months free from harm, without further care or attention.
10136-8{_}29218{_}German Furniture-Gloss.
10136-8{_}29219{_}2339.
10136-8{_}29220{_}INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}29221{_}yellow wax, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}29222{_}black rosin, 2 oz.
10136-8{_}29223{_}of oil of turpentine.
10136-8{_}29224{_}_Mode_.--Cut the wax into small pieces, and melt it in a pipkin, with the rosin pounded very fine.
10136-8{_}29225{_}Stir in gradually, while these two ingredients are quite warm, the oil of turpentine.
10136-8{_}29226{_}Keep this composition well covered for use in a tin or earthen pot.
10136-8{_}29227{_}A little of this gloss should be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth, and the furniture well rubbed with it; afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth.
10136-8{_}29228{_}DUTIES OF THE MAID-OF-ALL-WORK.
10136-8{_}29229{_}2340.
10136-8{_}29230{_}The general servant, or maid-of-all-work, is perhaps the only one of her class deserving of commiseration: her life is a solitary one, and in, some places, her work is never done.
10136-8{_}29231{_}She is also subject to rougher treatment than either the house or kitchen-maid, especially in her earlier career: she starts in life, probably a girl of thirteen, with some small tradesman's wife as her mistress, just a step above her in the social scale; and although the class contains among them many excellent, kind-hearted women, it also contains some very rough specimens of the feminine gender, and to some of these it occasionally falls to give our maid-of-all-work her first lessons in her multifarious occupations: the mistress's commands are the measure of the maid-of-all-work's duties.
10136-8{_}29232{_}By the time she has become a tolerable servant, she is probably engaged in some respectable tradesman's house, where she has to rise with the lark, for she has to do in her own person all the work which in larger establishments is performed by cook, kitchen-maid, and housemaid, and occasionally the part of a footman's duty, which consists in carrying messages.
10136-8{_}29233{_}2341.
10136-8{_}29234{_}The general servant's duties commence by opening the shutters (and windows, if the weather permits) of all the lower apartments in the house; she should then brush up her kitchen-range, light the fire, clear away the ashes, clean the hearth, and polish with a leather the bright parts of the range, doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible, that no more time be wasted than is necessary.
10136-8{_}29235{_}After putting on the kettle, she should then proceed to the dining-room or parlour to get it in order for breakfast.
10136-8{_}29236{_}She should first roll up the rug, take up the fender, shake and fold up the table-cloth, then sweep the room, carrying the dirt towards the fireplace; a coarse cloth should then be laid down over the carpet, and she should proceed to clean the grate, having all her utensils close to her.
10136-8{_}29237{_}When the grate is finished, the ashes cleared away, the hearth cleaned, and the fender put back in its place, she must dust the furniture, not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs; and if there are any ornaments or things on the sideboard, she must not dust round them, but lift them up on to another place, dust well where they have been standing, and then replace the things.
10136-8{_}29238{_}Nothing annoys a particular mistress so much as to find, when she comes down stairs, different articles of furniture looking as if they had never been dusted.
10136-8{_}29239{_}If the servant is at all methodical, and gets into a habit of _doing_ a room in a certain way, she will scarcely ever leave her duties neglected.
10136-8{_}29240{_}After the rug is put down, the table-cloth arranged, and everything in order, she should lay the cloth for breakfast, and then shut the dining-room door.
10136-8{_}29241{_}2342.
10136-8{_}29242{_}The hall must now be swept, the mats shaken, the door-step cleaned, and any brass knockers or handles polished up with the leather.
10136-8{_}29243{_}If the family breakfast very early, the tidying of the hall must then be deferred till after that meal.
10136-8{_}29244{_}After cleaning the boots that are absolutely required, the servant should now wash her hands and face, put on a clean white apron, and be ready for her mistress when she comes down stairs.
10136-8{_}29245{_}In families where there is much work to do before breakfast, the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in wear, so that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more time to do them, in the daytime.
10136-8{_}29246{_}This arrangement is, perhaps, scarcely necessary in the summer-time, when there are no grates to clean every morning; but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful to lighten a servant-of-all-work's duties as much as possible.
10136-8{_}29247{_}[Illustration: BLACKING-BRUSH BOX.]
10136-8{_}29248{_}2343.
10136-8{_}29249{_}She will now carry the urn into the dining-room, where her mistress will make the tea or coffee, and sometimes will boil the eggs, to insure them being done to her liking.
10136-8{_}29250{_}In the mean time the servant cooks, if required, the bacon, kidneys, fish, &c.;--if cold meat is to be served, she must always send it to table on a clean dish, and nicely garnished with tufts of parsley, if this is obtainable.
10136-8{_}29251{_}2344.
10136-8{_}29252{_}After she has had her own breakfast, and whilst the family are finishing theirs, she should go upstairs into the bedrooms, open all the windows, strip the clothes off the beds, and leave them to air whilst she is clearing away the breakfast things.
10136-8{_}29253{_}She should then take up the crumbs in a dustpan from under the table, put the chairs in their places, and sweep up the hearth.
10136-8{_}29254{_}2345.
10136-8{_}29255{_}The breakfast things washed up, the kitchen should be tidied, so that it may be neat when her mistress comes in to give the orders for the day: after receiving these orders, the servant should go upstairs again, with a jug of boiling water, the slop-pail, and two cloths.
10136-8{_}29256{_}After emptying the slops, and scalding the vessels with the boiling water, and wiping them thoroughly dry, she should wipe the top of the wash-table and arrange it all in order.
10136-8{_}29257{_}She then proceeds to make the beds, in which occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress, or, if she have any daughters, by one of them.
10136-8{_}29258{_}Before commencing to make the bed, the servant should put on a large bed-apron, kept for this purpose only, which should be made very wide, to button round the waist and meet behind, while it should be made as long as the dress.
10136-8{_}29259{_}By adopting this plan, the blacks and dirt on servants' dresses (which at all times it is impossible to help) will not rub off on to the bed-clothes, mattresses, and bed furniture.
10136-8{_}29260{_}When the beds are made, the rooms should be dusted, the stairs lightly swept down, hall furniture, closets, &c., dusted.
10136-8{_}29261{_}The lady of the house, where there is but one servant kept, frequently takes charge of the drawing-room herself, that is to say, dusting it; the servant sweeping, cleaning windows, looking-glasses, grates, and rough work of that sort.
10136-8{_}29262{_}If there are many ornaments and knick-knacks about the room, it is certainly better for the mistress to dust these herself, as a maid-of-all-work's hands are not always in a condition to handle delicate ornaments.
10136-8{_}29263{_}2346.
10136-8{_}29264{_}Now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in order, the servant goes to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the dinner, in which very often her mistress will assist her.
10136-8{_}29265{_}She should put on a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in, which may be easily replaced by a white one if required.
10136-8{_}29266{_}2347.
10136-8{_}29267{_}Half an hour before dinner is ready, she should lay the cloth, that everything may be in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner, and take all into the dining-room that is likely to be required, in the way of knives, forks, spoons, bread, salt, water, &c. &c. By exercising a little forethought, much confusion and trouble may be saved both to mistress and servant, by getting everything ready for the dinner in good time.
10136-8{_}29268{_}2348.
10136-8{_}29269{_}After taking in the dinner, when every one is seated, she removes the covers, hands the plates round, and pours out the beer; and should be careful to hand everything on the left side of the person she is waiting on.
10136-8{_}29270{_}2349.
10136-8{_}29271{_}We need scarcely say that a maid-of-all-work cannot stay in the dining-room during the whole of dinner-time, as she must dish up her pudding, or whatever is served after the first course.
10136-8{_}29272{_}When she sees every one helped, she should leave the room to make her preparations for the next course; and anything that is required, such as bread, &c., people may assist themselves to in the absence of the servant.
10136-8{_}29273{_}2350.
10136-8{_}29274{_}When the dinner things are cleared away, the servant should sweep up the crumbs in the dining-room, sweep the hearth, and lightly dust the furniture, then sit down to her own dinner.
10136-8{_}29275{_}[Illustration: KNIFE-CLEANING MACHINE]  2351.
10136-8{_}29276{_}After this, she washes up and puts away the dinner things, sweeps the kitchen, dusts and tidies it, and puts on the kettle for tea.
10136-8{_}29277{_}She should now, before dressing herself for the afternoon, clean her knives, boots, and shoes, and do any other dirty work in the scullery that may be necessary.
10136-8{_}29278{_}Knife-cleaning machines are rapidly taking the place, in most households, of the old knife-board.
10136-8{_}29279{_}The saving of labour by the knife-cleaner is very great, and its performance of the work is very satisfactory.
10136-8{_}29280{_}Small and large machines are manufactured, some cleaning only four knives, whilst others clean as many as twelve at once.
10136-8{_}29281{_}Nothing can be more simple than the process of machine knife-cleaning; and although, in a very limited household, the substitution of the machine for the board may not be necessary, yet we should advise all housekeepers, to whom the outlay is not a difficulty, to avail themselves of the services of a machine.
10136-8{_}29282{_}We have already spoken of its management in the "Duties of the Footman," No.
10136-8{_}29283{_}2177.
10136-8{_}29284{_}2352.
10136-8{_}29285{_}When the servant is dressed, she takes in the tea, and after tea turns down the beds, sees that the water-jugs and bottles are full, closes the windows, and draws down the blinds.
10136-8{_}29286{_}If the weather is very warm, these are usually left open until the last thing at night, to cool the rooms.
10136-8{_}29287{_}2353.
10136-8{_}29288{_}The routine of a general servant's duties depends upon the kind of situation she occupies; but a systematic maid-of-all-work should so contrive to divide her work, that every day in the week may have its proper share.
10136-8{_}29289{_}By this means she is able to keep the house clean with less fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the week.
10136-8{_}29290{_}Supposing there are five bedrooms in the house, two sitting-rooms, kitchen, scullery, and the usual domestic offices:--on Monday she should thoroughly clean the drawing-room; on Tuesday, two of the bedrooms; on Wednesday, two more; on Thursday, the other bedroom and stairs; on Friday morning she should sweep the dining-room very thoroughly, clean the hall, and in the afternoon her kitchen tins and bright utensils.
10136-8{_}29291{_}By arranging her work in this manner, no undue proportion will fall to Saturday's share, and she will then have this day for cleaning plate, cleaning her kitchen, and arranging everything in nice order.
10136-8{_}29292{_}The regular work must, of course, be performed in the usual manner, as we have endeavoured to describe.
10136-8{_}29293{_}2354.
10136-8{_}29294{_}Before retiring to bed, she will do well to clean up glasses, plates, &c. which have been used for the evening meal, and prepare for her morning's work by placing her wood near the fire, on the hob, to dry, taking care there is no danger of it igniting, before she leaves the kitchen for the night.
10136-8{_}29295{_}Before retiring, she will have to lock and bolt the doors, unless the master undertakes this office himself.
10136-8{_}29296{_}2355.
10136-8{_}29297{_}If the washing, or even a portion of it, is done at home, it will be impossible for the maid-of-all-work to do her household duties thoroughly, during the time it is about, unless she have some assistance.
10136-8{_}29298{_}Usually, if all the washing is done at home, the mistress hires some one to assist at the wash-tub, and sees to little matters herself, in the way of dusting, clearing away breakfast things, folding, starching, and ironing the fine things.
10136-8{_}29299{_}With a little management much can be accomplished, provided the mistress be industrious, energetic, and willing to lend a helping hand.
10136-8{_}29300{_}Let washing-week be not the excuse for having everything in a muddle; and although "things" cannot be cleaned so thoroughly, and so much time spent upon them, as ordinarily, yet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great deal of exertion either on the part of the mistress or servant.
10136-8{_}29301{_}We will conclude our remarks with an extract from an admirably-written book, called "Home Truths for Home Peace."
10136-8{_}29302{_}The authoress says, with respect to the great wash--"Amongst all the occasions in which it is most difficult and glorious to keep muddle out of a family, 'the great wash' stands pre-eminent; and as very little money is now saved by having _everything_ done at home, many ladies, with the option of taking another servant or putting out the chief part of the washing, have thankfully adopted the latter course."
10136-8{_}29303{_}She goes on to say--"When a gentleman who dines at home can't bear washing in the house, but gladly pays for its being done elsewhere, the lady should gratefully submit to his wishes, and put out anything in her whole establishment rather than put out a good and generous husband."
10136-8{_}29304{_}2356.
10136-8{_}29305{_}A bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little needlework for herself, if she lives with consistent and reasonable people.
10136-8{_}29306{_}In the summer evenings she should manage to sit down for two or three hours, and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days.
10136-8{_}29307{_}A general servant's duties are so multifarious, that unless she be quick and active, she will not be able to accomplish this.
10136-8{_}29308{_}To discharge these various duties properly is a difficult task, and sometimes a thankless office; but it must be remembered that a good maid-of-all-work will make a good servant in any capacity, and may be safely taken not only without fear of failure, but with every probability of giving satisfaction to her employer.
10136-8{_}29309{_}DUTIES OF THE DAIRY-MAID.
10136-8{_}29310{_}2357.
10136-8{_}29311{_}The duties of the dairy-maid differ considerably in different districts.
10136-8{_}29312{_}In Scotland, Wales, and some of the northern counties, women milk the cows.
10136-8{_}29313{_}On some of the large dairy farms in other parts of England, she takes her share in the milking, but in private families the milking is generally performed by the cowkeeper, and the dairy-maid only receives the milkpails from him morning and night, and empties and cleans them preparatory to the next milking; her duty being to supply the family with milk, cream, and butter, and other luxuries depending on the "milky mothers" of the herd.
10136-8{_}29314{_}2358.
10136-8{_}29315{_}_The Dairy._--The object with which gentlemen keep cows is     to procure milk unadulterated, and sweet butter, for themselves     and families: in order to obtain this, however, great     cleanliness is required, and as visitors, as well as the     mistress of the house, sometimes visit the dairy, some efforts     are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque.
10136-8{_}29316{_}The     locality is usually fixed near to the house; it should neither     be exposed to the fierce heat of the summer's sun nor to the     equally unfavourable frosts of winter--it must be both sheltered     and shaded.
10136-8{_}29317{_}If it is a building apart from the house and other     offices, the walls should be tolerably thick, and if hollow, the     temperature will be more equable.
10136-8{_}29318{_}The walls inside are usually     covered with Dutch glazed tiles; the flooring also of glazed     tiles set in asphalte, to resist water; and the ceiling, lath     and plaster, or closely-jointed woodwork, painted.
10136-8{_}29319{_}Its     architecture will be a matter of fancy: it should have a     northern aspect, and a thatched roof is considered most     suitable, from the shade and shelter it affords; and it should     contain at least two apartments, besides a cool place for     storing away butter.
10136-8{_}29320{_}One of the apartments, in which the milk is     placed to deposit cream, or to ripen for churning, is usually     surrounded by shelves of marble or slate, on which the     milk-dishes rest; but it will be found a better plan to have a     large square or round table of stone in the centre, with a     water-tight ledge all round it, in which water may remain in hot     weather, or, if some attempt at the picturesque is desired, a     small fountain might occupy the centre, which would keep the     apartment cool and fresh.
10136-8{_}29321{_}Round this table the milk-dishes     should be ranged; one shelf, or dresser, of slate or marble,     being kept for the various occupations of the dairy-maid: it     will be found a better plan than putting them on shelves and     corners against the wall.
10136-8{_}29322{_}There should be a funnel or ventilator     in the ceiling, communicating with the open air, made to open     and shut as required.
10136-8{_}29323{_}Double windows are recommended, but of the     lattice kind, so that they may open, and with wire-gauze blinds     fitted into the opening, and calico blinds, which may be wetted     when additional coolness is required.
10136-8{_}29324{_}The other apartment will     be used for churning, washing, and scrubbing--in fact, the     scullery of the dairy, with a boiler for hot water, and a sink     with cold water laid on, which should be plentiful and good.
10136-8{_}29325{_}In     some dairies a third apartment, or, at least, a cool airy     pantry, is required for storing away butter, with shelves of     marble or slate, to hold the cream-jars while it is ripening;     and where cheeses are made, a fourth becomes necessary.
10136-8{_}29326{_}The     dairy utensils are not numerous,--_churns_, _milk-pails_ for     each cow, _hair-sieves_, _slices of tin_, milk-pans, marble     dishes for cream for family use, scales and weights, a portable     rack for drying the utensils, _wooden bowls_, butter-moulds and     butter-patters, and _wooden tubs_ for washing the utensils,     comprising pretty nearly everything.
10136-8{_}29327{_}2359.
10136-8{_}29328{_}_Pails_ are made of maple-wood or elm, and hooped, or of     tin, more or less ornamented.
10136-8{_}29329{_}One is required for each cow.
10136-8{_}29330{_}2360.
10136-8{_}29331{_}The _Hair-Sieve_ is made of closely-twisted horse-hair,     with a rim, through which the milk is strained to remove any     hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking.
10136-8{_}29332{_}2361.
10136-8{_}29333{_}_Milk-Dishes_ are shallow basins of glass, of glazed     earthenware, or tin, about 16 inches in diameter at top, and 12     at the bottom, and 5 or 6 inches deep, holding about 8 to 10     quarts each when full.
10136-8{_}29334{_}2362.
10136-8{_}29335{_}_Churns_ are of all sorts and sizes, from that which     churns 70 or 80 gallons by means of a strap from the engine, to     the square box in which a pound of butter is made.
10136-8{_}29336{_}The churn     used for families is a square box, 18 inches by 12 or 13, and 17     deep, bevelled below to the plane of the _dashers_, with a loose     lid or cover.
10136-8{_}29337{_}The dasher consists of an axis of wood, to which     the four beaters or fanners are attached; these fans are simply     four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together, forming an     oblong square, with a space left open, two of the openings being     left broader than the others; attached to an axle, they form an     axis with four projecting blades; the axle fits into supports at     the centre of the box; a handle is fitted to it, and the act of     churning is done by turning the handle.
10136-8{_}29338{_}2363.
10136-8{_}29339{_}Such is the temple in which the dairy-maid presides: it     should be removed both from stable and cowhouse, and larder; no     animal smells should come near it, and the drainage should be     perfect.
10136-8{_}29340{_}2364.
10136-8{_}29341{_}The dairy-maid receives the milk from the cowkeeper, each pail being strained through the hair-sieve into one of the milk-basins.
10136-8{_}29342{_}This is left in the basins from twenty-four to thirty-six hours in the summer, according to the weather; after which it is skimmed off by means of the slicer, and poured into glazed earthenware jars to "turn" for churning.
10136-8{_}29343{_}Some persons prefer making up a separate churning for the milk of each cow; in which there is some advantage.
10136-8{_}29344{_}In this case the basins of each cow, for two days, would either be kept together or labelled.
10136-8{_}29345{_}As soon as emptied, the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk washed out, and placed away in a dry place till next required; and all milk spilt on the floor, or on the table or dresser, cleaned up with a cloth and hot water.
10136-8{_}29346{_}Where very great attention is paid to the dairy, the milk-coolers are used larger in winter, when it is desirable to retard the cooling down and increase the creamy deposit, and smaller in summer, to hasten it; the temperature required being from 55° to 50°, In summer it is sometimes expedient, in very sultry weather, to keep the dairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime across the room.
10136-8{_}29347{_}2365.
10136-8{_}29348{_}In some dairies it is usual to churn twice, and in others three times a week: the former produces the best butter, the other the greatest quantity.
10136-8{_}29349{_}With three cows, the produce should be 27 to 30 quarts a day.
10136-8{_}29350{_}The dairy-maid should churn every day when very hot, if they are in full milk, and every second day in more temperate weather; besides supplying the milk and cream required for a large establishment.
10136-8{_}29351{_}The churning should always be done in the morning: the dairy-maid will find it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five o'clock.
10136-8{_}29352{_}The operation occupies from 20 minutes to half an hour in summer, and considerably longer in winter.
10136-8{_}29353{_}A steady uniform motion is necessary to produce sweet butter; neither too quick nor too slow.
10136-8{_}29354{_}Rapid motion causes the cream to heave and swell, from too much air being forced into it: the result is a tedious churning, and soft, bad-coloured butter.
10136-8{_}29355{_}2366.
10136-8{_}29356{_}In spring and summer, when the cow has her natural food, no artificial colour is required; but in winter, under stall-feeding, the colour is white and tallowy, and some persons prefer a higher colour.
10136-8{_}29357{_}This is communicated by mixing a little finely-powdered arnotto with the cream before putting it into the churn; a still more, natural and delicate colour is communicated by scraping a red carrot into a clean piece of linen cloth, dipping it into water, and squeezing it into the cream.
10136-8{_}29358{_}2367.
10136-8{_}29359{_}As soon as the butter comes, the milk is poured off, and the butter put into a shallow wooden tub or bowl, full of pure spring water, in which it is washed and kneaded, pouring off the water, and renewing it until it comes away perfectly free from milk.
10136-8{_}29360{_}Imperfect washing is the frequent cause of bad butter, and in nothing is the skill of the dairy-maid tested more than in this process; moreover, it is one in which cleanliness of habits and person are most necessary.
10136-8{_}29361{_}In this operation we want the aid of Phyllis's neat, soft, and perfectly clean hand; for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour particles of milk or curd.
10136-8{_}29362{_}2368.
10136-8{_}29363{_}The operations of churning and butter-making over, the butter-milk is disposed of: usually, in England, it goes to the pigs; but it is a, very wholesome beverage when fresh, and some persons like it; the disposal, therefore, will rest with the mistress: the dairy-maid's duty is to get rid of it.
10136-8{_}29364{_}She must then scald with boiling water and scrub out every utensil she has used; brush out the churn, clean out the cream-jars, which will probably require the use of a little common soda to purify; wipe all dry, and place them in a position where the sun can reach them for a short time, to sweeten them.
10136-8{_}29365{_}2369.
10136-8{_}29366{_}In Devonshire, celebrated for its dairy system, the milk     is always scalded.
10136-8{_}29367{_}The milk-pans, which are of tin, and contain     from 10 to 12 quarts, after standing 10 or 12 hours, are placed     on a hot plate of iron, over a stove, until the cream has formed     on the surface, which is indicated by the air-bubbles rising     through the milk, and producing blisters on the surface-coating     of cream.
10136-8{_}29368{_}This indicates its approach to the boiling point: and     the vessel is now removed to cool.
10136-8{_}29369{_}When sufficiently, that is,     quite cool, the cream is skimmed off with the slice: it is now     the clouted cream for which Devonshire is so famous.
10136-8{_}29370{_}It is now     placed in the churn, and churned until the butter comes, which     it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other     process.
10136-8{_}29371{_}The butter so made contains more _caseine_ than butter     made in the usual way, but does not keep so long.
10136-8{_}29372{_}2370.
10136-8{_}29373{_}It is a question frequently discussed, how far it is economical for families to keep cows and make their own butter.
10136-8{_}29374{_}It is calculated that a good cow costs from May 1 to October 1, when well but economically kept, £5.
10136-8{_}29375{_}16s.
10136-8{_}29376{_}6d; and from October 1 to April 30, £10.
10136-8{_}29377{_}2s.
10136-8{_}29378{_}6d.
10136-8{_}29379{_}During that time she should produce 227 lbs.
10136-8{_}29380{_}of butter, besides the skimmed milk.
10136-8{_}29381{_}Of course, if new milk and cream are required, that will diminish the quantity of butter.
10136-8{_}29382{_}2371.
10136-8{_}29383{_}Besides churning and keeping her dairy in order, the dairy-maid has charge of the whole produce, handing it over to the cook, butler, or housemaid as required; and she will do well to keep an exact account both of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it.
10136-8{_}29384{_}DUTIES OF THE LAUNDRY-MAID.
10136-8{_}29385{_}2372.
10136-8{_}29386{_}The laundry-maid is charged with the duty of washing and getting-up the family linen,--a situation of great importance where the washing is all done at home; but in large towns, where there is little convenience for bleaching and drying, it is chiefly done by professional laundresses and companies, who apply mechanical and chemical processes to the purpose.
10136-8{_}29387{_}These processes, however, are supposed to injure the fabric of the linen; and in many families the fine linen, cottons, and muslins, are washed and got-up at home, even where the bulk of the washing is given out.
10136-8{_}29388{_}In country and suburban houses, where greater conveniences exist, washing at home is more common,--in country places universal.
10136-8{_}29389{_}2373.
10136-8{_}29390{_}The laundry establishment consists of a washing-house, an ironing and drying-room, and sometimes a drying-closet heated by furnaces.
10136-8{_}29391{_}The washing-house will probably be attached to the kitchen; but it is better that it should be completely detached from it, and of one story, with a funnel or shaft to carry off the steam.
10136-8{_}29392{_}It will be of a size proportioned to the extent of the washing to be done.
10136-8{_}29393{_}A range of tubs, either round or oblong, opposite to, and sloping towards, the light, narrower at the bottom than the top, for convenience in stooping over, and fixed at a height suited to the convenience of the women using them; each tub having a tap for hot and cold water, and another in the bottom, communicating with the drains, for drawing off foul water.
10136-8{_}29394{_}A boiler and furnace, proportioned in size to the wants of the family, should also be fixed.
10136-8{_}29395{_}The flooring should be York stone, laid on brick piers, with good drainage, or asphalte, sloping gently towards a gutter connected with the drain.
10136-8{_}29396{_}2374.
10136-8{_}29397{_}Adjoining the bleaching-house, a second room, about the same size, is required for ironing, drying, and mangling.
10136-8{_}29398{_}The contents of this room should comprise an ironing-board, opposite to the light; a strong white deal table, about twelve or fourteen feet long, and about three and a half feet broad, with drawers for ironing-blankets; a mangle in one corner, and clothes-horses for drying and airing; cupboards for holding the various irons, starch, and other articles used in ironing; a hot-plate built in the chimney, with furnace beneath it for heating the irons; sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the room for drying.
10136-8{_}29399{_}Where this is the case, however, there should be a funnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying off steam; but a better arrangement is to have a hot-air closet adjoining, heated by hot-air pipes, and lined with iron, with proper arrangements for carrying off steam, and clothes-horses on castors running in grooves, to run into it for drying purposes.
10136-8{_}29400{_}This leaves the laundry free from unwholesome vapour.
10136-8{_}29401{_}2375.
10136-8{_}29402{_}The laundry-maid should commence her labours on Monday morning by a careful examination of the articles committed to her care, and enter them in the washing-book; separating the white linen and collars, sheets and body-linen, into one heap, fine muslins into another, coloured cotton and linen fabrics into a third, woollens into a fourth, and the coarser kitchen and other greasy cloths into a fifth.
10136-8{_}29403{_}Every article should be examined for ink- or grease-spots, or for fruit- or wine-stains.
10136-8{_}29404{_}Ink-spots are removed by dipping the part into hot water, and then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon, pouring a few drops of oxalic acid or salts of sorel over the ink-spot, rubbing and rinsing it in cold water till removed; grease-spots, by rubbing over with yellow soap, and rinsing in hot water; fruit- and wine-spots, by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine, and rinsing.
10136-8{_}29405{_}2376.
10136-8{_}29406{_}Every article having been examined and assorted, the sheets and fine linen should be placed in one of the tubs and just covered with lukewarm water, in which a little soda has been dissolved and mixed, and left there to soak till the morning.
10136-8{_}29407{_}The greasy cloths and dirtier things should be laid to soak in another tub, in a liquor composed of 1/2 lb.
10136-8{_}29408{_}of unslaked lime to every 6 quarts of water which has been boiled for two hours, then left to settle, and strained off when clear.
10136-8{_}29409{_}Each article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it thoroughly, and left to soak till the morning, just covered by it when the things are pressed together.
10136-8{_}29410{_}Coppers and boilers should now be filled, and the fires laid ready to light.
10136-8{_}29411{_}2377.
10136-8{_}29412{_}Early on the following morning the fires should be lighted, and as soon as hot water can be procured, washing commenced; the sheets and body-linen being wanted to whiten in the morning, should be taken first; each article being removed in succession from the lye in which it has been soaking, rinsed, rubbed, and wrung, and laid aside until the tub is empty, when the foul water is drawn off.
10136-8{_}29413{_}The tub should be again filled with luke-warm water, about 80°, in which the articles should again be plunged, and each gone over carefully with soap, and rubbed.
10136-8{_}29414{_}Novices in the art sometimes rub the linen against the skin; more experienced washerwomen rub one linen surface against the other, which saves their hands, and enables them to continue their labour much longer, besides economizing time, two parts being thus cleaned at once.
10136-8{_}29415{_}2378.
10136-8{_}29416{_}After this first washing, the linen should be put into a second water as hot as the hand can bear, and again rubbed over in every part, examining every part for spots not yet moved, which require to be again soaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean; then rinsed and wrung, the larger and stronger articles by two of the women; the smaller and more delicate articles requiring gentler treatment.
10136-8{_}29417{_}2379.
10136-8{_}29418{_}In order to remove every particle of soap, and produce a good colour, they should now be placed, and boiled for about an hour and a half in the copper, in which soda, in the proportion of a teaspoonful to every two gallons of water, has been dissolved.
10136-8{_}29419{_}Some very careful laundresses put the linen into a canvas bag to protect it from the scum and the sides of the copper.
10136-8{_}29420{_}When taken out, it should again be rinsed, first in clean hot water, and then in abundance of cold water slightly tinged with fig-blue, and again wrung dry.
10136-8{_}29421{_}It should now be removed from the washing-house and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach, if there are conveniences for it; and the earlier in the day this is done, the clearer and whiter will be the linen.
10136-8{_}29422{_}2380.
10136-8{_}29423{_}Coloured muslins, cottons, and linens, require a milder treatment; any application of soda will discharge the colour, and soaking all night, even in pure water, deteriorates the more delicate tints.
10136-8{_}29424{_}When ready for washing, if not too dirty, they should be put into cold water and washed very speedily, using the common yellow soap, which should be rinsed off immediately.
10136-8{_}29425{_}One article should be washed at a time, and rinsed out immediately before any others are wetted.
10136-8{_}29426{_}When washed thoroughly, they should be rinsed in succession in soft water, in which common salt has been dissolved, in the proportion of a handful to three or four gallons, and afterwards wrung gently, as soon as rinsed, with as little twisting as possible, and then hung out to dry.
10136-8{_}29427{_}Delicate-coloured articles should not be exposed to the sun, but dried in the shade, using clean lines and wooden pegs.
10136-8{_}29428{_}2381.
10136-8{_}29429{_}Woollen articles are liable to shrink, unless the flannel has been well shrunk before making up.
10136-8{_}29430{_}This liability is increased where very hot water is used: cold water would thus be the best to wash woollens in; but, as this would not remove the dirt, lukewarm water, about 85°, and yellow soap, are recommended.
10136-8{_}29431{_}When thoroughly washed in this, they require a good deal of rinsing in cold water, to remove the soap.
10136-8{_}29432{_}2382.
10136-8{_}29433{_}Greasy cloths, which have soaked all night in the liquid described, should be now washed out with soap-and-water as hot as the hands can bear, first in one water, and rinsed out in a second; and afterwards boiled for two hours in water in which a little soda is dissolved.
10136-8{_}29434{_}When taken out, they should be rinsed in cold water, and laid out or hung up to dry.
10136-8{_}29435{_}2383.
10136-8{_}29436{_}Silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone.
10136-8{_}29437{_}When they contain snuff, they should be soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or three hours; they should be rinsed out and put to soak with the others in cold water for an hour or two; then washed in lukewarm water, being soaped as they are washed.
10136-8{_}29438{_}If this does not remove all stains, they should be washed a second time in similar water, and, when finished, rinsed in soft water in which a handful of common salt has been dissolved.
10136-8{_}29439{_}In washing stuff or woollen dresses, the band at the waist and the lining at the bottom should be removed, and wherever it is gathered into folds; and, in furniture, the hems and gatherings.
10136-8{_}29440{_}A black silk dress, if very dirty, must be washed; but, if only soiled, soaking for four-and-twenty hours will do; if old and rusty, a pint of common spirits should be mixed with each gallon of water, which is an improvement under any circumstances.
10136-8{_}29441{_}Whether soaked or washed, it should be hung up to drain, and dried without wringing.
10136-8{_}29442{_}2384.
10136-8{_}29443{_}Satin and silk ribbons, both white and coloured, may be cleaned in the same manner.
10136-8{_}29444{_}2385.
10136-8{_}29445{_}Silks, when washed, should be dried in the shade, on a linen-horse, taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled.
10136-8{_}29446{_}If black or blue, they will be improved if laid again on the table, when dry, and sponged with gin, or whiskey, or other white spirit.
10136-8{_}29447{_}2386.
10136-8{_}29448{_}The operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs, cleaning the coppers, scrubbing the floors of the washing-house, and restoring everything to order and cleanliness.
10136-8{_}29449{_}2387.
10136-8{_}29450{_}Thursday and Friday, in a laundry in full employ, are usually devoted to mangling, starching, and ironing.
10136-8{_}29451{_}2388.
10136-8{_}29452{_}Linen, cotton, and other fabrics, after being washed and dried, are made smooth and glossy by mangling and by ironing.
10136-8{_}29453{_}The mangling process, which is simply passing them between rollers subjected to a very considerable pressure, produced by weight, is confined to sheets, towels, table-linen, and similar articles, which are without folds or plaits.
10136-8{_}29454{_}Ironing is necessary to smooth body-linen, and made-up articles of delicate texture or gathered into folds.
10136-8{_}29455{_}The mangle is too well known to need description.
10136-8{_}29456{_}2389.
10136-8{_}29457{_}_Ironing_.--The irons consist of the common flat-iron,     which is of different sizes, varying from 4 to 10 inches in     length, triangular in form, and from 2-1/2 to 4-1/2 inches in     width at the broad end; the oval iron, which is used for more     delicate articles; and the box-iron, which is hollow, and heated     by a red-hot iron inserted into the box.
10136-8{_}29458{_}The Italian iron is a     hollow tube, smooth on the outside, and raised on a slender     pedestal with a footstalk.
10136-8{_}29459{_}Into the hollow cylinder a red-hot     iron is pushed, which heats it; and the smooth outside of the     latter is used, on which articles such as frills, and plaited     articles, are drawn.
10136-8{_}29460{_}Crimping- and gauffering-machines are used     for a kind of plaiting where much regularity is required, the     articles being passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to     represent the kind of plait or fold required.
10136-8{_}29461{_}2390.
10136-8{_}29462{_}Starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to certain parts of linen, as the collar and front of shirts, by dipping them in a paste made of starch boiled in water, mixed with a little gum Arabic, where extra stiffness is required.
10136-8{_}29463{_}TO MAKE STARCH.
10136-8{_}29464{_}2391.
10136-8{_}29465{_}INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling water to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch.
10136-8{_}29466{_}_Mode_.--Put the starch into a tolerably large basin; pour over it the cold water, and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps, and quite smooth.
10136-8{_}29467{_}Then take the basin to the fire, and whilst the water is _actually boiling_ in the kettle or boiler, pour it over the starch, stirring it the whole time.
10136-8{_}29468{_}If made properly in this manner, the starch will require no further boiling; but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch, it will not thicken, and must be put into a clean saucepan, and stirred over the fire until it boils.
10136-8{_}29469{_}Take it off the fire, strain it into a clean basin, cover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top, and, when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it, starch the things.
10136-8{_}29470{_}Many persons, to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed, stir round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle, which also prevents the iron from sticking.
10136-8{_}29471{_}2392.
10136-8{_}29472{_}When the "things to be starched" are washed, dried, and taken off the lines, they should be dipped into the hot starch made as directed, squeezed out of it, and then just dipped into cold water, and immediately squeezed dry.
10136-8{_}29473{_}If fine things be wrung, or roughly used, they are very liable to tear; so too much care cannot be exercised in this respect.
10136-8{_}29474{_}If the article is lace, clap it between the hands a few times, which will assist to clear it; then have ready laid out on the table a large clean towel or cloth; shake out the starched things, lay them on the cloth, and roll it up tightly, and let it remain for three or fours, when the things will be ready to iron.
10136-8{_}29475{_}2393.
10136-8{_}29476{_}To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience.
10136-8{_}29477{_}Strict cleanliness with all the ironing utensils must be observed, as, if this is not the case, not the most expert ironer will be able to make her things look clear and free from smears, &c. After wiping down her ironing table, the laundry-maid should place a coarse cloth on it, and over that the ironing-blanket, with her stand and iron-rubber; and having ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of the right heat, she proceeds with her work.
10136-8{_}29478{_}2394.
10136-8{_}29479{_}It is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or apron before ironing anything fine: there is then no danger of scorching.
10136-8{_}29480{_}For ironing fine things, such as collars, cuffs, muslins, and laces, there is nothing so clean and nice to use as the box-iron; the bottom being bright, and never placed near the fire, it is always perfectly clean; it should, however, be kept in a dry place, for fear of its rusting.
10136-8{_}29481{_}Gauffering-tongs or irons must be placed in a clear fire for a minute, then withdrawn, wiped with a coarse rubber, and the heat of them tried on a piece of paper, as, unless great care is taken, these will very soon scorch.
10136-8{_}29482{_}2395.
10136-8{_}29483{_}The skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirt-board covered with flannel, and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board, also covered with flannel; this board being placed between the back and front.
10136-8{_}29484{_}2396.
10136-8{_}29485{_}After things are mangled, they should also be ironed in the folds and gathers; dinner-napkins smoothed over, as also table-cloths, pillow-cases, and sometimes sheets.
10136-8{_}29486{_}The bands of flannel petticoats, and shoulder-straps to flannel waistcoats, must also undergo the same process.
10136-8{_}29487{_}UPPER AND UNDER NURSEMAIDS.
10136-8{_}29488{_}2397.
10136-8{_}29489{_}The nursery is of great importance in every family, and in families of distinction, where there are several young children, it is an establishment kept apart from the rest of the family, under the charge of an upper nurse, assisted by under nursery-maids proportioned to the work to be done.
10136-8{_}29490{_}The responsible duties of upper nursemaid commence with the weaning of the child: it must now be separated from the mother or wet-nurse, at least for a time, and the cares of the nursemaid, which have hitherto been only occasionally put in requisition, are now to be entirely devoted to the infant.
10136-8{_}29491{_}She washes, dresses, and feeds it; walks out with it, and regulates all its little wants; and, even at this early age, many good qualities are required to do so in a satisfactory manner.
10136-8{_}29492{_}Patience and good temper are indispensable qualities; truthfulness, purity of manners, minute cleanliness, and docility and obedience, almost equally so.
10136-8{_}29493{_}She ought also to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps, and be handy with her needle.
10136-8{_}29494{_}2398.
10136-8{_}29495{_}There is a considerable art in carrying an infant     comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid.
10136-8{_}29496{_}If she carry it     always seated upright on her arm, and presses it too closely     against her chest, the stomach of the child is apt to get     compressed, and the back fatigued.
10136-8{_}29497{_}For her own comfort, a good     nurse will frequently vary this position, by changing from one     arm to the other, and sometimes by laying it across both,     raising the head a little.
10136-8{_}29498{_}When teaching it to walk, and guiding     it by the hand, she should change the hand from time to time, so     as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other.
10136-8{_}29499{_}This is     the only way in which a child should be taught to walk;     leading-strings and other foolish inventions, which force an     infant to make efforts, with its shoulders and head forward,     before it knows how to use its limbs, will only render it     feeble, and retard its progress.
10136-8{_}29500{_}2399.
10136-8{_}29501{_}Most children have some bad habit, of which they must be     broken; but this is never accomplished by harshness without     developing worse evils: kindness, perseverance, and patience in     the nurse, are here of the utmost importance.
10136-8{_}29502{_}When     finger-sucking is one of these habits, the fingers are sometimes     rubbed with bitter aloes, or some equally disagreeable     substance.
10136-8{_}29503{_}Others have dirty habits, which are only to be     changed by patience, perseverance, and, above all, by regularity     in the nurse.
10136-8{_}29504{_}She should never be permitted to inflict     punishment on these occasions, or, indeed, on any occasion.
10136-8{_}29505{_}But,     if punishment is to be avoided, it is still more necessary that     all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden.
10136-8{_}29506{_}Yielding to all the whims of a child,--picking up its toys when     thrown away in mere wantonness, would be intolerable.
10136-8{_}29507{_}A child     should never be led to think others inferior to it, to beat a     dog, or even the stone against which it falls, as some children     are taught to do by silly nurses.
10136-8{_}29508{_}Neither should the nurse     affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents which must     inevitably happen: if it falls, treat it as a trifle; otherwise     she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity.
10136-8{_}29509{_}But she will     take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence, or     the result of neglect.
10136-8{_}29510{_}2400.
10136-8{_}29511{_}The nurse should keep the child as clean as possible, and     particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness, so     that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise; watching     especially that it does not soil itself in eating.
10136-8{_}29512{_}At the same     time, vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged     by over-care in this respect, or by too tight lacing or     buttoning of dresses, nor a small foot cultivated by the use of     tight shoes.
10136-8{_}29513{_}2401.
10136-8{_}29514{_}Nursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents     faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the     dispositions of very young children.
10136-8{_}29515{_}If properly checked in     time, evil propensities may be eradicated; but this should not     extend to anything but serious defects; otherwise, the intuitive     perceptions which all children possess will construe the act     into "spying" and "informing," which should never be resorted to     in the case of children, nor, indeed, in any case.
10136-8{_}29516{_}2402.
10136-8{_}29517{_}Such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid, and it is her duty to fulfil them personally.
10136-8{_}29518{_}In large establishments she will have assistants proportioned to the number of children of which she has the care.
10136-8{_}29519{_}The under nursemaid lights the fires, sweeps, scours, and dusts the rooms, and makes the beds; empties slops, and carries up water; brings up and removes the nursery meals; washes and dresses all the children, except the infant, and assists in mending.
10136-8{_}29520{_}Where there is a nursery girl to assist, she does the rougher part of the cleaning; and all take their meals in the nursery together, after the children of the family have done.
10136-8{_}29521{_}2403.
10136-8{_}29522{_}In smaller families, where there is only one nursemaid kept, she is assisted by the housemaid, or servant-of-all-work, who will do the rougher part of the work, and carry up the nursery meals.
10136-8{_}29523{_}In such circumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her mistress, who will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the infant.
10136-8{_}29524{_}In higher families, the upper nurse is usually permitted to sup or dine occasionally at the housekeeper's table by way of relaxation, when the children are all well, and her subordinates trustworthy.
10136-8{_}29525{_}2404.
10136-8{_}29526{_}Where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery, and the mother is too much occupied to do more than pay a daily visit to it, it is desirable that she be a person of observation, and possess some acquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood, as also with such simple remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be procured, or where such attendance is not considered necessary.
10136-8{_}29527{_}All these little ailments are preceded by symptoms so minute as to be only perceptible to close observation; such as twitching of the brows, restless sleep, grinding the gums, and, in some inflammatory diseases, even to the child abstaining from crying, from fear of the increased pain produced by the movement.
10136-8{_}29528{_}Dentition, or cutting the teeth, is attended with many of these symptoms.
10136-8{_}29529{_}Measles, thrush, scarlatina, croup, hooping-cough, and other childish complaints, are all preceded by well-known symptoms, which may be alleviated and rendered less virulent by simple remedies instantaneously applied.
10136-8{_}29530{_}2405.
10136-8{_}29531{_}_Dentition_ is usually the first serious trouble, bringing many other disorders in its train.
10136-8{_}29532{_}The symptoms are most perceptible to the mother: the child sucks feebly, and with gums hot, inflamed, and swollen.
10136-8{_}29533{_}In this case, relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time with a little of Mrs. Johnson's soothing syrup, a valuable and perfectly safe medicine.
10136-8{_}29534{_}Selfish and thoughtless nurses, and mothers too, sometimes give cordials and sleeping-draughts, whose effects are too well known.
10136-8{_}29535{_}2406.
10136-8{_}29536{_}_Convulsion Fits_ sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced by these causes; in which case a hot bath should be administered without delay, and the lower parts of the body rubbed, the bath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin; at the same time, the doctor should be sent for immediately, for no nurse should administer medicine in this case, unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act.
10136-8{_}29537{_}2407.
10136-8{_}29538{_}_Croup_ is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood; it is accompanied with a hoarse, croaking, ringing cough, and comes on very suddenly, and most so in strong, robust children.
10136-8{_}29539{_}A very hot bath should be instantly administered, followed by an emetic, either in the form of tartar-emetic, croup-powder, or a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha, wrapping the body warmly up in flannel after the bath.
10136-8{_}29540{_}The slightest delay in administering the bath, or the emetic, may be fatal; hence, the importance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the symptoms.
10136-8{_}29541{_}2408.
10136-8{_}29542{_}_Hooping-Cough_ is generally preceded by the moaning noise during sleep, which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid: it is followed by violent fits of coughing, which little can be done to relieve.
10136-8{_}29543{_}A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as possible in the fresh, pure air, but out of draughts, and kept warm, and supplied with plenty of nourishing food.
10136-8{_}29544{_}Many fatal diseases flow from this scourge of childhood, and a change to purer air, if possible, should follow convalescence.
10136-8{_}29545{_}2409.
10136-8{_}29546{_}_Worms_ are the torment of some children: the symptoms are, an unnatural craving for food, even after a full meal; costiveness, suddenly followed by the reverse; fetid breath, a livid circle under the eyes, enlarged abdomen, and picking the nose; for which the remedies must be prescribed by the doctor.
10136-8{_}29547{_}2410.
10136-8{_}29548{_}_Measles_ and _Scarlatina_ much resemble each other in their early stages: headache, restlessness, and fretfulness are the symptoms of both.
10136-8{_}29549{_}Shivering fits, succeeded by a hot skin; pains in the back and limbs, accompanied by sickness, and, in severe cases, sore throat; pain about the jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, which become red and inflamed, while the face is hot and flushed, often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever, of which it is only a mild form.
10136-8{_}29550{_}2411.
10136-8{_}29551{_}While the case is doubtful, a dessert-spoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water, given at bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle perspiration, and will bring out the rash in either case.
10136-8{_}29552{_}In measles, this appears first on the face; in scarlatina, on the chest; and in both cases a doctor should be called in.
10136-8{_}29553{_}In scarlatina, tartar-emetic powder or ipecacuanha may be administered in the mean time.
10136-8{_}29554{_}2412.
10136-8{_}29555{_}In all cases, cleanliness, fresh air, clean utensils, and frequent washing of the person, both of nurse and children, are even more necessary in the nursery than in either drawing-room or sick-room, inasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of injury from smells and vapours than adults.
10136-8{_}29556{_}2413.
10136-8{_}29557{_}It may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the duties of a nursemaid, by an extract from Florence Nightingale's admirable "Notes on Nursing."
10136-8{_}29558{_}Referring to children, she says:--      2414.
10136-8{_}29559{_}"They are much more susceptible than grown people to all     noxious influences.
10136-8{_}29560{_}They are affected by the same things, but     much more quickly and seriously; by want of fresh air, of proper     warmth; want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body;     by improper food, want of punctuality, by dulness, by want of     light, by too much or too little covering in bed or when up."
10136-8{_}29561{_}And all this in health; and then she quotes a passage from a     lecture on sudden deaths in infancy, to show the importance of     careful nursing of children:--"In the great majority of     instances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young     child, it is an _accident_; it is not a necessary, inevitable     result of any disease.
10136-8{_}29562{_}That which is known to injure children     most seriously is foul air; keeping the rooms where they sleep     closely shut up is destruction to them; and, if the child's     breathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such     foul air may endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is     felt by grown-up persons in the room."
10136-8{_}29563{_}2415.
10136-8{_}29564{_}Persons moving in the beat society will see, after     perusing Miss Nightingale's book, that this "foul air," "want of     light," "too much or too little clothing," and improper food, is     not confined to Crown Street or St. Giles's; that Belgravia and     the squares have their north room, where the rays of the sun     never reach.
10136-8{_}29565{_}"A wooden bedstead, two or three mattresses piled     up to above the height of the table, a vallance attached to the     frame,--nothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air     such a bed and bedding,"--is the ordinary bed of a private     house, than which nothing can be more unwholesome.
10136-8{_}29566{_}"Don't treat     your children like sick," she sums up; "don't dose them with     tea.
10136-8{_}29567{_}Let them eat meat and drink milk, or half a glass of light     beer.
10136-8{_}29568{_}Give them fresh, light, sunny, and open rooms, cool     bedrooms, plenty of outdoor exercise, facing even the cold, and     wind, and weather, in sufficiently warm clothes, and with     sufficient exercise, plenty of amusements and play; more     liberty, and less schooling, and cramming, and training; more     attention to food and less to physic."
10136-8{_}29569{_}DUTIES OF THE SICK-NURSE.
10136-8{_}29570{_}2416.
10136-8{_}29571{_}All women are likely, at some period of their lives, to be called on to perform the duties of a sick-nurse, and should prepare themselves as much as possible, by observation and reading, for the occasion when they may be required to perform the office.
10136-8{_}29572{_}The main requirements are good temper, compassion for suffering, sympathy with sufferers, which most women worthy of the name possess, neat-handedness, quiet manners, love of order, and cleanliness.
10136-8{_}29573{_}With these qualifications there will be very little to be wished for; the desire to relieve suffering will inspire a thousand little attentions, and surmount the disgusts which some of the offices attending the sick-room are apt to create.
10136-8{_}29574{_}Where serious illness visits a household, and protracted nursing is likely to become necessary, a professional nurse will probably be engaged, who has been trained to its duties; but in some families, and those not a few let us hope, the ladies of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure of duty on their part.
10136-8{_}29575{_}There is, besides, even when a professional nurse is ultimately called in, a period of doubt and hesitation, while disease has not yet developed itself, when the patient must be attended to; and, in these cases, some of the female servants of the establishment must give their attendance in the sick-room.
10136-8{_}29576{_}There are, also, slight attacks of cold, influenza, and accidents in a thousand forms, to which all are subject, where domestic nursing becomes a necessity; where disease, though unattended with danger, is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness, and when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary.
10136-8{_}29577{_}2417.
10136-8{_}29578{_}In the first stage of sickness, while doubt and a little perplexity hang over the household as to the nature of the sickness, there are some things about which no doubt can exist: the patient's room must be kept in a perfectly pure state, and arrangements made for proper attendance; for the first canon of nursing, according to Florence Nightingale, its apostle, is to "keep the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air, without chilling him."
10136-8{_}29579{_}This can be done without any preparation which might alarm the patient; with proper windows, open fireplaces, and a supply of fuel, the room may be as fresh as it is outside, and kept at a temperature suitable for the patient's state.
10136-8{_}29580{_}2418.
10136-8{_}29581{_}Windows, however, must be opened from above, and not from below, and draughts avoided; cool air admitted beneath the patient's head chills the lower strata and the floor.
10136-8{_}29582{_}The careful nurse will keep the door shut when the window is open; she will also take care that the patient is not placed between the door and the open window, nor between the open fireplace and the window.
10136-8{_}29583{_}If confined to bed, she will see that the bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated part of the room, but out of the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening of doors, as well as out of the line of draught between the window and the open chimney, and that the temperature of the room is kept about 64°.
10136-8{_}29584{_}Where it is necessary to admit air by the door, the windows should be closed; but there are few circumstances in which good air can be obtained through the chamber-door; through it, on the contrary, the gases generated in the lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn into the invalid chamber.
10136-8{_}29585{_}2419.
10136-8{_}29586{_}These precautions taken, and plain nourishing diet, such as the patient desires, furnished, probably little more can be done, unless more serious symptoms present themselves; in which case medical advice will be sought.
10136-8{_}29587{_}2420.
10136-8{_}29588{_}Under no circumstances is ventilation of the sick-room so essential as in cases of febrile diseases, usually considered infectious; such as typhus and puerperal fevers, influenza, hooping-cough, small- and chicken-pox, scarlet fever, measles, and erysipelas: all these are considered communicable through the air; but there is little danger of infection being thus communicated, provided the room is kept thoroughly ventilated.
10136-8{_}29589{_}On the contrary, if this essential be neglected, the power of infection is greatly increased and concentrated in the confined and impure air; it settles upon the clothes of the attendants and visitors, especially where they are of wool, and is frequently communicated to other families in this manner.
10136-8{_}29590{_}2421.
10136-8{_}29591{_}Under all circumstances, therefore, the sick-room should be kept as fresh and sweet as the open air, while the temperature is kept up by artificial heat, taking care that the fire burns clear, and gives out no smoke into the room; that the room is perfectly clean, wiped over with a damp cloth every day, if boarded; and swept, after sprinkling with damp tea-leaves, or other aromatic leaves, if carpeted; that all utensils are emptied and cleaned as soon as used, and not once in four-and-twenty hours, as is sometimes done.
10136-8{_}29592{_}"A slop-pail," Miss Nightingale says, "should never enter a sick-room; everything should be carried direct to the water-closet, emptied there, and brought up clean; in the best hospitals the slop-pail is unknown."
10136-8{_}29593{_}"I do not approve," says Miss Nightingale, "of making housemaids of nurses,--that would be waste of means; but I have seen surgical sisters, women whose hands were worth to them two or three guineas a week, down on their knees, scouring a room or hut, because they thought it was not fit for their patients: these women had the true nurse spirit."
10136-8{_}29594{_}2422.
10136-8{_}29595{_}Bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of lime on the floor; fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common expedient for the purification of the sick-room.
10136-8{_}29596{_}They are useful, but only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer, who commenced his lecture thus:--"Fumigations, gentlemen, are of essential importance; they make so abominable a smell, that they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh air."
10136-8{_}29597{_}In this sense they are useful, but ineffectual unless the cause be removed, and fresh air admitted.
10136-8{_}29598{_}2423.
10136-8{_}29599{_}The sick-room should be quiet; no talking, no gossiping, and, above all, no whispering,--this is absolute cruelty to the patient; he thinks his complaint the subject, and strains his ear painfully to catch the sound.
10136-8{_}29600{_}No rustling of dresses, nor creaking shoes either; where the carpets are taken up, the nurse should wear list shoes, or some other noiseless material, and her dress should be of soft material that does not rustle.
10136-8{_}29601{_}Miss Nightingale denounces crinoline, and quotes Lord Melbourne on the subject of women in the sick-room, who said, "I would rather have men about me, when ill, than women; it requires very strong health to put up with women."
10136-8{_}29602{_}Ungrateful man!
10136-8{_}29603{_}but absolute quiet is necessary in the sick-room.
10136-8{_}29604{_}2424.
10136-8{_}29605{_}Never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep by noise, never roused by anything like a surprise.
10136-8{_}29606{_}Always sit in the apartment, so that the patient has you in view, and that it is not necessary for him to turn in speaking to you.
10136-8{_}29607{_}Never keep a patient standing; never speak to one while moving.
10136-8{_}29608{_}Never lean on the sick-bed.
10136-8{_}29609{_}Above all, be calm and decisive with the patient, and prevent all noises over-head.
10136-8{_}29610{_}2425.
10136-8{_}29611{_}A careful nurse, when a patient leaves his bed, will open the sheets wide, and throw the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed; She will avoid drying or airing anything damp in the sick-room.
10136-8{_}29612{_}2426.
10136-8{_}29613{_}"It is another fallacy," says Florence Nightingale, "to suppose that night air is injurious; a great authority told me that, in London, the air is never so good as after ten o'clock, when smoke has diminished; but then it must be air from without, not within, and not air vitiated by gaseous airs."
10136-8{_}29614{_}"A great fallacy prevails also," she says, in another section, "about flowers poisoning the air of the sick-room: no one ever saw them over-crowding the sick-room; but, if they did, they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen."
10136-8{_}29615{_}Cut flowers also decompose water, and produce oxygen gas.
10136-8{_}29616{_}Lilies, and some other very odorous plants, may perhaps give out smells unsuited to a close room, while the atmosphere of the sick-room should always be fresh and natural.
10136-8{_}29617{_}2427.
10136-8{_}29618{_}"Patients," says Miss Nightingale, "are sometimes starved in the midst of plenty, from want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food.
10136-8{_}29619{_}A spoonful of beef-tea, or arrowroot and wine, or some other light nourishing diet, should be given every hour, for the patient's stomach will reject large supplies.
10136-8{_}29620{_}In very weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty in swallowing, which is much increased if food is not ready and presented at the moment when it is wanted: the nurse should be able to discriminate, and know when this moment is approaching."
10136-8{_}29621{_}2428.
10136-8{_}29622{_}Diet suitable for patients will depend, in some degree, on their natural likes and dislikes, which the nurse will do well to acquaint herself with.
10136-8{_}29623{_}Beef-tea is useful and relishing, but possesses little nourishment; when evaporated, it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to a pint of water.
10136-8{_}29624{_}Eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat.
10136-8{_}29625{_}Arrowroot is less nourishing than flour.
10136-8{_}29626{_}Butter is the lightest and most digestible kind of fat.
10136-8{_}29627{_}Cream, in some diseases, cannot be replaced.
10136-8{_}29628{_}But, to sum up with some of Miss Nightingale's useful maxims:--Observation is the nurse's best guide, and the patient's appetite the rule.
10136-8{_}29629{_}Half a pint of milk is equal to a quarter of a pound of meat.
10136-8{_}29630{_}Beef-tea is the least nourishing food administered to the sick; and tea and coffee, she thinks, are both too much excluded from the sick-room.
10136-8{_}29631{_}THE MONTHLY NURSE.
10136-8{_}29632{_}2429.
10136-8{_}29633{_}The choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance; and in the case of a young mother with her first child, it would be well for her to seek advice and counsel from her more experienced relatives in this matter.
10136-8{_}29634{_}In the first place, the engaging a monthly nurse in good time is of the utmost importance, as, if she be competent and clever, her services will be sought months beforehand; a good nurse having seldom much of her time disengaged.
10136-8{_}29635{_}There are some qualifications which it is evident the nurse should possess: she should be scrupulously clean and tidy in her person; honest, sober, and noiseless in her movements; should possess a natural love for children, and have a strong nerve in case of emergencies.
10136-8{_}29636{_}Snuff-taking and spirit-drinking must not be included in her habits; but these are happily much less frequent than they were in former days.
10136-8{_}29637{_}2430.
10136-8{_}29638{_}Receiving, as she often will, instructions from the doctor, she should bear these in mind, and carefully carry them out.
10136-8{_}29639{_}In those instances where she does not feel herself sufficiently informed, she should ask advice from the medical man, and not take upon herself to administer medicines, &c., without his knowledge.
10136-8{_}29640{_}2431.
10136-8{_}29641{_}A monthly nurse should be between 30 and 50 years of age, sufficiently old to have had a little experience, and yet not too old or infirm to be able to perform various duties requiring strength and bodily vigour.
10136-8{_}29642{_}She should be able to wake the moment she is called,--at any hour of the night, that the mother or child may have their wants immediately attended to.
10136-8{_}29643{_}Good temper, united to a kind and gentle disposition, is indispensable; and, although the nurse will frequently have much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid, she should make allowances for these, and command her temper, at the same time exerting her authority when it is necessary.
10136-8{_}29644{_}2432.
10136-8{_}29645{_}What the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her lady's room, depends entirely on the establishment that is kept.
10136-8{_}29646{_}Where there are plenty of servants, the nurse, of course, has nothing whatever to do but attend on her patient, and ring the bell for anything she may require.
10136-8{_}29647{_}Where the number of domestics is limited, she should not mind keeping her room in order; that is to say, sweeping and dusting it every morning.
10136-8{_}29648{_}If fires be necessary, the housemaid should always clean the grate, and do all that is wanted in that way, as this, being rather dirty work, would soil the nurse's dress, and unfit her to approach the bed, or take the infant without soiling its clothes.
10136-8{_}29649{_}In small establishments, too, the nurse should herself fetch things she may require, and not ring every time she wants anything; and she must, of course, not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable; and then only for a few minutes.
10136-8{_}29650{_}When down stairs, and in company with the other servants, the nurse should not repeat what she may have heard in her lady's room, as much mischief may be done by a gossiping nurse.
10136-8{_}29651{_}As in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days before her services may be required, she should see that all is in readiness; that there be no bustle and hurry at the time the confinement takes place.
10136-8{_}29652{_}She should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired, as well as night-dresses, flannels, &c. &c. All the things which will be required to dress the baby the first time should be laid in the basket in readiness, in the order in which they are to be put on; as well as scissors, thread, a few pieces of soft linen rag, and two or three flannel squares.
10136-8{_}29653{_}If a berceaunette is to be used immediately, the nurse should ascertain that the mattresses, pillow, &c. are all well aired; and if not already done before she arrives, she should assist in covering and trimming it, ready for the little occupant.
10136-8{_}29654{_}A monthly nurse should be handy at her needle, as, if she is in the house some time before the baby is born, she will require some work of this sort; to occupy her time.
10136-8{_}29655{_}She should also understand the making-up of little caps, although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurse's duties.
10136-8{_}29656{_}As most children wear no caps, except out of doors, her powers in this way will not be much taxed.
10136-8{_}29657{_}2433.
10136-8{_}29658{_}A nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible, and always keep it clean and tidy.
10136-8{_}29659{_}She should empty the chamber utensils as soon as used, and on no account put things under the bed.
10136-8{_}29660{_}Soiled baby's napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan, when they should be washed out every morning, and hung out to dry: they are then in a fit state to send to the laundress; and should, on no account, be left dirty, but done every morning in this way.
10136-8{_}29661{_}The bedroom should be kept rather dark, particularly for the first week or ten days; of a regular temperature, and as free as possible from draughts, at the same time well ventilated and free from unpleasant smells.
10136-8{_}29662{_}2434.
10136-8{_}29663{_}The infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light, or much air; and in carrying it about the passages, stairs, &c., the nurse should always have its head-flannel on, to protect the eyes and ears from the currents of air.
10136-8{_}29664{_}For the management of children, we must refer our readers to the following chapters; and we need only say, in conclusion, that a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various ills incident to this period, as, in all cases, prevention is better than cure.
10136-8{_}29665{_}As young mothers with their first baby are very often much troubled at first with their breasts, the nurse should understand the art of emptying them by suction, or some other contrivance.
10136-8{_}29666{_}If the breasts are kept well drawn, there will be but little danger of inflammation; and as the infant at first cannot take all that is necessary, something must be done to keep the inflammation down.
10136-8{_}29667{_}This is one of the greatest difficulties a nurse has to contend with, and we can only advise her to be very persevering, to rub the breasts well, and to let the infant suck as soon and as often as possible, until they get in proper order.
10136-8{_}29668{_}THE WET-NURSE.
10136-8{_}29669{_}2435.
10136-8{_}29670{_}We are aware that, according to the opinion of some ladies, there is no domestic theme, during a certain period of their married lives, more fraught with vexation and disquietude than that ever-fruitful source of annoyance, "the Nurse;" but, as we believe, there are thousands of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without even a temporary embroglio in the kitchen, or suffering a state of moral hectic the whole time of a nurse's empire in the nursery or bedroom.
10136-8{_}29671{_}Our own experience goes to prove, that although many unqualified persons palm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so rashly and dishonestly undertake to perform, and thus expose themselves to ill-will and merited censure, there are still very many fully equal to the legitimate exercise of what they undertake; and if they do not in every case give entire satisfaction, some of the fault,--and sometimes a great deal of it,--may be honestly placed to the account of the ladies themselves, who, in many instances, are so impressed with the propriety of their own method of performing everything, as to insist upon the adoption of _their_ system in preference to that of the nurse, whose plan is probably based on a comprehensive forethought, and rendered perfect in all its details by an ample experience.
10136-8{_}29672{_}2436.
10136-8{_}29673{_}In all our remarks on this subject, we should remember with gentleness the order of society from which our nurses are drawn; and that those who make their duty a study, and are termed professional nurses, have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their employers; while others are driven to the occupation from the laudable motive of feeding their own children, and who, in fulfilling that object, are too often both selfish and sensual, performing, without further interest than is consistent with their own advantage, the routine of customary duties.
10136-8{_}29674{_}2437.
10136-8{_}29675{_}Properly speaking, there are two nurses,--the nurse for the mother and the nurse for the child, or, the monthly and the wet nurse.
10136-8{_}29676{_}Of the former we have already spoken, and will now proceed to describe the duties of the latter, and add some suggestions as to her age, physical health, and moral conduct, subjects of the utmost importance as far as the charge intrusted to her is concerned, and therefore demanding some special remarks.
10136-8{_}29677{_}2438.
10136-8{_}29678{_}When from illness, suppression of the milk, accident, or some natural process, the mother is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her infant, it becomes necessary at once to look around for a fitting substitute, so that the child may not suffer, by any needless delay, a physical loss by the deprivation of its natural food.
10136-8{_}29679{_}The first consideration should be as regards age, state of health, and temper.
10136-8{_}29680{_}2439.
10136-8{_}29681{_}The age, if possible, should not be less than twenty nor exceed thirty years, with the health sound in every respect, and the body free from all eruptive disease or local blemish.
10136-8{_}29682{_}The best evidence of a sound state of health will be found in the woman's clear open countenance, the ruddy tone of the skin, the full, round, and elastic state of the breasts, and especially in the erectile, firm condition of the nipple, which, in all unhealthy states of the body, is pendulous, flabby, and relaxed; in which case, the milk is sure to be imperfect in its organization, and, consequently, deficient in its nutrient qualities.
10136-8{_}29683{_}Appetite is another indication of health in the suckling nurse or mother; for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having a corresponding appetite; and though inordinate craving for food is neither desirable nor necessary, a natural vigour should be experienced at meal-times, and the food taken should be anticipated and enjoyed.
10136-8{_}29684{_}2440.
10136-8{_}29685{_}Besides her health, the moral state of the nurse is to be taken into account, or that mental discipline or principle of conduct which would deter the nurse from at any time gratifying her own pleasures and appetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge.
10136-8{_}29686{_}2441.
10136-8{_}29687{_}The conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so acting are, unfortunately, very rare; and many nurses, rather than forego the enjoyment of a favourite dish, though morally certain of the effect it will have on the child, will, on the first opportunity, feed with avidity on fried meats, cabbage, cucumbers, pickles, or other crude and injurious aliments, in defiance of all orders given, or confidence reposed in their word, good sense, and humanity.
10136-8{_}29688{_}And when the infant is afterwards racked with pain, and a night of disquiet alarms the mother, the doctor is sent for, and the nurse, covering her dereliction by a falsehood, the consequence of her gluttony is treated as a disease, and the poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines, that can do it but little if any good, and, in all probability, materially retard its physical development.
10136-8{_}29689{_}The selfish nurse, in her ignorance, believes, too, that as long as she experiences no admonitory symptoms herself, the child cannot suffer; and satisfied that, whatever is the cause of its screams and plunges, neither she, nor what she had eaten, had anything to do with it, with this flattering assurance at her heart, she watches her opportunity, and has another luxurious feast off the proscribed dainties, till the increasing disturbance in the child's health, or treachery from the kitchen, opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the nurse's unprincipled conduct.
10136-8{_}29690{_}In all such cases the infant should be spared the infliction of medicine, and, as a wholesome corrective to herself, and relief to her charge, a good sound dose administered to the nurse.
10136-8{_}29691{_}2442.
10136-8{_}29692{_}Respecting the diet of the wet-nurse, the first point of importance is to fix early and definite hours for every meal; and the mother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere with their punctuality.
10136-8{_}29693{_}The food itself should be light, easy of digestion, and simple.
10136-8{_}29694{_}Boiled or roast meat, with bread and potatoes, with occasionally a piece of sago, rice, or tapioca pudding, should constitute the dinner, the only meal that requires special comment; broths, green vegetables, and all acid or salt foods, must be avoided.
10136-8{_}29695{_}Fresh fish, once or twice a week, may be taken; but it is hardly sufficiently nutritious to be often used as a meal.
10136-8{_}29696{_}If the dinner is taken early,--at one o'clock,--there will be no occasion for luncheon, which too often, to the injury of the child, is made the cover for a first dinner.
10136-8{_}29697{_}Half a pint of stout, with a Reading biscuit, at eleven o'clock, will be abundantly sufficient between breakfast at eight and a good dinner, with a pint of porter at one o'clock.
10136-8{_}29698{_}About eight o'clock in the evening, half a pint of stout, with another biscuit, may be taken; and for supper, at ten or half-past, a pint of porter, with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and cheese, may conclude the feeding for the day.
10136-8{_}29699{_}2443.
10136-8{_}29700{_}Animal food once in twenty-four hours is quite sufficient.
10136-8{_}29701{_}All spirits, unless in extreme cases, should be avoided; and wine is still more seldom needed.
10136-8{_}29702{_}With a due quantity of plain digestible food, and the proportion of stout and porter ordered, with early hours and regularity, the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself, but fully capable of rearing a child in health and strength.
10136-8{_}29703{_}There are two points all mothers, who are obliged to employ wet-nurses, should remember, and be on their guard against.
10136-8{_}29704{_}The first is, never to allow a nurse to give medicine to the infant on her own authority: many have such an infatuated idea of the _healing excellence_ of castor-oil, that they would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice a week, and think they had done a meritorious service to the child.
10136-8{_}29705{_}The next point is, to watch carefully, lest, to insure a night's sleep for herself, she does not dose the infant with Godfrey's cordial, syrup of poppies, or some narcotic potion, to insure tranquillity to the one and give the opportunity of sleep to the other.
10136-8{_}29706{_}The fact that scores of nurses keep secret bottles of these deadly syrups, for the purpose of stilling their charges, is notorious; and that many use them to a fearful extent, is sufficiently patent to all.
10136-8{_}29707{_}2444.
10136-8{_}29708{_}It therefore behoves the mother, while obliged to trust to a nurse, to use her best discretion to guard her child from the unprincipled treatment of the person she must, to a certain extent, depend upon and trust; and to remember, in all cases, rather than resort to castor-oil or sedatives, to consult a medical man for her infant in preference to following the counsel of her nurse.
10136-8{_}29709{_}THE REARING, MANAGEMENT, AND DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD.
10136-8{_}29710{_}CHAPTER XLII.
10136-8{_}29711{_}Physiology of Life, as illustrated by Respiration, Circulation, and Digestion.
10136-8{_}29712{_}2445.
10136-8{_}29713{_}The infantine management of children, like the mother's love for her offspring, seems to be born with the child, and to be a direct intelligence of Nature.
10136-8{_}29714{_}It may thus, at first sight, appear as inconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as to instruct her in the manner of loving it.
10136-8{_}29715{_}Yet, though Nature is unquestionably the best nurse, Art makes so admirable a foster-mother, that no sensible woman, in her novitiate of parent, would refuse the admonitions of art, or the teachings of experience, to consummate her duties of nurse.
10136-8{_}29716{_}It is true that, in a civilized state of society, few young wives reach the epoch that makes them mothers without some insight, traditional or practical, into the management of infants: consequently, the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided intelligence, or what, in such a case, may be called instinct, and obliged to trust to the promptings of nature alone for the well-being of her child, are very rare indeed.
10136-8{_}29717{_}Again, every woman is not gifted with the same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother; and though Nature, as a general rule, has endowed all female creation with the attributes necessary to that most beautiful and, at the same time, holiest function,--the healthy rearing of their offspring,--the cases are sufficiently numerous to establish the exception, where the mother is either physically or socially incapacitated from undertaking these most pleasing duties herself, and where, consequently, she is compelled to trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at once the mother's pride and delight to render to her child.
10136-8{_}29718{_}2446.
10136-8{_}29719{_}In these cases, when obliged to call in the services of hired assistance, she must trust the dearest obligation of her life to one who, from her social sphere, has probably notions of rearing children diametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother, and at enmity with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position.
10136-8{_}29720{_}2447.
10136-8{_}29721{_}It has justly been said--we think by Hood--that the children of the poor are not brought up, but _dragged up_.
10136-8{_}29722{_}However facetious this remark may seem, there is much truth in it; and that children, reared in the reeking dens of squalor and poverty, live at all, is an apparent anomaly in the course of things, that, at first sight, would seem to set the laws of sanitary provision at defiance, and make it appear a perfect waste of time to insist on pure air and exercise as indispensable necessaries of life, and especially so as regards infantine existence.
10136-8{_}29723{_}2448.
10136-8{_}29724{_}We see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children, everything studied that can tend to their personal comfort,--pure air, pure water, regular ablution, a dietary prescribed by art, and every precaution adopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate, for the well-being of the parents' hope; and find, in despite of all this care and vigilance, disease and death invading the guarded treasure.
10136-8{_}29725{_}We turn to the foetor and darkness that, in some obscure court, attend the robust brood who, coated in dirt, and with mud and refuse for playthings, live and thrive, and grow into manhood, and, in contrast to the pale face and flabby flesh of the aristocratic child, exhibit strength, vigour, and well-developed frames, and our belief in the potency of the life-giving elements of air, light, and cleanliness receives a shock that, at first sight, would appear fatal to the implied benefits of these, in reality, all-sufficient attributes of health and life.
10136-8{_}29726{_}2449.
10136-8{_}29727{_}But as we must enter more largely on this subject hereafter, we shall leave its consideration for the present, and return to what we were about to say respecting trusting to others' aid in the rearing of children.
10136-8{_}29728{_}Here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother may find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her, in as far as, knowing the simplest and best system to adopt, she may be able to instruct another, and see that her directions are fully carried out.
10136-8{_}29729{_}2450.
10136-8{_}29730{_}The human body, materially considered, is a beautiful piece of mechanism, consisting of many parts, each one being the centre of a system, and performing its own vital function irrespectively of the others, and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health of the whole.
10136-8{_}29731{_}It is, in fact, to a certain extent, like a watch, which, when once wound up and set in motion, will continue its function of recording true time only so long as every wheel, spring, and lever performs its allotted duty, and at its allotted time; or till the limit that man's ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton has been reached, or, in other words, till it has run down.
10136-8{_}29732{_}2451.
10136-8{_}29733{_}What the key is to the mechanical watch, air is to the physical man.
10136-8{_}29734{_}Once admit air into the mouth and nostrils, and the lungs expand, the heart beats, the blood rushes to the remotest part of the body, the mouth secretes saliva, to soften and macerate the food; the liver forms its bile, to separate the nutriment from the digested aliment; the kidneys perform their office; the eye elaborates its tears, to facilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on which depends so much of its beauty; and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin, protecting the body from the extremes of heat and cold, and sharpening the perception of touch and feeling.
10136-8{_}29735{_}At the same instant, and in every part, the arteries, like innumerable bees, are everywhere laying down layers of muscle, bones, teeth, and, in fact, like the coral zoophyte, building up a continent of life and matter; while the veins, equally busy, are carrying away the _débris_ and refuse collected from where the zoophyte arteries are building,--this refuse, in its turn, being conveyed to the liver, there to be converted into bile.
10136-8{_}29736{_}2452.
10136-8{_}29737{_}All these--and they are but a few of the vital actions constantly taking place--are the instant result of one gasp of life-giving air.
10136-8{_}29738{_}No subject can be fraught with greater interest than watching the first spark of life, as it courses with electric speed "through all the gates and alleys" of the soft, insensate body of the infant.
10136-8{_}29739{_}The effect of air on the new-born child is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful in its consequence; but to understand this more intelligibly, it must first be remembered that life consists of the performance of _three_ vital functions--RESPIRATION, CIRCULATION, and DIGESTION.
10136-8{_}29740{_}The lungs digest the air, taking from it its most nutritious element, the _oxygen_, to give to the impoverished blood that circulates through them.
10136-8{_}29741{_}The stomach digests the food, and separates the nutriment--_chyle_--from the aliment, which it gives to the blood for the development of the frame; and the blood, which is understood by the term circulation, digests in its passage through the lungs the nutriment--_chyle_--to give it quantity and quality, and the _oxygen_ from the air to give it vitality.
10136-8{_}29742{_}Hence it will be seen, that, speaking generally, the three vital functions resolve themselves into one,--DIGESTION; and that the lungs are the primary and the most important of the vital organs; and respiration, the first in fact, as we all know it is the last in deed, of all the functions performed by the living body.
10136-8{_}29743{_}THE LUNGS.--RESPIRATION.
10136-8{_}29744{_}2453.
10136-8{_}29745{_}The first effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the lips and angles of the mouth, increasing to twitchings, and finally to a convulsive contraction of the lips and cheeks, the consequence of sudden cold to the nerves of the face.
10136-8{_}29746{_}This spasmodic action produces a gasp, causing the air to rush through the mouth and nostrils, and enter the windpipe and upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs, which, like a sponge partly immersed in water, immediately expand.
10136-8{_}29747{_}This is succeeded by a few faint sobs or pants, by which larger volumes of air are drawn into the chest, till, after a few seconds, and when a greater bulk of the lungs has become inflated, the breast-bone and ribs rise, the chest expands, and, with a sudden start, the infant gives utterance to a succession of loud, sharp cries, which have the effect of filling every cell of the entire organ with air and life.
10136-8{_}29748{_}To the anxious mother, the first voice of her child is, doubtless, the sweetest music she ever heard; and the more loudly it peals, the greater should be her joy, as it is an indication of health and strength, and not only shows the perfect expansion of the lungs, but that the process of life has set in with vigour.
10136-8{_}29749{_}Having welcomed in its own existence, like the morning bird, with a shrill note of gladness, the infant ceases its cry, and, after a few short sobs, usually subsides into sleep or quietude.
10136-8{_}29750{_}2454.
10136-8{_}29751{_}At the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs, the valve, or door between the two sides of the heart-and through which the blood had previously passed-is closed and hermetically sealed, and the blood taking a new course, bounds into the lungs, now expanded with air, and which we have likened to a wetted sponge, to which they bear a not unapt affinity, air being substituted for water.
10136-8{_}29752{_}It here receives the _oxygen_ from the atmosphere, and the _chyle_, or white blood, from the digested food, and becomes, in an instant, arterial blood, a vital principle, from which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed.
10136-8{_}29753{_}Besides the lungs, Nature has provided another respiratory organ, a sort of supplemental lung, that, as well as being a covering to the body, _in_spires air and _ex_pires moisture;--this is the cuticle, or skin; and so intimate is the connection between the skin and lungs, that whatever injures the first, is certain to affect the latter.
10136-8{_}29754{_}2455.
10136-8{_}29755{_}_Hence the difficulty of breathing experienced after scalds or burns on the cuticle, the cough that follows the absorption of cold or damp by the skin, the oppressed and laborious breathing experienced by children in all eruptive diseases, while the rash is coming to the surface, and the hot, dry skin that always attends congestion of the lungs, and fever._  2456.
10136-8{_}29756{_}The great practical advantage derivable from this fact is, the knowledge that whatever relieves the one benefits the other.
10136-8{_}29757{_}Hence, too, the great utility of hot baths in all affections of the lungs or diseases of the skin; and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is, in nearly all cases, followed by tightness of the chest, sore throat, difficulty of breathing, and cough.
10136-8{_}29758{_}These symptoms are the consequence of a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining in the lungs, and the cough is a mere effort of Nature to throw off the obstruction caused by the presence of too much blood in the organ of respiration.
10136-8{_}29759{_}The hot bath, by causing a larger amount of blood to rush suddenly to the skin, has the effect of relieving the lungs of their excess of blood, and by equalizing the circulation, and promoting perspiration from the cuticle, affords immediate and direct benefit, both to the lungs and the system at large.
10136-8{_}29760{_}THE STOMACH--DIGESTION.
10136-8{_}29761{_}2457.
10136-8{_}29762{_}The organs that either directly or indirectly contribute to the process of digestion are, the mouth, teeth, tongue, and gullet, the stomach, small intestines, the pancreas, the salivary glands, and the liver.
10136-8{_}29763{_}Next to respiration, digestion is the chief function in the economy of life, as, without the nutritious fluid digested from the aliment, there would be nothing to supply the immense and constantly recurring waste of the system, caused by the activity with which the arteries at all periods, but especially during infancy and youth, are building up the frame and developing the body.
10136-8{_}29764{_}In infancy (the period of which our present subject treats), the series of parts engaged in the process of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach and liver, or rather its secretion,--the bile.
10136-8{_}29765{_}The stomach is a thick muscular bag, connected above with the gullet, and, at its lower extremity, with the commencement of the small intestines.
10136-8{_}29766{_}The duty or function of the stomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surface, a sharp acid liquid called the _gastric_ juice; this, with a due mixture of saliva, softens, dissolves, and gradually digests the food or contents of the stomach, reducing the whole into a soft pulpy mass, which then passes into the first part of the small intestines, where it comes in contact with the bile from the gall-bladder, which immediately separates the digested food into two parts, one is a white creamy fluid called chyle, and the absolute concentration of all nourishment, which is taken up by proper vessels, and, as we have before said, carried directly to the heart, to be made blood of, and vitalized in the lungs, and thus provide for the wear and tear of the system.
10136-8{_}29767{_}It must be here observed that the stomach can only digest solids, for fluids, being incapable of that process, can only be _absorbed_; and without the result of digestion, animal, at least human life, could not exist.
10136-8{_}29768{_}Now, as Nature has ordained that infantine life shall be supported on liquid aliment, and as, without a digestion the body would perish, some provision was necessary to meet this difficulty, and that provision was found in the nature of the liquid itself, or in other words, THE MILK.
10136-8{_}29769{_}The process of making cheese, or fresh curds and whey, is familiar to most persons; but as it is necessary to the elucidation of our subject, we will briefly repeat it.
10136-8{_}29770{_}The internal membrane, or the lining coat of a calf's stomach, having been removed from the organ, is hung up, like a bladder, to dry; when required, a piece is cut off, put in a jug, a little warm water poured upon it, and after a few hours it is fit for use; the liquid so made being called _rennet_.
10136-8{_}29771{_}A little of this rennet, poured into a basin of warm milk, at once coagulates the greater part, and separates from it a quantity of thin liquor, called _whey_.
10136-8{_}29772{_}This is precisely the action that takes place in the infant's stomach after every supply from the breast.
10136-8{_}29773{_}The cause is the same in both cases, the acid of the gastric juice in the infant's stomach immediately converting the milk into a soft cheese.
10136-8{_}29774{_}It is gastric juice, adhering to the calf's stomach, and drawn out by the water, forming rennet, that makes the curds in the basin.
10136-8{_}29775{_}The cheesy substance being a solid, at once undergoes the process of digestion, is separated into _chyle_ by the bile, and, in a few hours, finds its way to the infant's heart, to become blood, and commence the architecture of its little frame.
10136-8{_}29776{_}This is the simple process of a baby's digestion:-milk converted into cheese, cheese into _chyle_, chyle into blood, and blood into flesh, bone, and tegument-how simple is the cause, but how sublime and wonderful are the effects!
10136-8{_}29777{_}2458.
10136-8{_}29778{_}We have described the most important of the three functions that take place in the infant's body-respiration and digestion; the third, namely, circulation, we hardly think it necessary to enter on, not being called for by the requirements of the nurse and mother; so we shall omit its notice, and proceed from theoretical to more practical considerations.
10136-8{_}29779{_}Children of weakly constitutions are just as likely to be born of robust parents, and those who earn their bread by toil, as the offspring of luxury and affluence; and, indeed, it is against the ordinary providence of Nature to suppose the children of the hardworking and necessitous to be hardier and more vigorous than those of parents blessed with ease and competence.
10136-8{_}29780{_}2459.
10136-8{_}29781{_}All children come into the world in the same imploring helplessness, with the same general organization and wants, and demanding either from the newly-awakened mother's love, or from the memory of motherly feeling in the nurse, or the common appeals of humanity in those who undertake the earliest duties of an infant, the same assistance and protection, and the same fostering care.
10136-8{_}29782{_}THE INFANT.
10136-8{_}29783{_}2460.
10136-8{_}29784{_}We have already described the phenomena produced on the new-born child by the contact of air, which, after a succession of muscular twitchings, becomes endowed with voice, and heralds its advent by a loud but brief succession of cries.
10136-8{_}29785{_}But though this is the general rule, it sometimes happens (from causes it is unnecessary here to explain) that the infant does not cry, or give utterance to any audible sounds, or if it does, they are so faint as scarcely to be distinguished as human accents, plainly indicating that life, as yet, to the new visitor, is neither a boon nor a blessing; the infant being, in fact, in a state of suspended or imperfect vitality,--a state of _quasi_ existence, closely approximating the condition of a _still-birth_.
10136-8{_}29786{_}2461.
10136-8{_}29787{_}As soon as this state of things is discovered, the child should be turned on its right side, and the whole length of the spine, from the head downwards, rubbed with all the fingers of the right hand, sharply and quickly, without intermission, till the quick action has not only evoked heat, but electricity in the part, and till the loud and sharp cries of the child have thoroughly expanded the lungs, and satisfactorily established its life.
10136-8{_}29788{_}The operation will seldom require above a minute to effect, and less frequently demands a repetition.
10136-8{_}29789{_}If there is brandy at hand, the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into that, or any other spirit.
10136-8{_}29790{_}2462.
10136-8{_}29791{_}There-is another condition of what we may call "mute births," where the child only makes short ineffectual gasps, and those at intervals of a minute or two apart, when the lips, eyelids, and fingers become of a deep purple or slate colour, sometimes half the body remaining white, while the other half, which was at first swarthy, deepens to a livid hue.
10136-8{_}29792{_}This condition of the infant is owing to the valve between the two sides of the heart remaining open, and allowing the unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the circulation.
10136-8{_}29793{_}2463.
10136-8{_}29794{_}The object in this case, as in the previous one, is to dilate the lungs as quickly as possible, so that, by the sudden effect of a vigorous inspiration, the valve may be firmly closed, and the impure blood, losing this means of egress, be sent directly to the lungs.
10136-8{_}29795{_}The same treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case, with the addition, if the friction along the spine has failed, of a warm bath at a temperature of about 80°, in which the child is to be plunged up to the neck, first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might interfere with the free passage of air.
10136-8{_}29796{_}2464.
10136-8{_}29797{_}While in the bath, the friction along the spine is to be continued, and if the lungs still remain unexpended, while one person retains the child in an inclined position in the water, another should insert the pipe of a small pair of bellows into one nostril, and while the month is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with the hand of the assistant, the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady puffs of air from the bellows, the hand being removed from the mouth and nose after each inflation, and placed on the pit of the stomach, and by a steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth.
10136-8{_}29798{_}This process is to be continued, steadily inflating and expelling the air from the lungs, till, with a sort of tremulous leap, Nature takes up the process, and the infant begins to gasp, and finally to cry, at first low and faint, but with every gulp of air increasing in length and strength of volume, when it is to be removed from the water, and instantly wrapped (all but the face and mouth) in a flannel.
10136-8{_}29799{_}Sometimes, however, all these means will fail in effecting an utterance from the child, which will lie, with livid lips and a flaccid body, every few minutes opening its mouth with a short gasping pant, and then subsiding into a state of pulseless inaction, lingering probably some hours, till the spasmodic pantings growing further apart, it ceases to exist.
10136-8{_}29800{_}2465.
10136-8{_}29801{_}The time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the frame of an infant is remarkable; and even when all the previous operations, though long-continued, have proved ineffectual, the child will often rally from the simplest of means--the application of dry heat.
10136-8{_}29802{_}When removed from the bath, place three or four hot bricks or tiles on the hearth, and lay the child, loosely folded in a flannel, on its back along them, taking care that there is but one fold of flannel between the spine and heated bricks or tiles.
10136-8{_}29803{_}When neither of these articles can be procured, put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a warming-pan, and extend the child in the same manner along the closed lid.
10136-8{_}29804{_}As the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow, the child that was dying, or seemingly dead, will frequently give a sudden and energetic cry, succeeded in another minute by a long and vigorous peal, making up, in volume and force, for the previous delay, and instantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature.
10136-8{_}29805{_}2466.
10136-8{_}29806{_}With these two exceptions,--restored by the means we have pointed out to the functions of life,--we will proceed to the consideration of the child HEALTHILY BORN.
10136-8{_}29807{_}Here the first thing that meets us on the threshold of inquiry, and what is often between mother and nurse not only a vexed question, but one of vexatious import, is the _crying_ of the child; the mother, in her natural anxiety, maintaining that her infant _must be ill_ to cause it to cry so much or so often, and the nurse insisting that _all_ children cry, and that nothing is the matter with it, and that crying does good, and is, indeed, an especial benefit to infancy.
10136-8{_}29808{_}The anxious and unfamiliar mother, though not convinced by these abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom of the explanation, takes both for granted; and, giving the nurse credit for more knowledge and experience on this head than she can have, contentedly resigns herself to the infliction, as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of the baby, but thinking it, at the same time, an extraordinary instance of the imperfectibility of Nature as regards the human infant; for her mind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and kittens, who, except when rudely torn from their nurse, seldom give utterance to any complaining.
10136-8{_}29809{_}2467.
10136-8{_}29810{_}We, undoubtedly, believe that crying, to a certain extent, is not only conducive to health, but positively necessary to the full development and physical economy of the infant's being.
10136-8{_}29811{_}But though holding this opinion, we are far from believing that a child does not very often cry from pain, thirst, want of food, and attention to its personal comfort; but there is as much difference in the tone and expression of a child's cry as in the notes of an adult's voice; and the mother's ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp peevish whine of irritation and fever, and the louder intermitting cry that characterizes the want of warmth and sleep.
10136-8{_}29812{_}All these shades of expression in the child's inarticulate voice every nurse _should_ understand, and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them with an accuracy equal to language.
10136-8{_}29813{_}2468.
10136-8{_}29814{_}There is no part of a woman's duty to her child that a young mother should so soon make it her business to study, as the voice of her infant, and the language conveyed in its cry.
10136-8{_}29815{_}The study is neither hard nor difficult; a close attention to its tone, and the expression of the baby's features, are the two most important points demanding attention.
10136-8{_}29816{_}The key to both the mother will find in her own heart, and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and smile of her infant.
10136-8{_}29817{_}We have two reasons--both strong ones--for urging on mothers the imperative necessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and wants of their child: the first, that when left to the entire, responsibility of the baby, after the departure of the nurse, she may be able to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to her own resources and mother's instinct, without a clue to guide her through the mysteries of those calls that vibrate through every nerve of her nature; and, secondly, that she may be able to guard her child from the nefarious practices of unprincipled nurses, who, while calming the mother's mind with false statements as to the character of the baby's cries, rather than lose their rest, or devote that time which would remove the cause of suffering, administer, behind the curtains, those deadly narcotics which, while stupefying Nature into sleep, insure for herself a night of many unbroken hours.
10136-8{_}29818{_}Such nurses as have not the hardihood to dose their infant charges, are often full of other schemes to still that constant and reproachful cry.
10136-8{_}29819{_}The most frequent means employed for this purpose is giving it something to suck,--something easily hid from the mother,--or, when that is impossible, under the plea of keeping it warm, the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl, and, under this blind, surreptitiously inserts a finger between the parched lips, which possibly moan for drink; and, under this inhuman cheat and delusion, the infant is pacified, till Nature, balked of its desires, drops into a troubled sleep.
10136-8{_}29820{_}These are two of our reasons for impressing upon mothers the early, the immediate necessity of putting themselves sympathetically in communication with their child, by at once learning its hidden language as a delightful task.
10136-8{_}29821{_}2469.
10136-8{_}29822{_}We must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow the nurse to sleep with the baby, never herself to lay down with it by her side for a night's rest, never to let it sleep in the parents' bed, and on no account keep it, longer than absolutely necessary, confined in on atmosphere loaded with the breath of many adults.
10136-8{_}29823{_}2470.
10136-8{_}29824{_}The amount of _oxygen_ required by an infant is so large, and the quantity consumed by mid-life and age, and the proportion of carbonic acid thrown off from both, so considerable, that an infant breathing the same air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while deriving its vitality from so corrupted a medium.
10136-8{_}29825{_}This objection, always in force, is still more objectionable at night-time, when doors and windows are closed, and amounts to a condition of poison, when placed between two adults in sleep, and shut in by bed-curtains; and when, in addition to the impurities expired from the lungs, we remember, in quiescence and sleep, how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin.
10136-8{_}29826{_}2471.
10136-8{_}29827{_}Mothers, in the fullness of their affection, believe there is no harbour, sleeping or awake, where their infants can be so secure from all possible or probable danger as in their own arms; yet we should astound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants who, in despite of their motherly solicitude and love, are annually killed, unwittingly, by such parents themselves, and this from the persistency in the practice we are so strenuously condemning.
10136-8{_}29828{_}The mother frequently, on awaking, discovers the baby's face closely impacted between her bosom and her arm, and its body rigid and lifeless; or else so enveloped in the "head-blanket" and superincumbent bedclothes, as to render breathing a matter of physical impossibility.
10136-8{_}29829{_}In such cases the jury in general returns a verdict of "_Accidentally overlaid_" but one of "Careless suffocation" would be more in accordance with truth and justice.
10136-8{_}29830{_}The only possible excuse that can be urged, either by nurse or mother, for this culpable practice, is the plea of imparting warmth to the infant.
10136-8{_}29831{_}But this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the child's crib, or, if the weather is particularly cold, by a bottle of hot water enveloped in flannel and placed at the child's feet; while all the objections already urged--as derivable from animal heat imparted by actual contact--are entirely obviated.
10136-8{_}29832{_}There is another evil attending the sleeping together of the mother and infant, which, as far as regards the latter, we consider quite as formidable, though not so immediate as the others, and is always followed by more or less of mischief to the mother.
10136-8{_}29833{_}The evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice of letting the child _suck_ after the mother has _fallen asleep_, a custom that naturally results from the former, and which, as we hare already said, is injurious to both mother and child.
10136-8{_}29834{_}It is injurious to the infant by allowing it, without control, to imbibe to distension a fluid sluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the want of mental energy, and of the sympathetic appeals of the child on the mother, so powerfully produce on the secreted nutriment, while the mother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion, with giddiness, dimness of sight, nausea, loss of appetite, and a dull aching pain through the back and between the shoulders.
10136-8{_}29835{_}In fact, she wakes languid and unrefreshed from her sleep, with febrile symptoms and hectic flushes, caused by her baby vampire, who, while dragging from her her health and strength, has excited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite, but fraught with the same injurious consequences--"functional derangement."
10136-8{_}29836{_}THE MILK.
10136-8{_}29837{_}2472.
10136-8{_}29838{_}As Nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food of her offspring, it must be self-evident to every reflecting woman, that it becomes her duty to study, as far as lies in her power, to keep that reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition as possible; for she must remember that the _quantity_ is no proof of the _quality_ of this aliment.
10136-8{_}29839{_}2473.
10136-8{_}29840{_}The mother, while suckling, as a general rule, should avoid all sedentary occupations, take regular exercise, keep her mind as lively and pleasingly occupied as possible, especially by music and singing.
10136-8{_}29841{_}Her diet should be light and nutritious, with a proper sufficiency of animal food, and of that kind which yields the largest amount of nourishment; and, unless the digestion is naturally strong, vegetables and fruit should form a very small proportion of the general dietary, and such preparations as broths, gruels, arrowroot, &c., still less.
10136-8{_}29842{_}Tapioca, or ground-rice pudding, made with several eggs, may be taken freely; but all slops and thin potations, such as that delusion called chicken-broth, should be avoided, as yielding a very small amount of nutriment, and a large proportion of flatulence.
10136-8{_}29843{_}All purely stimulants should be avoided as much as possible, especially spirits, unless taken for some special object, and that medicinally; but as a part of the dietary they should be carefully shunned.
10136-8{_}29844{_}Lactation is always an exhausting process, and as the child increases in size and strength, the drain upon the mother becomes great and depressing.
10136-8{_}29845{_}Then something more even than an abundant diet is required to keep the mind and body up to a standard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant and nutritious secretion being performed without detriment to the physical integrity of the mother, or injury to the child who imbibes it; and as stimulants are inadmissible, if not positively injurious, the substitute required is to be found in _malt liquor_.
10136-8{_}29846{_}To the lady accustomed to her Madeira and sherry, this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young mother to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of wine; but as we are writing from experience, and with the avowed object of imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to our readers, we allow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object.
10136-8{_}29847{_}2474.
10136-8{_}29848{_}We have already said that the suckling mother should avoid stimulants, especially spirituous ones; and though something of this sort is absolutely necessary to support her strength during the exhausting process, it should be rather of a _tonic_ than of a stimulating character; and as all wines contain a large percentage of brandy, they are on that account less beneficial than the pure juice of the fermented grape might be.
10136-8{_}29849{_}But there is another consideration to be taken into account on this subject; the mother has not only to think of herself, but also of her infant.
10136-8{_}29850{_}Now wines, especially port wine, very often--indeed, most frequently--affect the baby's bowels, and what might have been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of pain and irritation to the child afterwards.
10136-8{_}29851{_}Sherry is less open to this objection than other wines, yet still _it_ very frequently does influence the second participator, or the child whose mother has taken it.
10136-8{_}29852{_}2475.
10136-8{_}29853{_}The nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be, to some extent, to most mothers, a period of privation and penance, and unless she is deaf to the cries of her baby, and insensible to its kicks and plunges, and will not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains that rack her child, she will avoid every article that can remotely affect the little being who draws its sustenance from her.
10136-8{_}29854{_}She will see that the babe is acutely affected by all that in any way influences her, and willingly curtail her own enjoyments, rather than see her infant rendered feverish, irritable, and uncomfortable.
10136-8{_}29855{_}As the best tonic, then, and the most efficacious indirect stimulant that a mother can take at such times, there is no potation equal to _porter_ and _stout_, or, what is better still, an equal part of porter and stout.
10136-8{_}29856{_}Ale, except for a few constitutions, is too subtle and too sweet, generally causing acidity or heartburn, and stout alone is too potent to admit of a full draught, from its proneness to affect the head; and quantity, as well as moderate strength, is required to make the draught effectual; the equal mixture, therefore, of stout and porter yields all the properties desired or desirable as a medicinal agent for this purpose.
10136-8{_}29857{_}2476.
10136-8{_}29858{_}Independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution, _porter exerts a marked and specific effect on the secretion of milk; more powerful in exciting an abundant supply of that fluid than any other article within the range of the physician's art;_ and, in cases of deficient quantity, is the most certain, speedy, and the healthiest means that can be employed to insure a quick and abundant flow.
10136-8{_}29859{_}In cases where malt liquor produces flatulency, a few grains of the "carbonate of soda" may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before drinking, which will have the effect of neutralizing any acidity that may be in the porter at the time, and will also prevent its after-disagreement with the stomach.
10136-8{_}29860{_}The quantity to be taken must depend upon the natural strength of the mother, the age and demand made by the infant on the parent, and other causes; but the amount should vary from _one_ to _two_ pints a day, never taking less than half a pint at a time, which should be repeated three or four times a day.
10136-8{_}29861{_}2477.
10136-8{_}29862{_}We have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to the mother, but this is not invariably the case; and, as so much must depend upon the natural strength of the stomach, and its power of assimilating all kinds of food into healthy _chyle_, it is impossible to define exceptions.
10136-8{_}29863{_}Where a woman feels she can eat any kind of food, without inconvenience or detriment, she should live during her suckling as she did before; but, as a general rule, we are bound to advise all mothers to abstain from such articles as pickles, fruits, cucumbers, and all acid and slowly digestible foods, unless they wish for restless nights and crying infants.
10136-8{_}29864{_}2478.
10136-8{_}29865{_}As regards exercise and amusement, we would certainly neither prohibit a mother's dancing, going to a theatre, nor even from attending an assembly.
10136-8{_}29866{_}The first, however, is the best indoor recreation she can take, and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the nursery with this most excellent means of healthful circulation.
10136-8{_}29867{_}The only precaution necessary is to avoid letting the child suck the milk that has lain long in the breast, or is heated by excessive action.
10136-8{_}29868{_}2479.
10136-8{_}29869{_}Every mother who can, should be provided with a breast-pump, or glass tube, to draw off the superabundance that has been accumulating in her absence from the child, or the first gush excited by undue exertion: the subsequent supply of milk will be secreted under the invigorating influence of a previous healthy stimulus.
10136-8{_}29870{_}2480.
10136-8{_}29871{_}As the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the saline elements, and is thin and innutritious, it is most admirably adapted for the purpose Nature designed it to fulfil,--that of an aperient; but which, unfortunately, it is seldom permitted, in our artificial mode of living, to perform.
10136-8{_}29872{_}2481.
10136-8{_}29873{_}So opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking new-born children, that, unless for positive illness, we would much rather advise that medicine should be administered _through_ the mother for the first eight or ten weeks of its existence.
10136-8{_}29874{_}This practice, which few mothers will object to, is easily effected by the parent, when such a course is necessary for the child, taking either a dose of castor-oil, half an ounce of tasteless salts (the phosphate of soda), one or two teaspoonfuls of magnesia, a dose of lenitive electuary, manna, or any mild and simple aperient, which, almost before it can have taken effect on herself, will exhibit its action on her child.
10136-8{_}29875{_}2482.
10136-8{_}29876{_}One of the most common errors that mothers fall into while suckling their children, is that of fancying they are always hungry, and consequently overfeeding them; and with this, the great mistake of applying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying, without investigating the cause of its complaint, and, under the belief that it wants food, putting the nipple into its crying mouth, until the infant turns in revulsion and petulance from what it should accept with eagerness and joy.
10136-8{_}29877{_}At such times, a few teaspoonfuls of water, slightly chilled, will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child, who has turned in loathing from the offered breast; or, after imbibing a few drops, and finding it not what nature craved, throws back its head in disgust, and cries more petulantly than before.
10136-8{_}29878{_}In such a case as this, the young mother, grieved at her baby's rejection of the tempting present, and distressed at its cries, and in terror of some injury, over and over ransacks its clothes, believing some insecure pin can alone be the cause of such sharp complaining, an accident that, from her own care in dressing, however, is seldom or ever the case.
10136-8{_}29879{_}2483.
10136-8{_}29880{_}These abrupt cries of the child, if they do not proceed from thirst, which a little water will relieve, not unfrequently occur from some unequal pressure, a fold or twist in the "roller," or some constriction round the tender body.
10136-8{_}29881{_}If this is suspected, the mother must not be content with merely slackening the strings; the child should be undressed, and the creases and folds of the hot skin, especially those about the thighs and groins, examined, to see that no powder has caked, and, becoming hard, irritated the parts.
10136-8{_}29882{_}The violet powder should be dusted freely over all, to cool the skin, and everything put on fresh and smooth.
10136-8{_}29883{_}If such precautions have not afforded relief, and, in addition to the crying, the child plunges or draws up its legs, the mother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or bowels,--either acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in the former; but, from whichever cause, the child should be "opened" before the fire, and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen, the infant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position, and while gently jolted on the knee, the back should be lightly patted with the hand.
10136-8{_}29884{_}2484.
10136-8{_}29885{_}Should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the _cause_ of inconvenience proceeds from the bladder--a not unfrequent source of pain,--the napkin is to be dipped in hot water, squeezed out, and immediately applied over the part, and repeated every eight or ten minutes, for several times in succession, either till the natural relief is afforded, or a cessation of pain allows of its discontinuance.
10136-8{_}29886{_}The pain that young infants often suffer, and the crying that results from it, is, as we have already said, frequently caused by the mother inconsiderately overfeeding her child, and is produced by the pain of distension, and the mechanical pressure of a larger quantity of fluid in the stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese and digest.
10136-8{_}29887{_}2485.
10136-8{_}29888{_}Some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach than others, and get rid of the excess by vomiting, concluding every process of suckling by an emission of milk and curd.
10136-8{_}29889{_}Such children are called by nurses "thriving children;" and generally they are so, simply because their digestion is good, and they have the power of expelling with impunity that superabundance of aliment which in others is a source of distension, flatulence, and pain.
10136-8{_}29890{_}2486.
10136-8{_}29891{_}The length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on the health and strength of the child, and the health of the mother, and the quantity and quality of her milk; though, when all circumstances are favourable, it should never be less than _nine_, nor exceed _fifteen_ months; but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between both.
10136-8{_}29892{_}But of this we may be sure, that Nature never ordained a child to live on suction after having endowed it with teeth to bite and to grind; and nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear a child, with a set of twenty teeth, ask for "the breast."
10136-8{_}29893{_}2487.
10136-8{_}29894{_}The practice of protracted wet-nursing is hurtful to the mother, by keeping up an uncalled-for, and, after the proper time, an unhealthy drain on her system, while the child either derives no benefit from what it no longer requires, or it produces a positive injury on its constitution.
10136-8{_}29895{_}After the period when Nature has ordained the child shall live by other means, the secretion of milk becomes thin and deteriorated, showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the child both its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating aliment.
10136-8{_}29896{_}2488.
10136-8{_}29897{_}Though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a baby should be suckled, we by no means wish to imply that a child should be fed exclusively on milk for its first year; quite the reverse; the infant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother.
10136-8{_}29898{_}Thus, should illness assail her, her milk fail, or any domestic cause abruptly cut off the natural supply, the child having been annealed to an artificial diet, its life might be safely carried on without seeking for a wet-nurse, and without the slightest danger to its system.
10136-8{_}29899{_}2489.
10136-8{_}29900{_}The advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to artificial food is as considerable to herself as beneficial to her infant; the demand on her physical strength in the first instance will be less severe and exhausting, the child will sleep longer on a less rapidly digestible aliment, and yield to both more quiet nights, and the mother will be more at liberty to go out for business or pleasure, another means of sustenance being at hand till her return.
10136-8{_}29901{_}Besides these advantages, by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding, the infant will acquire greater constitutional strength, so that, if attacked by sickness or disease, it will have a much greater chance of resisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother, whose milk, affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her offspring, is at such a time neither good in its properties nor likely to be beneficial to the patient.
10136-8{_}29902{_}2490.
10136-8{_}29903{_}All that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to mothers, that if they wish to keep a sound and unchapped nipple, and possibly avoid what is called a "broken breast," never to put it up with a wet nipple, but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness, and the moment that delicate part is drawn from the child's mouth, to dry it carefully of the milk and saliva that moisten it; and, further, to make a practice of suckling from each breast alternately.
10136-8{_}29904{_}Dress and Dressing, Washing, &c.  2491.
10136-8{_}29905{_}As respects the dress and dressing of a new-born infant, or of a child in arms, during any stage of its nursing, there are few women who will require us to give them guidance or directions for their instruction; and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of place here, yet most women intuitively "take to a baby," and, with a small amount of experience, are able to perform all the little offices necessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease and completeness.
10136-8{_}29906{_}We shall, therefore, on this delicate subject hold our peace; and only, from afar, _hint_ "at what we would," leaving our suggestions to be approved or rejected, according as they chime with the judgment and the apprehension of our motherly readers.
10136-8{_}29907{_}2492.
10136-8{_}29908{_}In these days of intelligence, there are few ladies who have not, in all probability, seen the manner in which the Indian squaw, the aborigines of Polynesia, and even the Lapp and Esquimaux, strap down their baby on a board, and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough of a tree, hang it up to the rafters of the hut, or on travel, dangle it on their backs, outside the domestic implements, which, as the slave of her master, man, the wronged but uncomplaining woman carries, in order that her lord may march in unhampered freedom.
10136-8{_}29909{_}Cruel and confining as this system of "backboard" dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom and exercise, it is positively less irksome, less confining, and infinitely less prejudicial to health, than the mummying of children by our grandmothers a hundred, ay, fifty years ago: for what with chin-stays, back-stays, body-stays, forehead-cloths, rollers, bandages, &c., an infant had as many girths and strings, to keep head, limbs, and body in one exact position, as a ship has halyards.
10136-8{_}29910{_}2493.
10136-8{_}29911{_}Much of this--indeed we may say all--has been abolished; but still the child is far from being dressed loosely enough; and we shall never be satisfied till the abominable use of the _pin_ is avoided _in toto_ in an infant's dressing, and a texture made for all the under garments of a child of a cool and elastic material.
10136-8{_}29912{_}2494.
10136-8{_}29913{_}The manner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the "roller," as if it had fractured ribs, compressing those organs--that, living on suction, must be, for the health of the child, to a certain degree distended, to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid imbibed--is perfectly preposterous.
10136-8{_}29914{_}Our humanity, as well as our duty, calls upon us at once to abrogate and discountenance by every means in our power.
10136-8{_}29915{_}Instead of the process of washing and dressing being made, as with the adult, a refreshment and comfort, it is, by the dawdling manner in which it is performed, the multiplicity of things used, and the perpetual change of position of the infant to adjust its complicated clothing, rendered an operation of positive irritation and annoyance.
10136-8{_}29916{_}We, therefore, entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true light, and study to the utmost, simplicity in dress, and dispatch in the process.
10136-8{_}29917{_}2495.
10136-8{_}29918{_}Children do not so much cry from the washing as from the irritation caused by the frequent change of position in which they are placed, the number of times they are turned on their face, on their back, and on their side, by the manipulations demanded by the multiplicity of articles to be fitted, tacked, and carefully adjusted on their bodies.
10136-8{_}29919{_}What mother ever found her girl of six or seven stand quiet while she was curling her hair?
10136-8{_}29920{_}How many times nightly has she not to reprove her for not standing still during the process!
10136-8{_}29921{_}It is the same with the unconscious infant, who cannot bear to be moved about, and who has no sooner grown reconciled to one position than it is forced reluctantly into another.
10136-8{_}29922{_}It is true, in one instance the child has intelligence to guide it, and in the other not; but the _motitory nerves_, in both instances, resent coercion, and a child cannot be too little handled.
10136-8{_}29923{_}2496.
10136-8{_}29924{_}On this account alone, and, for the moment, setting health and comfort out of the question, we beg mothers to simplify their baby's dress as much as possible; and not only to put on as little as is absolutely necessary, but to make that as simple in its contrivance and adjustment as it will admit of; to avoid belly-bands, rollers, girths, and everything that can impede or confine the natural expansion of the digestive organs, on the due performance of whose functions the child lives, thrives, and develops its physical being.
10136-8{_}29925{_}REARING BY HAND.
10136-8{_}29926{_}Articles necessary, and how to use them,--Preparation of Foods.-- Baths.--Advantages of Rearing by Hand.
10136-8{_}29927{_}2497.
10136-8{_}29928{_}As we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an artificial, in preference to the natural course of rearing children, we beg our renders to understand us perfectly on this head; all we desire to prove is the fact that a child _can_ be brought up as well on a spoon dietary as the best example to be found of those reared on the breast; having more strength, indeed, from the more nutritious food on which it lives.
10136-8{_}29929{_}It will be thus less liable to infectious diseases, and more capable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it; and without in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food, we wish to impress on the mother's mind that there are many cases of infantine debility which might eventuate in rickets, curvature of the spine, or mesenteric disease, where the addition to, or total substitution of, an artificial and more stimulating aliment, would not only give tone and strength to the constitution, but at the same time render the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary.
10136-8{_}29930{_}And, finally, though we would never--where the mother had the strength to suckle her child--supersede the breast, we would insist on making it a rule to accustom the child as early as possible to the use of an artificial diet, not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it over the ills of childhood, but that, in the absence of the mother, it might not miss the maternal sustenance; and also for the parent's sake, that, should the milk, from any cause, become vitiated, or suddenly cease, the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without the slightest apprehension of hurtful consequences.
10136-8{_}29931{_}2498.
10136-8{_}29932{_}To those persons unacquainted with the system, or who may have been erroneously informed on the matter, the rearing of a child by hand may seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties, and a large amount of personal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the duty.
10136-8{_}29933{_}This, however, is a fallacy in every respect, except as regards the fact of preparing the food; but even this extra amount of work, by adopting the course we shall lay down, may be reduced to a very small sum of inconvenience; and as respects anxiety, the only thing calling for care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food.
10136-8{_}29934{_}The articles required for the purpose of feeding an infant are a night-lamp, with its pan and lid, to keep the food warm; a nursing-bottle, with a prepared teat; and a small pap saucepan, for use by day.
10136-8{_}29935{_}Of the lamp we need hardly speak, most mothers being acquainted with its operation: but to those to whom it is unknown we may observe, that the flame from the floating rushlight heats the water in the reservoir above, in which the covered pan that contains the food floats, keeping it at such a heat that, when thinned by milk, it will be of a temperature suitable for immediate use.
10136-8{_}29936{_}Though many kinds of nursing-bottles have been lately invented, and some mounted with India-rubber nipples, the common glass bottle, with the calf's teat, is equal in cleanliness and utility to any; besides, the nipple put into the child's mouth is so white and natural in appearance, that no child taken from the breast will refuse it.
10136-8{_}29937{_}The black artificial ones of caoutchouc or gutta-percha are unnatural.
10136-8{_}29938{_}The prepared teats can be obtained at any chemist's, and as they are kept in spirits, they will require a little soaking in warm water, and gentle washing, before being tied securely, by means of fine twine, round the neck of the bottle, just sufficient being left projecting for the child to grasp freely in its lips; for if left the full length, or over long, it will be drawn too far into the mouth, and possibly make the infant heave.
10136-8{_}29939{_}When once properly adjusted, the nipple need never be removed till replaced by a new one, which will hardly be necessary oftener than once a fortnight, though with care one will last for several weeks.
10136-8{_}29940{_}The nursing-bottle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned every day, and always rinsed out before and after using it, the warm water being squeezed through the nipple, to wash out any particles of food that might lodge in the aperture, and become sour.
10136-8{_}29941{_}The teat can always be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle, when not in use, into a narrow jug containing water, taking care to dry it first, and then to warm it by drawing the food through before putting it into the child's mouth.
10136-8{_}29942{_}Food, and its Preparation.
10136-8{_}29943{_}2499.
10136-8{_}29944{_}The articles generally employed as food for infants consist of arrowroot, bread, flour, baked flour, prepared groats, farinaceous food, biscuit-powder, biscuits, tops-and-bottoms, and semolina, or manna croup, as it is otherwise called, which, like tapioca, is the prepared pith of certain vegetable substances.
10136-8{_}29945{_}Of this list the least efficacious, though, perhaps, the most believed in, is arrowroot, which only as a mere agent, for change, and then only for a very short time, should ever be employed as a means of diet to infancy or childhood.
10136-8{_}29946{_}It is a thin, flatulent, and innutritious food, and incapable of supporting infantine life with energy.
10136-8{_}29947{_}Bread, though the universal _régime_ with the labouring poor, where the infant's stomach and digestive powers are a reflex, in miniature, of the father's, should never be given to an infant under three months, and, even then, however finely beaten up and smoothly made, is a very questionable diet.
10136-8{_}29948{_}Flour, when well boiled, though infinitely better than arrowroot, is still only a kind of fermentative paste, that counteracts its own good by after-acidity and flatulence.
10136-8{_}29949{_}2500.
10136-8{_}29950{_}Baked flour, when cooked into a pale brown mass, and finely powdered, makes a far superior food to the others, and may be considered as a very useful diet, especially for a change.
10136-8{_}29951{_}Prepared groats may be classed with arrowroot and raw flour, as being innutritious.
10136-8{_}29952{_}The articles that now follow in our list are all good, and such as we could, with conscience and safety, trust to for the health and development of any child whatever.
10136-8{_}29953{_}2501.
10136-8{_}29954{_}We may observe in this place, that an occasional change in the character of the food is highly desirable, both as regards the health and benefit of the child; and though the interruption should only last for a day, the change will be advantageous.
10136-8{_}29955{_}2502.
10136-8{_}29956{_}The packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best aliment that can be given from the first to a baby, and may be continued, with the exception of an occasional change, without alteration of the material, till the child is able to take its regular meals of animal and vegetable food.
10136-8{_}29957{_}Some infants are so constituted as to require a frequent and total change in their system of living, seeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them, but if persevered in too long, declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as they had previously progressed.
10136-8{_}29958{_}In such cases the food should be immediately changed, and when that which appeared to agree best with the child is resumed, it should be altered in its quality, and perhaps in its consistency.
10136-8{_}29959{_}2503.
10136-8{_}29960{_}For the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet, containing instructions for the making; but, whatever the food employed is, enough should be made at once to last the day and night; at first, about a pint basinful, but, as the child advances, a quart will hardly be too much.
10136-8{_}29961{_}In all cases, let the food boil a sufficient time, constantly stirring, and taking every precaution that it does not get burnt, in which case it is on no account to be used.
10136-8{_}29962{_}2504.
10136-8{_}29963{_}The food should always be made with water, the whole sweetened at once, and of such a consistency that, when poured out, and it has had time to cool, it will cut with the firmness of a pudding or custard.
10136-8{_}29964{_}One or two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood on the hob till the heat has softened it, when enough milk is to be added, and carefully mixed with the food, till the whole has the consistency of ordinary cream; it is then to be poured into the nursing-bottle, and the food having been drawn through to warm the nipple, it is to be placed in the child's mouth.
10136-8{_}29965{_}For the first month or more, half a bottleful will be quite enough to give the infant at one time; but, as the child grows, it will be necessary not only to increase the quantity given at each time, but also gradually to make its food more consistent, and, after the third month, to add an egg to every pint basin of food made.
10136-8{_}29966{_}At night the mother puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp, instead of the saucepan--that is, enough for one supply, and, having lighted the rush, she will find, on the waking of her child, the food sufficiently hot to bear the cooling addition of the milk.
10136-8{_}29967{_}But, whether night or day, the same food should never be heated twice, and what the child leaves should be thrown away.
10136-8{_}29968{_}2505.
10136-8{_}29969{_}The biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous food, and both prepared much after the fashion of making starch.
10136-8{_}29970{_}But when tops-and-bottoms, or the whole biscuit, are employed, they require soaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling.
10136-8{_}29971{_}The biscuit or biscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will, when thoroughly soft, allow of their being beaten by a three-pronged fork into a fine, smooth, and even pulp, and which, when poured into a basin and become cold, will cut out like a custard.
10136-8{_}29972{_}If two large biscuits have been so treated, and the child is six or seven months old, beat up two eggs, sufficient sugar to properly sweeten it, and about a pint of skim milk.
10136-8{_}29973{_}Pour this on the beaten biscuit in the saucepan, stirring constantly; boil for about five minutes, pour into a basin, and use, when cold, in the same manner as the other.
10136-8{_}29974{_}2506.
10136-8{_}29975{_}This makes an admirable food, at once nutritious and strengthening.
10136-8{_}29976{_}When tops-and-bottoms or rusks are used, the quantity of the egg may be reduced, or altogether omitted.
10136-8{_}29977{_}2507.
10136-8{_}29978{_}Semolina, or manna croup, being in little hard grains, like a fine millet-seed, must be boiled for some time, and the milk, sugar, and egg added to it on the fire, and boiled for a few minutes longer, and, when cold, used as the other preparations.
10136-8{_}29979{_}2508.
10136-8{_}29980{_}Many persons entertain a belief that cow's milk is hurtful to infants, and, consequently, refrain from giving it; but this is a very great mistake, for both sugar and milk should form a large portion of every meal an infant takes.
10136-8{_}29981{_}TEETHING AND CONVULSIONS.
10136-8{_}29982{_}Fits, &c., the consequence of Dentition, and how to be treated.--The number and order of the Teeth, and manner in which they are cut.--First and Second Set.
10136-8{_}29983{_}2509.
10136-8{_}29984{_}About three months after birth, the infant's troubles may be said to begin; teeth commence forming in the gums, causing pain and irritation in the mouth, and which, but for the saliva it causes to flow so abundantly, would be attended with very serious consequences.
10136-8{_}29985{_}At the same time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the regimen imposed on her, and, taking some unusual or different food, excites diarrhoea or irritation in her child's stomach, which not unfrequently results in a rash on the skin, or slight febrile symptoms, which, if not subdued in their outset, superinduce some more serious form of infantine disease.
10136-8{_}29986{_}But, as a general rule, the teeth are the primary cause of much of the child's sufferings, in consequence of the state of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is thrown by their formation and progress out of the jaw and through the gums.
10136-8{_}29987{_}We propose beginning this branch of our subject with that most fertile source of an infant's suffering--  Teething.
10136-8{_}29988{_}2510.
10136-8{_}29989{_}That this subject may he better understood by the nurse and mother, and the reason of the constitutional disturbance that, to a greater or less degree, is experienced by all infants, may be made intelligible to those who have the care of children, we shall commence by giving a brief account of the formation of the teeth, the age at which they appear in the mouth, and the order in which they pierce the gums.
10136-8{_}29990{_}The organs of mastication in the adult consist of 32 distinct teeth, 16 in either jaw; being, in fact, a double set.
10136-8{_}29991{_}The teeth are divided into 4 incisors, 2 canine, 4 first and second grinders, and 6 molars; but in childhood the complement or first set consists of only twenty, and these only make their appearance as the development of the frame indicates the requirement of a different kind of food for the support of the system.
10136-8{_}29992{_}At birth some of the first-cut teeth are found in the cavities of the jaw, in a very small and rudimentary form; but this is by no means universal.
10136-8{_}29993{_}About the third month, the jaws, which are hollow and divided into separate cells, begin to expand, making room for the slowly developing teeth, which, arranged for beauty and economy of space lengthwise, gradually turn their tops upwards, piercing the gum by their edges, which, being sharp, assist in cutting a passage through the soft parts.
10136-8{_}29994{_}There is no particular period at which children cut their teeth, some being remarkably early, and others equally late.
10136-8{_}29995{_}The earliest age that we have ever ourselves known as a reliable fact was, _six weeks_.
10136-8{_}29996{_}Such peculiarities are generally hereditary, and, as in this case, common to a whole family.
10136-8{_}29997{_}The two extremes are probably represented by six and sixteen months.
10136-8{_}29998{_}Pain and drivelling are the usual, but by no means the general, indications of teething.
10136-8{_}29999{_}2511.
10136-8{_}30000{_}About the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen, presenting a red, shiny appearance, while the salivary glands pour out an unusual quantity of saliva.
10136-8{_}30001{_}After a time, a white line or round spot is observed on the top of one part of the gums, and the sharp edge of the tooth may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the part.
10136-8{_}30002{_}Through these white spots the teeth burst their way in the following order:--  2512.
10136-8{_}30003{_}Two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut, though, in general, some weeks elapse between the appearance of the first and the advent of the second.
10136-8{_}30004{_}The next teeth cut are the four incisors of the upper jaw.
10136-8{_}30005{_}The next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom, one on each side, then two top and two bottom on each side, but not joining the incisors; and lastly, about the eighteenth or twentieth month, the four eye teeth, filling up the space left between the side teeth and the incisors; thus completing the infant's set of sixteen.
10136-8{_}30006{_}Sometimes at the same period, but more frequently some months later, four more double teeth slowly make their appearance, one on each side of each jaw, completing the entire series of the child's first set of twenty teeth.
10136-8{_}30007{_}It is asserted that a child, while cutting its teeth, should either dribble excessively, vomit after every meal, or be greatly relaxed.
10136-8{_}30008{_}Though one or other, or all of these at once, may attend a case of teething, it by no means follows that any one of them should accompany this process of nature, though there can be no doubt that where the pain consequent on the unyielding state of the gums, and the firmness of the skin that covers the tooth, is severe, a copious discharge of saliva acts beneficially in saving the head, and also in guarding the child from those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their teething are liable.
10136-8{_}30009{_}2513.
10136-8{_}30010{_}_The Symptoms_ that generally indicate the cutting of teeth, in addition to the inflamed and swollen state of the gums, and increased flow of saliva, are the restless and peevish state of the child, the hands being thrust into the mouth, and the evident pleasure imparted by rubbing the finger or nail gently along the gum; the lips are often excoriated, and the functions of the stomach or bowels are out of order.
10136-8{_}30011{_}In severe cases, occurring in unhealthy or scrofulous children, there are, from the first, considerable fever, disturbed sleep, fretfulness, diarrhoea, rolling of the eyes, convulsive startings, laborious breathing, coma, or unnatural sleep, ending, unless the head is quickly relieved, in death.
10136-8{_}30012{_}2514.
10136-8{_}30013{_}The _Treatment_ in all cases of painful teething is remarkably simple, and consists in keeping the body cool by mild aperient medicines, allaying the irritation in the gums by friction with a rough ivory ring or a stale crust of broad, and when the head, lungs, or any organ is overloaded or unduly excited, to use the hot bath, and by throwing the body into a perspiration, equalize the circulation, and relieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination.
10136-8{_}30014{_}2515.
10136-8{_}30015{_}Besides these, there is another means, but that must be employed by a medical man; namely, scarifying the gums--an operation always safe, and which, when judiciously performed, and at a critical opportunity, will often snatch the child from the grasp of death.
10136-8{_}30016{_}2516.
10136-8{_}30017{_}There are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such strong and mistaken opinions as on that of lancing an infant's gums, some rather seeing their child go into fits--and by the unrelieved irritation endangering inflammation of the brain, water on the head, rickets, and other lingering affections--than permit the surgeon to afford instant relief by cutting through the hard skin, which, like a bladder over the stopper of a bottle, effectually confines the tooth to the socket, and prevents it piercing the soft, spongy substance of the gum.
10136-8{_}30018{_}This prejudice is a great error, as we shall presently show; for, so far from hurting the child, there is nothing that will so soon convert an infant's tears into smiles as scarifying the gums in painful teething; that is, if effectually done, and the skin of the tooth be divided.
10136-8{_}30019{_}2517.
10136-8{_}30020{_}Though teething is a natural function, and to an infant in perfect health should be unproductive of pain, yet in general it is not only a fertile cause of suffering, but often a source of alarm and danger; the former, from irritation in the stomach and bowels, deranging the whole economy of the system, and the latter, from coma and fits, that may excite alarm in severe cases; and the danger, that eventuates in some instances, from organic disease of the head or spinal marrow.
10136-8{_}30021{_}2518.
10136-8{_}30022{_}We shall say nothing in this place of "rickets," or "water on the head," which are frequent results of dental irritation, but proceed to finish our remarks on the treatment of teething.
10136-8{_}30023{_}Though strongly advocating the lancing of the gums in teething, and when there are any severe head-symptoms, yet it should never be needlessly done, or before being satisfied that the tooth is fully formed, and is out of the socket, and under the gum.
10136-8{_}30024{_}When assured on these points, the gum should be cut lengthwise, and from the top of the gum downwards to the tooth, in an horizontal direction, thus----, and for about half an inch in length.
10136-8{_}30025{_}The operation is then to be repeated in a transverse direction, cutting across the gum, in the centre of the first incision, and forming a cross, thus +.
10136-8{_}30026{_}The object of this double incision is to insure a retraction of the cut parts, and leave an open way for the tooth to start from--an advantage not to be obtained when only one incision is made; for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing, the opening reunites, and the operation has to be repeated.
10136-8{_}30027{_}That this operation is very little or not at all painful, is evidenced by the suddenness with which the infant falls asleep after the lancing, and awakes in apparently perfect health, though immediately before the use of the gum-lancet, the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions.
10136-8{_}30028{_}Convulsions, or Infantine Fits.
10136-8{_}30029{_}2519.
10136-8{_}30030{_}From their birth till after teething, infants are more or less subject or liable to sudden fits, which often, without any assignable cause, will attack the child in a moment, and while in the mother's arms; and which, according to their frequency, and the age and strength of the infant, are either slight or dangerous.
10136-8{_}30031{_}2520.
10136-8{_}30032{_}Whatever may have been the remote cause, the immediate one is some irritation of the nervous system, causing convulsions, or an effusion to the head, inducing coma.
10136-8{_}30033{_}In the first instance, the infant cries out with a quick, short scream, rolls up its eyes, arches its body backwards, its arms become bent and fixed, and the fingers parted; the lips and eyelids assume a dusky leaden colour, while the face remains pale, and the eyes open, glassy, or staring.
10136-8{_}30034{_}This condition may or may not be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth, and convulsive plunges of the arms.
10136-8{_}30035{_}The fit generally lasts from one to three minutes, when the child recovers with a sigh, and the relaxation of the body.
10136-8{_}30036{_}In the other case, the infant is attacked at once with total insensibility and relaxation of the limbs, coldness of the body and suppressed breathing; the eyes, when open, being dilated, and presenting a dim glistening appearance; the infant appearing, for the moment, to be dead.
10136-8{_}30037{_}2521.
10136-8{_}30038{_}_Treatment._-The first step in either case is, to immerse the child in a hot bath up to the chin; or if sufficient hot water cannot be procured to cover the body, make a hip-bath of what can be obtained; and, while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent position, with the right scoop up the water, and run it over the chest of the patient.
10136-8{_}30039{_}When sufficient water can be obtained, the spine should be briskly rubbed while in the bath; when this cannot be done, lay the child on the knees, and with the fingers dipped in brandy, rub the whole length of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes, and when restored to consciousness, give occasionally a teaspoonful of weak brandy and water or wine and water.
10136-8{_}30040{_}2522.
10136-8{_}30041{_}An hour after the bath, it may be necessary to give an aperient powder, possibly also to repeat the dose for once or twice every three hours; in which case the following prescription is to be employed.
10136-8{_}30042{_}Take of    Powdered scammony       6 grains.
10136-8{_}30043{_}Grey powder             6 grains.
10136-8{_}30044{_}Antimonial powder       4 grains.
10136-8{_}30045{_}Lump sugar             20 grains.
10136-8{_}30046{_}Mix thoroughly, and divide into three powders, which are to be taken as advised for an infant one year old; for younger or weakly infants, divide into four powders, and give as the other.
10136-8{_}30047{_}For thirst and febrile symptoms, give drinks of barley-water, or cold water, and every three hours put ten to fifteen drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a dessert-spoonful of either beverage.
10136-8{_}30048{_}THRUSH, AND ITS TREATMENT.
10136-8{_}30049{_}2523.
10136-8{_}30050{_}This is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject, and in whom alone it may be said to be a disease; for when thrush shows itself in adult or advanced life, it is not as a disease proper, but only as a symptom, or accessory, of some other ailment, generally of a chronic character, and should no more be classed as a separate affection than the petechae, or dark-coloured spots that appear in malignant measles, may be considered a distinct affection.
10136-8{_}30051{_}2524.
10136-8{_}30052{_}Thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, whereby there are formed small vesicles, or bladders, filled with a thick mucous secretion, which, bursting, discharge their contents, and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel.
10136-8{_}30053{_}To make this formal but unavoidable description intelligible, we must beg the reader's patience while we briefly explain terms that may appear to many so unmeaning, and make the pathology of thrush fully familiar.
10136-8{_}30054{_}2525.
10136-8{_}30055{_}The whole digestive canal, of which the stomach and bowels are only a part, is covered, from the lips, eyes, and ears downwards, with a thin glairy tissue, like the skin that lines the inside of an egg, called the mucous membrane; this membrane is dotted all over, in a state of health, by imperceptible points, called follicles, through which the saliva, or mucous secreted by the membrane, is poured out.
10136-8{_}30056{_}2526.
10136-8{_}30057{_}These follicles, or little glands, then, becoming enlarged, and filled with a congealed fluid, constitute thrush in its first stage; and when the child's lips and mouth appear a mass of small pearls, then, as these break and discharge, the second stage, or that of ulceration, sets in.
10136-8{_}30058{_}2527.
10136-8{_}30059{_}_Symptoms._--Thrush is generally preceded by considerable irritation, by the child crying and fretting, showing more than ordinary redness of the lips and nostrils, hot fetid breath, with relaxed bowels, and dark feculent evacuations; the water is scanty and high-coloured; whilst considerable difficulty in swallowing, and much thirst, are the other symptoms, which a careful observation of the little patient makes manifest.
10136-8{_}30060{_}2528.
10136-8{_}30061{_}The situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause is some irritation of the mucous membrane, and can proceed only from the nature and quality of the food.
10136-8{_}30062{_}Before weaning, this must be looked for in the mother, and the condition of the milk; after that time, in the crude and indigestible nature of the food given.
10136-8{_}30063{_}In either case, this exciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped.
10136-8{_}30064{_}When it proceeds from the mother, it is always best to begin by physicking the infant through the parent; that is to say, let the parent first take the medicine, which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk: this plan has the double object of benefiting the patient and, at the same time, correcting the state of the mother, and improving the condition of her milk.
10136-8{_}30065{_}In the other case, when the child is being fed by hand, then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given, and substituting farinaceous food, custards, blanc-mange, and ground-rice puddings.
10136-8{_}30066{_}2529.
10136-8{_}30067{_}As an aperient medicine for the mother, the best thing she can take is a dessert-spoonful of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day, in a cup of cold water; and every second day, for two or three times, an aperient pill.
10136-8{_}30068{_}2530.
10136-8{_}30069{_}As the thrush extends all over the mouth, throat, stomach, and bowels, the irritation to the child from such an extent of diseased surface is proportionately great, and before attempting to act on such a tender surface by opening medicine, the better plan is to soothe by an emollient mixture; and, for that purpose, let the following be prepared.
10136-8{_}30070{_}Take of    Castor oil                          2 drachms.
10136-8{_}30071{_}Sugar                               1 drachm.
10136-8{_}30072{_}Mucilage, or powdered gum Arabic    half a drachm.
10136-8{_}30073{_}Triturate till the oil is incorporated, then add slowly--    Mint-water            One ounce and a half   Laudanum              Ten drops  Half a teaspoonful three times a day, to an infant from one to two years old; a teaspoonful from two to three years old; and a dessertspoonful at any age over that time.
10136-8{_}30074{_}After two days' use of the mixture, one of the following powders should be given twice a day, accompanied with one dose daily of the mixture:--    Grey powder              20 grains.
10136-8{_}30075{_}Powdered rhubarb         15 grains.
10136-8{_}30076{_}Scammony                 10 grains.
10136-8{_}30077{_}Mix.
10136-8{_}30078{_}Divide into twelve powders, for one year; eight powders, from one to two; and six powders, from two to six years old.
10136-8{_}30079{_}After that age, double the strength, by giving the quantity of two powders at once.
10136-8{_}30080{_}2531.
10136-8{_}30081{_}It is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth for thrush; but it is always better to treat the disease constitutionally rather than locally.
10136-8{_}30082{_}The first steps, therefore, to be adopted are, to remove or correct the exciting cause--the mother's milk or food; allay irritation by a warm bath and the castor-oil mixture, followed by and conjoined with the powders.
10136-8{_}30083{_}2532.
10136-8{_}30084{_}To those, however, who wish to try the honey process, the best preparation to use is the following:-Rub down one ounce of honey with two drachms of tincture of myrrh, and apply it to the lips and mouth every four or six hours.
10136-8{_}30085{_}2533.
10136-8{_}30086{_}It is a popular belief, and one most devoutly cherished by many nurses and elderly persons, that everybody must, at some time of their life, between birth and death, have an attack of thrush, and if not in infancy, or prime of life, it will surely attack them on their death-bed, in a form more malignant than if the patient had been affected with the malady earlier; the black thrush with which they are then reported to be affected being, in all probability, the petechae or purple spots that characterize the worst form, and often the last stage, of typhoid fever.
10136-8{_}30087{_}2534.
10136-8{_}30088{_}In general, very little medicine is needed in this disease of the thrush--an alterative powder, or a little magnesia, given once or twice, being all, with the warm bath, that, in the great majority of cases, is needed to restore the mucous membrane to health.
10136-8{_}30089{_}As thrush is caused by an excess of heat, or over-action in the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels, whatever will counteract this state, by throwing the heat on the surface, must materially benefit, if not cure, the disease: and that means every mother has at hand, in the form of a _warm bath_.
10136-8{_}30090{_}After the application of this, a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing along the surface of the mucous membrane, is often all that is needed to throw the system into such a state as will effect its own cure.
10136-8{_}30091{_}This favourable state is indicated by an excessive flow of saliva, or what is called "dribbling," and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the bowels-a condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea, and checked as if a disease, but rather, for the day or two it continues, encouraged as a critical evacuant.
10136-8{_}30092{_}2535.
10136-8{_}30093{_}Should there be much debility in the convalescence, half a teaspoonful of stee wine, given twice a day in a little barley-water, will be found sufficient for all the purposes of a tonic.
10136-8{_}30094{_}This, with the precaution of changing the child's food, or, when it lives on the mother, of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet, and, by means of an antacid or aperient, improving the state of the secretion.
10136-8{_}30095{_}Such is all the treatment that this disease in general requires.
10136-8{_}30096{_}2536.
10136-8{_}30097{_}The class of diseases we are now approaching are the most important, both in their pathological features and in their consequences on the constitution, of any group or individual disease that assails the human body; and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame of childhood, are yet by no means confined to that period.
10136-8{_}30098{_}These are called Eruptive Fevers, and embrace chicken-pox, cow-pox, small-pox, scarlet fever, measles, milary fever, and erysipelas, or St. Anthony's fire.
10136-8{_}30099{_}2537.
10136-8{_}30100{_}The general character of all these is, that they are contagious, and, as a general rule, attack a person only once in his lifetime; that their chain of diseased actions always begins with fever, and that, after an interval of from one to four days, the fever is followed by an eruption of the skin.
10136-8{_}30101{_}CHICKEN-POX, OR GLASS-POX; AND COW-POX, OR VACCINATION.
10136-8{_}30102{_}2538.
10136-8{_}30103{_}CHICKEN-POX, or GLASS-POX, may, in strict propriety, be classed as a mild variety of small-pox, presenting all the mitigated symptoms of that formidable disease.
10136-8{_}30104{_}Among many physicians it is, indeed, classed as small-pox, and not a separate disease; but as this is not the place to discuss such questions, and as we profess to give only facts, the result of our own practical experience, we shall treat this affection of glass-pox or chicken-pox, as we ourselves have found it, as a distinct and separate disease.
10136-8{_}30105{_}2539.
10136-8{_}30106{_}Chicken-pox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by small-pox, with this difference, that, in the case of chicken-pox, each symptom is particularly slight.
10136-8{_}30107{_}The heat of body is much less acute, and the principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing, headache, coated tongue, and nausea, which sometimes amounts to vomiting.
10136-8{_}30108{_}After a term of general irritability, heat, and restlessness, about the fourth day, or between the third and fourth, an eruption makes its appearance over the face, neck, and body, in its first two stages closely resembling small-pox, with this especial difference, that whereas the pustules in small-pox have _flat_ and _depressed_ centres--an infallible characteristic of small-pox--the pustules in chicken-pox remain _globular_, while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to a straw-coloured liquid, which begins to exude and disappear about the eighth or ninth day, and, in mild cases, by the twelfth desquamates, or peels off entirely.
10136-8{_}30109{_}2540.
10136-8{_}30110{_}There can be no doubt that chicken-pox, like small-pox, is contagious, and under certain states of the atmosphere becomes endemic.
10136-8{_}30111{_}Parents should, therefore, avoid exposing young children to the danger of infection by taking them where it is known to exist, as chicken-pox, in weakly constitutions, or in very young children, may superinduce small-pox, the one disease either running concurrently with the other, or discovering itself as the other declines.
10136-8{_}30112{_}This, of course, is a condition that renders the case very hazardous, as the child has to struggle against two diseases at once, or before it has recruited strength from the attack of the first.
10136-8{_}30113{_}2541.
10136-8{_}30114{_}_Treatment_.--In all ordinary cases of chicken-pox--and it is very seldom it assumes any complexity--the whole treatment resolves itself into the use of the warm bath, and a course of gentle aperients.
10136-8{_}30115{_}The bath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the breathing difficult, or the heat and dryness of the skin, with the undeveloped rash beneath the surface, shows the necessity for its use.
10136-8{_}30116{_}2542.
10136-8{_}30117{_}As the pustules in chicken-pox very rarely run to the state of suppuration, as in the other disease, there is no fear of _pitting_ or disfigurement, except in very severe forms, which, however, happen so seldom as not to merit apprehension.
10136-8{_}30118{_}When the eruption subsides, however, the face may be washed with elder-flower water, and the routine followed which is prescribed in the convalescent state of small-pox.
10136-8{_}30119{_}2543.
10136-8{_}30120{_}COW-POX, properly speaking, is an artificial disease, established in a healthy body as a prophylactic, or preventive agent, against the more serious attack of small-pox, and is merely that chain of slight febrile symptoms and local irritation, consequent on the specific action of the lymph of the vaccination, in its action on the circulating system of the body.
10136-8{_}30121{_}This is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on mankind by the discovery of vaccination, not only as the preserver of the human features from a most loathsome disfigurement, but as a sanitary agent in the prolongation of life.
10136-8{_}30122{_}2544.
10136-8{_}30123{_}Fortunately the State has now made it imperative on all parents to have their children vaccinated before, or by the end of, the twelfth week; thus doing away, as far as possible, with the danger to public health proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents whose want of information on the subject makes them object to the employment of this specific preventive; for though vaccination has been proved _not_ to be _always_ an infallible guard against small-pox, the attack is always much lighter, should it occur, and is seldom, if indeed _ever_, fatal after the precaution of vaccination.
10136-8{_}30124{_}The best time to vaccinate a child is after the sixth and before the twelfth week, if it is in perfect health, but still earlier if small-pox is prevalent, and any danger exists of the infant taking the disease.
10136-8{_}30125{_}It is customary, and always advisable, to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two days before inserting the lymph in the arm; and should measles, scarlet fever, or any other disease arise during the progress of the pustule, the child, when recovered, should be _re-vaccinated_, and the lymph taken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes.
10136-8{_}30126{_}2545.
10136-8{_}30127{_}The disease of cow-pox generally takes twenty days to complete its course; in other words, the maturity and declension of the pustule takes that time to fulfil its several changes.
10136-8{_}30128{_}The mode of vaccination is either to insert the matter, or lymph, taken from a healthy child, under the cuticle in several places on both arms, or, which is still better, to make three slight scratches, or abrasions, with a lancet on one arm in this manner, ,,",, and work into the irritated parts the lymph, allowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting down the infant's sleeve; by this means absorption is insured, and the unnecessary pain of several pustules on both arms avoided.
10136-8{_}30129{_}No apparent change is observable by the eye for several days; indeed, not till the fourth, in many cases, is there any evidence of a vesicle; about the fifth day, however, a pink areola, or circle, is observed round one or all of the places, surrounding a small pearly vesicle or bladder.
10136-8{_}30130{_}This goes on deepening in hue till the seventh or eighth day, when the vesicle is about an inch in diameter, with a depressed centre; on the ninth the edges are elevated, and the surrounding part hard and inflamed.
10136-8{_}30131{_}The disease is now at its height, and the pustule should be opened, if not for the purpose of vaccinating other children, to allow the escape of the lymph, and subdue the inflammatory action.
10136-8{_}30132{_}After the twelfth day the centre is covered by a brown scab, and the colour of the swelling becomes darker, gradually declining in hardness and colour till the twentieth, when the scab falls, off, leaving a small pit, or cicatrix, to mark the seat of the disease, and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination.
10136-8{_}30133{_}2546.
10136-8{_}30134{_}In some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is excessive, and extremely painful, and the fever, about the ninth or tenth day, very high; the pustule, therefore, at that time, should sometimes be opened, the arm fomented every two hours with a warm bread poultice, and an aperient powder given to the infant.
10136-8{_}30135{_}MEASLES AND SCARLET FEVER, WITH THE TREATMENT OF BOTH.
10136-8{_}30136{_}Measles.
10136-8{_}30137{_}2547.
10136-8{_}30138{_}This much-dreaded disease, which forms the next subject in our series of infantine diseases, and which entails more evils on the health of childhood than any other description of physical suffering to which that age of life is subject, may be considered more an affection of the venous circulation, tending to general and local congestion, attended with a diseased condition of the blood, than either as a fever or an inflammation; and though generally classed before or after scarlet fever, is, in its pathology and treatment, irrespective of its after-consequences, as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be from another.
10136-8{_}30139{_}4548.
10136-8{_}30140{_}As we have already observed, measles are always characterized by the running at the nose and eyes, and great oppression of breathing; so, in the mode of treatment, two objects are to be held especially in view; first, to unload the congested state of the lungs,--the cause of the oppressed breathing; and, secondly, to act vigorously, both during the disease and afterwards, on the bowels.
10136-8{_}30141{_}At the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind, that though the patient in measles should on no account be kept unduly hot, more care than in most infantine complaints should be taken to guard the body from _cold_, or any abrupt changes of temperature.
10136-8{_}30142{_}With these special observations, we shall proceed to give a description of the disease, as recognized by its usual--  2549.
10136-8{_}30143{_}_Symptoms_, which commence with cold chills and flushes, lassitude, heaviness, pain in the head, and drowsiness, cough, hoarseness, and extreme difficulty of breathing, frequent sneezing, deduction or running at the eyes and nose, nausea, sometimes vomiting, thirst, a furred tongue; the pulse throughout is quick, and sometimes full and soft, at others hard and small, with other indications of an inflammatory nature.
10136-8{_}30144{_}2550.
10136-8{_}30145{_}On the third day, small red points make their appearance, first on the face and neck, gradually extending over the upper and lower part of the body.
10136-8{_}30146{_}On the fifth day, the vivid red of the eruption changes into a brownish hue; and, in two or three days more, the rash entirely disappears, leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin, which rubs off like dandriff.
10136-8{_}30147{_}At this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently comes on, which, being what is called "critical," should never be checked, unless seriously severe.
10136-8{_}30148{_}Measles sometimes assume a typhoid or malignant character, in which form the symptoms are all greatly exaggerated, and the case from the first becomes both doubtful and dangerous.
10136-8{_}30149{_}In this condition the eruption comes out sooner, and only in patches; and often, after showing for a few hours, suddenly recedes, presenting, instead of the usual florid red, a dark purple or blackish hue; a dark brown fur forms on the gums and mouth, the breathing becomes laborious, delirium supervenes, and, if unrelieved, is followed by coma; a fetid diarrhoea takes place, and the patient sinks under the congested state of the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain.
10136-8{_}30150{_}2551.
10136-8{_}30151{_}The unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever, the excessive heat and dryness of the skin, hurried and short breathing, and a particularly hard pulse.
10136-8{_}30152{_}The sequels, or after-consequences, of measles are, croup, bronchitis, mesenteric disease, abscesses behind the ear, ophthalmia, and glandular swellings in other parts of the body.
10136-8{_}30153{_}2552.
10136-8{_}30154{_}_Treatment_.--In the first place, the patient should be kept in a cool room, the temperature of which must be regulated to suit the child's feelings of comfort, and the diet adapted to the strictest principles of abstinence.
10136-8{_}30155{_}When the inflammatory symptoms are severe, bleeding, in some form, is often necessary, though, when adopted, it must be in the _first stage_ of the disease; and, if the lungs are the apprehended seat of the inflammation, two or more leeches, according to the age and strength of the patient, must be applied to the upper part of the chest, followed by a small blister; or the blister may be substituted for the leeches, the attendant bearing in mind, that the benefit effected by the blister can always be considerably augmented by plunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after applying the blister, and kept in the water for about two minutes.
10136-8{_}30156{_}And let it further be remembered, that this immersion of the feet in hot water may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease; and that, whenever the _head_ or _lungs_ are oppressed, relief will _always_ accrue from its sudden and brief employment.
10136-8{_}30157{_}When the symptoms commence with much shivering, and the skin early assumes a hot, dry character, the appearance of the rash will be facilitated, and all the other symptoms rendered milder, if the patient is put into a warm bath, and kept in the water for about three minutes.
10136-8{_}30158{_}Or, where that is not convenient, the following process, which will answer quite as well, can be substituted:--Stand the child, naked, in a tub, and, having first prepared several jugs of sufficiently warm water, empty them, in quick succession, over the patient's shoulders and body; immediately wrap in a hot blanket, and put the child to bed till it rouses from the sleep that always follows the effusion or bath.
10136-8{_}30159{_}This agent, by lowering the temperature of the skin, and opening the pores, producing a natural perspiration, and unloading the congested state of the lungs, in most cases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and a blister.
10136-8{_}30160{_}Whether any of these external means have been employed or not, the first internal remedies should commence with a series of aperient powders and a saline mixture, as prescribed in the following formularies; at the same time, as a beverage to quench the thirst, let a quantity of barley-water be made, slightly acidulated by the juice of an orange, and partially sweetened by some sugar-candy; and of which, when properly made and cold, let the patient drink as often as thirst, or the dryness of the mouth, renders necessary.
10136-8{_}30161{_}2553.
10136-8{_}30162{_}_Aperient Powders_.--Take of scammony and jalap, each 24 grains; grey powder and powdered antimony, each 18 grains.
10136-8{_}30163{_}Mix and divide into 12 powders, if for a child between two and four years of age; into 8 powders, if for a child between four and eight years of ago; and into 6 powders for between eight and twelve years.
10136-8{_}30164{_}One powder to be given, in a little jelly or sugar-and-water, every three or four hours, according to the severity of the symptoms.
10136-8{_}30165{_}2554.
10136-8{_}30166{_}_Saline Mixture_.--Take of mint-water, 6 ounces; powdered nitre, 20 grains; antimonial wine, 3 drachms; spirits of nitre, 2 drachms; syrup of saffron, 2 drachms.
10136-8{_}30167{_}Mix.
10136-8{_}30168{_}To children under three years, give a teaspoonful every two hours; from that age to six, a dessertspoonful at the same times; and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to children between six and twelve.
10136-8{_}30169{_}2555.
10136-8{_}30170{_}The object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but gentle action on the bowels; but, whenever it seems necessary to administer a stronger dose, and effect a brisk action on the digestive organs,--a course particularly imperative towards the close of the disease,--two of these powders given at once, according to the age, will be found to produce that effect; that is, two of the twelve for a child under four years, and two of the eight, and two of the six, according to the age of the patient.
10136-8{_}30171{_}2556.
10136-8{_}30172{_}When the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive, as it generally does towards night, a hot bran poultice, laid on the chest, will be always found highly beneficial.
10136-8{_}30173{_}The diet throughout must be light, and consist of farinaceous food, such as rice and sago puddings, beef-tea and toast; and not till convalescence sets in should hard or animal food be given.
10136-8{_}30174{_}2557.
10136-8{_}30175{_}When measles assume the malignant form, the advice just given must be broken through; food of a nutritious and stimulating character should be at once substituted, and administered in conjunction with wine, and even spirits, and the disease regarded and treated as a case of typhus.
10136-8{_}30176{_}But, as this form of measles is not frequent, and, if occurring, hardly likely to be treated without assistance, it is unnecessary to enter on the minutiae of its practice here.
10136-8{_}30177{_}What we have prescribed, in almost all cases, will be found sufficient to meet every emergency, without resorting to a multiplicity of agents.
10136-8{_}30178{_}2558.
10136-8{_}30179{_}The great point to remember in measles is, not to give up the treatment with the apparent subsidence of the disease, as the _after-consequences_ of measles are too often more serious, and to be more dreaded, than the measles themselves.
10136-8{_}30180{_}To guard against this danger, and thoroughly purify the system, after the subsidence of all the symptoms of the disease, a corrective course of medicine, and a regimen of exercise, should be adopted for some weeks after the cure of the disease.
10136-8{_}30181{_}To effect this, an active aperient powder should be given every three or four clays, with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mixture, with as much exercise, by walking, running after a hoop, or other bodily exertion, as the strength of the child and the state of the atmosphere will admit, the patient being, wherever possible, removed to a purer air as soon as convalescence warrants the change.
10136-8{_}30182{_}2559.
10136-8{_}30183{_}_Tonic Mixture_.--Take of infusion of rose-leaves, 6 ounces; quinine, 8 grains; diluted sulphuric acid, 15 drops.
10136-8{_}30184{_}Mix.
10136-8{_}30185{_}Dose, from half a teaspoonful up to a dessertspoonful, once a day, according to the ago of the patient.
10136-8{_}30186{_}Scarlatina, or Scarlet Fever.
10136-8{_}30187{_}2560.
10136-8{_}30188{_}Though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several forms, we shall keep to the one disease most generally mot with, the common or simple scarlet fever, which, in all cases, is characterized by an excessive heat on the skin, sore throat, and a peculiar speckled appearance of the tongue.
10136-8{_}30189{_}2561.
10136-8{_}30190{_}_Symptoms_.--Cold chills, shivering, nausea, thirst, hot skin, quick pulse, with difficulty of swallowing; the tongue is coated, presenting through its fur innumerable specks, the elevated papillae of the tongue, which gives it the speckled character, that, if not the invariable sign of scarlet fever, is only met with in cases closely analogous to that disease.
10136-8{_}30191{_}Between the _second_ and __third_ day, but most frequently on the _third_, a bright red efflorescence breaks out in patches on the face, neck, and back, from which it extends over the trunk and extremities, always showing thicker and deeper in colour wherever there is any pressure, such as the elbows, back, and hips; when the eruption is well out, the skin presents the appearance of a boiled lobster-shell.
10136-8{_}30192{_}At first, the skin is smooth, but, as the disease advances, perceptible roughness is apparent, from the elevation of the rash, or, more properly, the pores of the skin.
10136-8{_}30193{_}On the _fifth_ and _sixth_ days the eruption begins to decline, and by the _eighth_ has generally entirely disappeared.
10136-8{_}30194{_}During the whole of this period, there is, more or less, constant sore throat.
10136-8{_}30195{_}2562.
10136-8{_}30196{_}The _Treatment_ of scarlet fever is, in general, very simple.
10136-8{_}30197{_}Where the heat is great, and the eruption comes out with difficulty, or recedes as soon as it appears, the body should be sponged with cold vinegar-and-water, or tepid water, as in measles, poured over the chest and body, the patient being, as in that disease, wrapped in a blanket and put to bed, and the same powders and mixture ordered in measles administered, with the addition of a constant hot bran poultice round the throat, which should be continued from the first symptom till a day or two after the declension of the rash.
10136-8{_}30198{_}The same low diet and cooling drink, with the same general instructions, are to be obeyed in this as in the former disease.
10136-8{_}30199{_}2563.
10136-8{_}30200{_}When the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is much nausea, before employing the effusions of water, give the patient an emetic, of equal, parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial wine, in doses of from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, according to age.
10136-8{_}30201{_}By these means, nine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and expeditiously cured, especially if the temperature of the patient's room is kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees.
10136-8{_}30202{_}HOOPING-COUGH, CROUP, AND DIARRHOEA, WITH THEIR MODE OF TREATMENT.
10136-8{_}30203{_}Hooping-Cough.
10136-8{_}30204{_}2564.
10136-8{_}30205{_}THIS is purely a spasmodic disease, and is only infectious through the faculty of imitation, a habit that all children are remarkably apt to fall into; and even where adults have contracted hooping-cough, it has been from the same cause, and is as readily accounted for, on the principle of imitation, as that the gaping of one person will excite or predispose a whole party to follow the same spasmodic example.
10136-8{_}30206{_}If any one associates for a few days with a person who stammers badly, he will find, when released from his company, that the sequence of his articulation and the fluency of his speech are, for a time, gone; and it will be a matter of constant vigilance, and some difficulty, to overcome the evil of so short an association.
10136-8{_}30207{_}The manner in which a number of school-girls will, one after another, fall into a fit on beholding one of their number attacked with epilepsy, must be familiar to many.
10136-8{_}30208{_}These several facts lead us to a juster notion of how to treat this spasmodic disease.
10136-8{_}30209{_}Every effort should, therefore, be directed, mentally and physically, to break the chain of nervous action, on which the continuance of the cough depends.
10136-8{_}30210{_}2565.
10136-8{_}30211{_}_Symptoms._--Hooping-cough comes on with a slight oppression of breathing, thirst, quick pulse, hoarseness, and a hard, dry cough.
10136-8{_}30212{_}This state may exist without any change from one to two or three weeks before the peculiar feature of the disease-the _hoop_-sets in.
10136-8{_}30213{_}As the characteristics of this cough are known to all, it is unnecessary to enter here, physiologically, on the subject.
10136-8{_}30214{_}We shall, therefore, merely remark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or nose are favourable signs, and proceed to the  2566.
10136-8{_}30215{_}_Treatment_, which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea and vomiting.
10136-8{_}30216{_}For this purpose, give the child doses of ipecacuanha and antimonial wines, in equal parts, and quantities varying from half to one and a half teaspoonful once a day, or, when the expectoration is hard and difficult of expulsion, giving the following cough mixture every four hours.
10136-8{_}30217{_}Take of    Syrup of squills            1/2 ounce.
10136-8{_}30218{_}Antimonial wine               1 ounce.
10136-8{_}30219{_}Laudanum                     15 drops.
10136-8{_}30220{_}Syrup of Toulou             2 drachms.
10136-8{_}30221{_}Water                     1-1/2 ounce.
10136-8{_}30222{_}Mix.
10136-8{_}30223{_}The dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful.
10136-8{_}30224{_}When the cough is urgent, the warm bath is to be used, and either one or two leeches applied over the breastbone, or else a small blister laid on the lower part of the throat.
10136-8{_}30225{_}2567.
10136-8{_}30226{_}Such is the medical treatment of hooping-cough; but there is a moral regimen, based on the nature of the disease, which should never be omitted.
10136-8{_}30227{_}And, on the principle that a sudden start or diversion of the mind will arrest a person in the act of sneezing or gaping, so the like means should be adopted with the hooping-cough patient; and, in the first stage, before the _hooping_ has been added, the parent should endeavour to break the paroxysm of the cough by abruptly attracting the patient's attention, and thus, if possible, preventing the cough from reaching that height when the ingulp of air gives the hoop or crow that marks the disease; but when once that symptom has set in, it becomes still more necessary to endeavour, by even measures of intimidation, to break the spasmodic chain of the cough.
10136-8{_}30228{_}Exercise in the open air, when dry, is also requisite, and charge of scene and air in all cases is of absolute necessity, and may be adopted at any stage of the disease.
10136-8{_}30229{_}Croup.
10136-8{_}30230{_}2568.
10136-8{_}30231{_}This is by far the most formidable and fatal of all the diseases to which infancy and childhood are liable, and is purely an inflammatory affection, attacking that portion of the mucous membrane lining the windpipe and bronchial tubes, and from the effect of which a false or loose membrane is formed along the windpipe, resembling in appearance the finger of a glove suspended in the passage, and, consequently, terminating the life of the patient by suffocation; for, as the lower end grows together and becomes closed, no air can enter the lungs, and the child dies choked.
10136-8{_}30232{_}All dull, fat, and heavy children are peculiarly predisposed to this disease, and those with short necks and who make a wheezing noise in their natural breathing.
10136-8{_}30233{_}Croup is always sudden in its attack, and rapid in its career, usually proving fatal within three days; most frequently commences in the night, and generally attacking children between the ages of three and ten years.
10136-8{_}30234{_}Mothers should, therefore, be on their guard who have children predisposed to this disease, and immediately resort to the means hereafter advised.
10136-8{_}30235{_}2569.
10136-8{_}30236{_}_Symptoms_.--Languor and restlessness, hoarseness, wheezing, and short, dry cough, with occasional rattling in the throat during sleep, the child often plucking at its throat with its fingers; difficulty of breathing, which quickly becomes hard and laboured, causing great anxiety of the countenance, and the veins of the neck to swell and become knotted; the voice in speaking acquires a sharp, crowing, or croupy sound, while the inspirations have a harsh, metallic intonation.
10136-8{_}30237{_}After a few hours, a quantity of thick, ropy mucus is thrown out, hanging about the mouth, and causing suffocating fits of coughing to expel.
10136-8{_}30238{_}2570.
10136-8{_}30239{_}Treatment.--Place the child immediately in a hot bath up to the throat; and, on removal from the water, give an emetic of the antimonial or ipecacuanha wine, and, when the vomiting has subsided, lay a long blister down the front of the throat, and administer one of the following powders every twenty minutes to a child from three to six years of age.
10136-8{_}30240{_}2571.
10136-8{_}30241{_}Take of calomel, 12 grains; tartar emetic, 2 grains; lump sugar, 30 grains.
10136-8{_}30242{_}Mix accurately, and divide into 12 powders.
10136-8{_}30243{_}For a child from six to twelve years, divide into 6 powders, and give one every half-hour.
10136-8{_}30244{_}2572.
10136-8{_}30245{_}Should the symptoms remain unabated after a few hours, apply one or two leeches to the throat, and put mustard poultices to the foot and thighs, retaining them about eight minutes; and, in extreme cases, a mustard poultice to the spine between the shoulders, and at the same time rub mercurial ointment into the armpits and the angles of the jaws.
10136-8{_}30246{_}2573.
10136-8{_}30247{_}Such is a vigorous and reliable system of treatment in severe cases of croup; but, in the milder and more general form, the following abridgment will, in all probability, be all that will be required:--First, the hot bath; second, the emetic; third, a mustard plaster round the throat for five minutes; fourth, the powders; fifth, another emetic in six hours, if needed, and the powders continued without intermission while the urgency of the symptoms continues.
10136-8{_}30248{_}When relief has been obtained, these are to be discontinued, and a dose of senna tea given to act on the bowels.
10136-8{_}30249{_}Diarrhoea.
10136-8{_}30250{_}2574.
10136-8{_}30251{_}The diarrhoea with which children are so frequently affected, especially in infancy, should demand the nurse's immediate attention, and when the secretion, from its clayey colour, indicates an absence of bile, a powder composed of 3 grains of grey powder and 1 grain of rhubarb, should be given twice, with an interval of four hours between each dose, to a child from one to two years, and, a day or two afterwards, an aperient powder containing the same ingredients and quantities, with the addition of 2 or 3 grains of scammony.
10136-8{_}30252{_}For the relaxation consequent on an overloaded stomach, or acidity in the bowels, a little magnesia dissolved in milk should be employed two or three times a day.
10136-8{_}30253{_}2575.
10136-8{_}30254{_}When much griping and pain attend the diarrhoea, half a teaspoonful of Dalby's Carminative (the best of all patent medicines) should be given, either with or without a small quantity of castor oil to carry off the exciting cause.
10136-8{_}30255{_}2576.
10136-8{_}30256{_}For any form of diarrhoea that, by excessive action, demands a speedy correction, the most efficacious remedy that can be employed in all ages and conditions of childhood is the tincture of Kino, of which from 10 to 30 drops, mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon, are to be given every two or three hours till the undue action has been checked.
10136-8{_}30257{_}Often the change of diet to rice, milk, eggs, or the substitution of animal for vegetable food, or _vice versa_, will correct an unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea.
10136-8{_}30258{_}2577.
10136-8{_}30259{_}A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be kept in the house, and employed with advantage, whenever the child is in pain or griped, by dropping 5 grains of oil of aniseed and 2 of peppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a mortar, with a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder.
10136-8{_}30260{_}A small quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time, and always with benefit.

10136-8{_}30262{_}CHAPTER XLIII.
10136-8{_}30263{_}2578.
10136-8{_}30264{_}"Time," according to the old proverb, "is money;" and it may also, in many cases, and with equal truthfulness, be said to be life; for a few moments, in great emergencies, often turn the balance between recovery and death.
10136-8{_}30265{_}This applies more especially to all kinds of poisoning, fits, submersion in water, or exposure to noxious gases; and many accidents.
10136-8{_}30266{_}If people knew how to act during the interval that must necessarily elapse from the moment that a medical man is sent for until he arrives, many lives might be saved, which now, unhappily, are lost.
10136-8{_}30267{_}Generally speaking, however, nothing is done--all is confusion and fright; and the surgeon, on his arrival, finds that death has already seized its victim, who, had his friends but known a few rough rules for their guidance, might have been rescued.
10136-8{_}30268{_}We shall, therefore, in a series of papers, give such information as to the means to be employed in event of accidents, injuries, &c., as, by the aid of a gentleman of large professional experience, we are warranted in recommending.
10136-8{_}30269{_}List of Drugs, &c., necessary to carry out all Instructions.
10136-8{_}30270{_}2579.
10136-8{_}30271{_}We append at once A LIST OF DRUGS, &c., and a few PRESCRIPTIONS necessary to carry out all the instructions given in this series of articles.
10136-8{_}30272{_}It will be seen that they are few--they are not expensive; and by laying in a little stock of them, our instructions will be of instant value in all cases of accident, &c.--The drugs are--Antimonial Wine.

10136-8{_}30303{_}2581.
10136-8{_}30304{_}_Draught_.--Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water.
10136-8{_}30305{_}This draught is to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not take place.
10136-8{_}30306{_}2582.
10136-8{_}30307{_}_Clyster_.--Two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel.
10136-8{_}30308{_}2583.
10136-8{_}30309{_}_Liniments_.--1.
10136-8{_}30310{_}Equal parts of lime-water and linseed-oil well mixed together.
10136-8{_}30311{_}[Lime-water is made thus: Pour 6 pints of boiling water upon 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}30312{_}of lime; mix well together, and when cool, strain the liquid from off the lime which has fallen to the bottom, taking care to get it as clear as possible.]
10136-8{_}30313{_}2.
10136-8{_}30314{_}Compound camphor liniment.
10136-8{_}30315{_}2584.
10136-8{_}30316{_}_Lotions_.--1.
10136-8{_}30317{_}Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water.--2.
10136-8{_}30318{_}Mix 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}30319{_}of sal-ammoniac, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the same quantity of gin or whisky, in half a pint of water.
10136-8{_}30320{_}2585.
10136-8{_}30321{_}_Goulard Lotion_.--1 drachm of sugar of lead, 2 pints of rain-water, 2 teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine.
10136-8{_}30322{_}For inflammation of the eyes or elsewhere:--The better way of making Goulard Lotion, if for the eyes, is to add to 6 oz.
10136-8{_}30323{_}of distilled water, or water that has been well boiled, 1 drachm of the extract of lead.
10136-8{_}30324{_}2586.
10136-8{_}30325{_}_Opodeldoc_.--This lotion being a valuable application for sprains, lumbago, weakness of joints, &c., and it being difficult to procure either pure or freshly made, we give a recipe for its preparation.
10136-8{_}30326{_}Dissolve 1 oz.
10136-8{_}30327{_}of camphor in a pint of rectified spirits of wine; then dissolve 4 oz.
10136-8{_}30328{_}of hard white Spanish soap, scraped thin, in 4 oz.

10136-8{_}30332{_}Families who make black draught in quantity, and wish to preserve it for some time without spoiling, should add about 2 drachms of spirits of hartshorn to each pint of the strained mixture, the use of this drug being to prevent its becoming mouldy or decomposed.
10136-8{_}30333{_}A simpler and equally efficacious form of black draught is made by infusing 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}30334{_}of Alexandrian senna, 3 oz.
10136-8{_}30335{_}of Epsom salts, and 2 drachms of bruised ginger and coriander-seeds, for several hours in a pint of boiling water, straining the liquor, and adding either 2 drachms of sal-volatile or spirits of hartshorn to the whole, and giving 3 tablespoonfuls for a dose to an adult.
10136-8{_}30336{_}2588.
10136-8{_}30337{_}_Mixtures_--1.
10136-8{_}30338{_}_Aperient_.--Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea: take a quarter of the mixture as a dose, and repeat it in three or four hours if necessary.

10136-8{_}30348{_}2592.
10136-8{_}30349{_}_Pills_.--1.
10136-8{_}30350{_}Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills.
10136-8{_}30351{_}Dose for a full-grown person: two pills.--2.
10136-8{_}30352{_}Mix 5 grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth together, and make into two pills, the dose for a full-grown person.
10136-8{_}30353{_}2593.
10136-8{_}30354{_}_Powders_.--Mix a grain of calomel and 4 grains of powdered jalap together.
10136-8{_}30355{_}2594.
10136-8{_}30356{_}In all cases, the dose of medicines given is to be regulated by the age of the patient.
10136-8{_}30357{_}2595.
10136-8{_}30358{_}_Abernethy's Plan for making a Bread-and-Water Poultice_.--First scald out a basin; then having put in some boiling water, throw in coarsely-crumbled bread, and cover it with a plate.
10136-8{_}30359{_}When the bread has soaked up as much water as it will imbibe, drain off the remaining water, and there will be left a light pulp.
10136-8{_}30360{_}Spread it a third of an inch thick on folded linen, and apply it when of the temperature of a warm bath.
10136-8{_}30361{_}To preserve it moist, occasionally drop warm water on it.
10136-8{_}30362{_}2596.
10136-8{_}30363{_}_Linseed-Meal Poultice_.--"Scald your basin, by pouring a little hot water into it; then put a small quantity of finely-ground linseed-meal into the basin, pour a little hot water on it, and stir it round briskly until you have well incorporated them; add a little more meal and a little more water; then stir it again.
10136-8{_}30364{_}Do not let any lumps remain in the basin, but stir the poultice well, and do not be sparing of your trouble.
10136-8{_}30365{_}What you do next, is to take as much of it out of the basin as you may require, lay it on a piece of soft linen, and let it be about a quarter of an inch thick."--_Abernethy_.
10136-8{_}30366{_}2597.
10136-8{_}30367{_}_Mustard Poultice_.--Mix equal parts of dry mustard and linseed-meal in warm vinegar.
10136-8{_}30368{_}When the poultice is wanted weak, warm water may be used for the vinegar; and when it is required very strong, mustard alone, without any linseed-meal, is to be mixed with warm vinegar.
10136-8{_}30369{_}2598.
10136-8{_}30370{_}_An ordinary Blister_.--Spread a little blister compound on a piece of common adhesive plaster with the right thumb.
10136-8{_}30371{_}It should be put on just thickly enough to conceal the appearance of the plaster beneath.
10136-8{_}30372{_}The part from which a blister has been taken should be covered till it heals over with soft linen rags smeared with lard.
10136-8{_}30373{_}Baths and Fomentations.
10136-8{_}30374{_}2599.
10136-8{_}30375{_}All fluid applications to the body are exhibited either in a hot or cold form; and the object for which they are administered is to produce a stimulating effect over the entire, or a part, of the system; for the effect, though differently obtained, and varying in degree, is the same in principle, whether procured by hot or cold water.
10136-8{_}30376{_}2600.
10136-8{_}30377{_}_Heat_.--There are three forms in which heat is universally applied to the body,--that of the tepid, warm, and vapour bath; but as the first is too inert to be worth notice, and the last dangerous and inapplicable, except in public institutions, we shall confine our remarks to the really efficacious and always attainable one--the  2601.
10136-8{_}30378{_}_Warm and Hot Bath_.--These baths are used whenever there is congestion, or accumulation of blood in the internal organs, causing pain, difficulty of breathing, or stupor, and are employed, by their stimulating property, to cause a rush of blood to the surface, and, by unloading the great organs, produce a temporary inflammation in the skin, and so equalize the circulation.
10136-8{_}30379{_}The effect of the hot bath is to increase the fulness of the pulse, accelerate respiration, and excite perspiration.
10136-8{_}30380{_}In all inflammations of the stomach and bowels, the hot bath is of the utmost consequence; the temperature of the warm bath varies from 92° to 100°, and may be obtained by those who have no thermometer to test the exact heat, by mixing one measure of boiling with two of cold water.
10136-8{_}30381{_}2602.
10136-8{_}30382{_}_Fomentations_ are generally used to effect, in a part, the benefit produced on the whole body by the bath; to which a sedative action is occasionally given by the use of roots, herbs, or other ingredients; the object being to relieve the internal organ, as the throat, or muscles round a joint, by exciting a greater flow of blood to the skin _over_ the affected part.
10136-8{_}30383{_}As the real agent of relief is heat, the fomentation should always be as hot as it can comfortably be borne, and, to insure effect, should be repeated every half-hour.
10136-8{_}30384{_}Warm fluids are applied in order to render the swelling which accompanies inflammation less painful, by the greater readiness with which the skin yields, than when it is harsh and dry.
10136-8{_}30385{_}They are of various kinds; but the most simple, and oftentimes the most useful, that can be employed, is "Warm Water."
10136-8{_}30386{_}Another kind of fomentation is composed of dried poppyheads, 4 oz.
10136-8{_}30387{_}Break them to pieces, empty out the seeds, put them into 4 pints of water, boil for a quarter of an hour, then strain through a cloth or sieve, and keep the water for use.
10136-8{_}30388{_}Or, chamomile flowers, hemlock, and many other plants, may be boiled, and the part fomented with the hot liquor, by means of flannels wetted with the decoction.
10136-8{_}30389{_}2603.
10136-8{_}30390{_}_Cold_, when applied in excess to the body, drives the blood from the surface to the centre, reduces the pulse, makes the breathing hard and difficult, produces coma, and, if long continued, death.
10136-8{_}30391{_}But when medicinally used, it excites a reaction on the surface equivalent to a stimulating effect; as in some cases of fever, when the body has been sponged with cold water, it excites, by reaction, increased circulation on the skin.
10136-8{_}30392{_}Cold is sometimes used to keep up a repellent action, as, when local inflammation takes place, a remedy is applied, which, by its benumbing and astringent effect, causes the blood, or the excess of it in the part, to recede, and, by contracting the vessels, prevents the return of any undue quantity, till the affected part recovers its tone.
10136-8{_}30393{_}Such remedies are called _Lotions_, and should, when used, be applied with the same persistency as the fomentation; for, as the latter should be renewed as often as the heat passes off, so the former should be applied as often as the heat from the skin deprives the application of its cold.
10136-8{_}30394{_}2604.
10136-8{_}30395{_}_Poultices_ are only another form of fomentation, though chiefly used for abscesses.
10136-8{_}30396{_}The ingredient best suited for a poultice is that which retains heat the longest; of these ingredients, the best are linseed--meal, bran, and bread.
10136-8{_}30397{_}Bran sewed into a bag, as it can be reheated, will be found the cleanest and most useful; especially for sore throats.
10136-8{_}30398{_}How to Bleed.
10136-8{_}30399{_}2605.
10136-8{_}30400{_}In cases of great emergency, such as the strong kind of apoplexy, and when a surgeon cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable time, the life of the patient depends almost entirely upon the fact of his being bled or not.
10136-8{_}30401{_}We therefore give instructions how the operation of bleeding is to be performed, but caution the reader only to attempt it in cases of the greatest emergency.
10136-8{_}30402{_}Place a handkerchief or piece of tape rather but not too tightly round the arm, about three or four inches above the elbow.
10136-8{_}30403{_}This will cause the veins below to swell and become very evident.
10136-8{_}30404{_}If this is not sufficient, the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose.
10136-8{_}30405{_}There will now be seen, passing up the middle of the fore-arm, a vein which, just below the bend of the elbow, sends a branch inwards and outwards, each branch shortly joining another large vein.
10136-8{_}30406{_}It is from the _outer_ branch--that the person is to be bled.
10136-8{_}30407{_}The right arm is the one mostly operated on.
10136-8{_}30408{_}The operator should take the lancet in his right hand, between the thumb and first finger, place the thumb of his left hand on the vein below the part where he is going to bleed from, and then gently thrust the tip of the lancet into the vein, and, taking care not to push it too deeply, cut in a gently curved direction, thus and bring it out, point upwards, at about half an inch from the part of the vein into which he had thrust it.
10136-8{_}30409{_}The vein must be cut lengthways, and not across.
10136-8{_}30410{_}When sufficient blood has been taken away, remove the bandage from above the elbow, and place the thumb of the left hand firmly over the cut, until all the bleeding ceases.
10136-8{_}30411{_}A small pad of lint is then to be put over the cut, with a larger pad over it, and the two kept in their places by means of a handkerchief or linen roller bound pretty tightly over them and round the arm.
10136-8{_}30412{_}2606.
10136-8{_}30413{_}When a person is bled, he should always be in the standing, or at any rate in the sitting, position; for if, as is often the case, he should happen to faint, he can, in, most eases at least, easily be brought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back, and stopping the bleeding.
10136-8{_}30414{_}_This is of the greatest importance._ It has been recommended, for what supposed advantages we don't know, to bleed people when they are lying down.
10136-8{_}30415{_}Should a person, under these circumstances, faint, what could be done to bring him to again?
10136-8{_}30416{_}The great treatment of lowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed here.
10136-8{_}30417{_}It is in that position already, and cannot be placed lower than it at present is--except, as is most likely to be the case, under the ground.
10136-8{_}30418{_}2607.
10136-8{_}30419{_}BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE.--Many children, especially those of a sanguineous temperament, are subject to sudden discharges of blood from some part of the body; and as all such fluxes are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or pressure, such discharges, unless in excess, and when likely to produce debility, should not be rashly or too abruptly checked.
10136-8{_}30420{_}In general, these discharges are confined to the summer or spring months of the year, and follow pains in the head, a sense of drowsiness, languor, or oppression; and, as such symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood, the hemorrhage should, to a certain extent, be encouraged.
10136-8{_}30421{_}When, however, the bleeding is excessive, or returns too frequently, it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount.
10136-8{_}30422{_}For this purpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient, in most cases, to arrest the most active hemorrhage.
10136-8{_}30423{_}A wet towel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders, and placing the child in a recumbent posture, is often sufficient to effect the object; where, however, the effusion resists such simple means, napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet.
10136-8{_}30424{_}If, in spite of these means, the bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a few folds of lint, tied together by a piece of thread, must be pushed up the nostril from which the blood flows, to act as a plug and pressure on the bleeding vessel.
10136-8{_}30425{_}When the discharge has entirely ceased, the plug is to be pulled out by means of the thread.
10136-8{_}30426{_}To prevent a repetition of the hemorrhage, the body should be sponged every morning with cold water, and the child put under a course of steel wine, have open-air exercise, and, if possible, salt-water bathing.
10136-8{_}30427{_}For children, a key suddenly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes, will often immediately arrest a copious bleeding.
10136-8{_}30428{_}2608.
10136-8{_}30429{_}SPITTING OF BLOOD, or hemorrhage from the lungs, is generally known from blood from the stomach by its being of a brighter colour, and in less quantities than that, which is always grumous and mixed with the half-digested food.
10136-8{_}30430{_}In either case, rest should be immediately enjoined, total abstinence from stimulants, and a low, poor diet, accompanied with the horizontal position, and bottles of boiling water to the feet.
10136-8{_}30431{_}At the same time the patient should suck through a quill, every hour, half a wine-glass of water in which 10 or 15 drops of the elixir of vitriol has been mixed, and, till further advice has been procured, keep a towel wrung out of cold water on the chest or stomach, according to the seat of the hemorrhage.
10136-8{_}30432{_}Bites and Stings.
10136-8{_}30433{_}2609.
10136-8{_}30434{_}BITES AND STINGS may be divided into three kinds:--1.
10136-8{_}30435{_}Those of Insects.
10136-8{_}30436{_}2.
10136-8{_}30437{_}Those of Snakes.
10136-8{_}30438{_}3.
10136-8{_}30439{_}Those of Dogs and other Animals.
10136-8{_}30440{_}2610.
10136-8{_}30441{_}1.
10136-8{_}30442{_}_The Bites or Stings of Insects_, such as gnats, bees, wasps, &c., need cause very little alarm, and are, generally speaking, easily cured.
10136-8{_}30443{_}They are very serious, however, when they take place on some delicate part of the body, such as near the eye, or in the throat.
10136-8{_}30444{_}_The treatment_ is very simple in most cases; and consists in taking out the sting, if it is left behind, with a needle, and applying to the part a liniment made of finely-scraped chalk and olive-oil, mixed together to about the thickness of cream.
10136-8{_}30445{_}2611.
10136-8{_}30446{_}Bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is also of great use.
10136-8{_}30447{_}If the person feels faint, he should lie quietly on his back, and take a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water.
10136-8{_}30448{_}When the inside of the throat is the part stung, there is great danger of violent inflammation taking place.
10136-8{_}30449{_}In this case, from eight to twelve leeches should be immediately put to the outside of the throat, and when they drop off, the part to which they had been applied should be well fomented with warm water.
10136-8{_}30450{_}The inside of the throat is to be constantly gargled with salt and water.
10136-8{_}30451{_}Bits of ice are to be sucked.
10136-8{_}30452{_}Rubbing the face and hands well over with plain olive-oil, before going to bed, will often keep gnats and musquitoes from biting during the night.
10136-8{_}30453{_}Strong scent, such as eau-de-Cologne, will have the same effect.
10136-8{_}30454{_}2612.
10136-8{_}30455{_}2.
10136-8{_}30456{_}_Bites of Snakes_.--These are much more dangerous than the preceding, and require more powerful remedies.
10136-8{_}30457{_}The bites of the different kinds of snakes do not all act alike, but affect people in different ways.--_Treatment of the part bitten_.
10136-8{_}30458{_}The great thing is to prevent the poison getting into the blood; and, if possible, to remove the whole of it at once from the body.
10136-8{_}30459{_}A pocket-handkerchief, a piece of tape or cord, or, in fact, of anything that is at hand, should be tied tightly round the part of the body bitten; if it be the leg or arm, immediately _above_ the bite, and between it and the heart.
10136-8{_}30460{_}The bite should then be sucked several times by any one who is near.
10136-8{_}30461{_}There is no danger in this, provided the person who does it has not got the skin taken off any part of his mouth.
10136-8{_}30462{_}What has been sucked into the mouth should be immediately spit out again.
10136-8{_}30463{_}But if those who are near have sufficient nerve for the operation, and a suitable instrument, they should cut out the central part bitten, and then bathe the wound for some time with warm water, to make it bleed freely.
10136-8{_}30464{_}The wound should afterwards be rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic, or, what is better, a solution of this--60 grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water--should be dropped into it.
10136-8{_}30465{_}The band should be kept on the part during the whole of the time that these means are being adopted.
10136-8{_}30466{_}The wound should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water.
10136-8{_}30467{_}The best plan, however, to be adopted, if it can be managed, is the following:--take a common wine-glass, and, holding it upside down, put a lighted candle or a spirit-lamp into it for a minute or two.
10136-8{_}30468{_}This will take out the air.
10136-8{_}30469{_}Then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part, and it will become attached, and hold on to the flesh.
10136-8{_}30470{_}The glass being nearly empty, the blood containing the poison will, in consequence, flow into it from the wound of its own accord.
10136-8{_}30471{_}This process should be repeated three or four times, and the wound sucked, or washed with warm water, before each application of the glass.
10136-8{_}30472{_}As a matter of course, when the glass is removed, all the blood should be washed out of it before it is applied again.--_Constitutional Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30473{_}There is mostly at first great depression of strength in these cases, and it is therefore requisite to give some stimulant; a glass of hot brandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, is the best that can be given.
10136-8{_}30474{_}When the strength has returned, and if the patient has not already been sick, a little mustard in hot water should be given, to make him so.
10136-8{_}30475{_}If, on the other hand, as is often the case, the vomiting is excessive, a large mustard poultice should be placed over the stomach, and a grain of solid opium swallowed in the form of a pill, for the purpose of stopping it.
10136-8{_}30476{_}Only one of these pills should be given by a non-professional person.
10136-8{_}30477{_}In all cases of bites from snakes, send for a surgeon as quickly as possible, and act according to the above directions until he arrives.
10136-8{_}30478{_}If he is within any reasonable distance, content yourself by putting on the band, sucking the wound, applying the glass, and, if necessary, giving a little brandy-and-water.
10136-8{_}30479{_}2613.
10136-8{_}30480{_}3.
10136-8{_}30481{_}_Bites of Dogs_.--For obvious reasons, these kinds of bites are more frequently met with than those of snakes.
10136-8{_}30482{_}_The treatment_ is the same as that for snake-bites, more especially that of the bitten part.
10136-8{_}30483{_}The majority of writers on the subject are in favour of keeping the wound open as long as possible.
10136-8{_}30484{_}This may be done by putting a few beans on it, and then by applying a large linseed-meal poultice over them.
10136-8{_}30485{_}Injuries and Accidents to Bones.
10136-8{_}30486{_}2614.
10136-8{_}30487{_}_Dislocation of Bones_.--When the end of a bone is pushed out of its natural position, it is said to be dislocated.
10136-8{_}30488{_}This may be caused by violence, disease, or natural weakness of the parts about a joint.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30489{_}Deformity about the joint, with unnatural prominence at one part, and depression at another.
10136-8{_}30490{_}The limb may be shorter or longer than usual, and is stiff and unable to be moved, differing in these last two respects from a broken limb, which is mostly shorter, never longer, than usual, and which is always more movable.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30491{_}So much practical science and tact are requisite in order to bring a dislocated bone into its proper position again, that we strongly advise the reader never to interfere in these cases; unless, indeed, it is altogether impossible to obtain the services of a surgeon.
10136-8{_}30492{_}But because any one of us may very possibly be placed in that emergency, we give a few rough rules for the reader's guidance.
10136-8{_}30493{_}In the first place make the joint, from which the bone has been displaced, perfectly steady, either by fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands; then pull the dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from which it has been thrust, so that, if it moves at all from its unnatural position, it may have the best chance of returning to its proper place.
10136-8{_}30494{_}Do not, however, pull or press against the parts too violently, as you may, perhaps, by doing so, rupture blood-vessels, and produce most serious consequences.
10136-8{_}30495{_}When you _do_ attempt to reduce a dislocated bone, do it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place, every hour making the operation more difficult.
10136-8{_}30496{_}When the patient is very strong, he may be put into a warm bath until he feels faint, or have sixty drops of antimonial wine given him every ten minutes until he feels sickish.
10136-8{_}30497{_}These two means are of great use in relaxing the muscles.
10136-8{_}30498{_}If the bone has been brought back again to its proper place, keep it there by means of bandages; and if there is much pain about the joint, apply a cold lotion to it, and keep it perfectly at rest.
10136-8{_}30499{_}The lotion should be, a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract, and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, mixed in a pint of water.
10136-8{_}30500{_}Leeches are sometimes necessary.
10136-8{_}30501{_}Unless the local pain, or general feverish symptoms, are great, the patient's diet should be the same as usual.
10136-8{_}30502{_}Dislocations may be reduced a week, or even a fortnight, after they have taken place.
10136-8{_}30503{_}As, therefore, although the sooner a bone is reduced the better, there is no very great emergency, and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or too violent treatment, it is always better for people in these cases to do too little than too much; inasmuch as the good which has not yet may still be done, whereas the evil that _has_ been done cannot so easily be undone.
10136-8{_}30504{_}2615.
10136-8{_}30505{_}FRACTURES OF BONES.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30506{_}1.
10136-8{_}30507{_}Deformity of the part.
10136-8{_}30508{_}2.
10136-8{_}30509{_}Unnatural looseness.
10136-8{_}30510{_}3.
10136-8{_}30511{_}A grating sound when the two ends of the broken bone are rubbed together.
10136-8{_}30512{_}4.
10136-8{_}30513{_}Loss of natural motion and power.
10136-8{_}30514{_}In some cases there is also shortening of the limb.--Fracture takes place from several causes, as a fall, a blow, a squeeze, and sometimes from the violent action of muscles.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30515{_}In cases where a surgeon cannot be procured immediately after the accident, the following general rules are offered for the reader's guidance:--The broken limb should be placed and kept as nearly as possible in its natural position.
10136-8{_}30516{_}This is to be done by first pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite directions, until the limb becomes as long as the opposite one, and then by applying a splint, and binding it to the part by means of a roller.
10136-8{_}30517{_}When there is no deformity, the pulling is of course unnecessary.
10136-8{_}30518{_}If there is much swelling about the broken part, a cold lotion is to be applied.
10136-8{_}30519{_}This lotion (_which we will call Lotion No.
10136-8{_}30520{_}1_) may be thus made:--Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water.
10136-8{_}30521{_}When the leg or arm is broken, always, if possible, get it to the same length and form as the opposite limb.
10136-8{_}30522{_}The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet.
10136-8{_}30523{_}When a broken limb is deformed, and a particular muscle is on the stretch, place the limb in such a position as will relax it.
10136-8{_}30524{_}This will in most cases cure the deformity.
10136-8{_}30525{_}Brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water, are to be given when the patient is faint.
10136-8{_}30526{_}Surgical aid should, of course, be procured as soon as possible.
10136-8{_}30527{_}2616.
10136-8{_}30528{_}JOINTS, INJURIES TO.--All kinds of injuries to joints, of whatever description, require particular attention, in consequence of the violent inflammations which are so liable to take place in these parts of the body, and which do so much mischief in a little time.
10136-8{_}30529{_}The joint injured should always be kept perfectly at rest; and when it is very painful, and the skin about it red, swollen, hot, and shining, at the same time that the patient has general feverish symptoms, such as great thirst and headache--leeches, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations, are to be applied; the No.
10136-8{_}30530{_}1 pills above-mentioned are to be given (two are a dose for a grown person) with a black draught three hours afterwards.
10136-8{_}30531{_}Give also two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture every four hours, and keep the patient on low diet.
10136-8{_}30532{_}When the injury and swelling are not very great, warm applications, with rest, low diet, and a dose of aperient medicine, will be sufficient.
10136-8{_}30533{_}When a joint has received a penetrating wound, it will require the most powerful treatment, and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon.
10136-8{_}30534{_}The patient's friends will have to use their own judgment to a great extent in these and in many other cases, as to when leeches, fever-mixture, &c., are necessary.
10136-8{_}30535{_}A universal rule, however, without a single exception, _is always to rest a joint well_ after it has been injured in any way whatever, to purge the patient, and to keep him on low diet, without beer, unless he has been a very great drinker indeed, in which case he may still be allowed to take a little; for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed to in excess be all taken away at once, he is very likely to have an attack of delirium tremens.
10136-8{_}30536{_}The quantity given should not, however, be much--say a pint, or, at the most, a pint and a half a day.
10136-8{_}30537{_}Rubbing the joint with opodeldoc, or the application of a blister to it, is of great service in taking away the thickenings, which often remain after all heat, pain, and redness have left an injured joint.
10136-8{_}30538{_}Great care should be observed in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured.
10136-8{_}30539{_}When the shoulder-joint is the one injured, the arm should be bound tightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller, and the elbow raised; when the elbow, it should be kept raised in the straight position, on a pillow; when the wrist, it should be raised on the chest, and suspended in a sling; when the knee, it should be kept in the straight position; and, lastly, when the ankle, it should be a little raised on a pillow.
10136-8{_}30540{_}2617.
10136-8{_}30541{_}BRUISES, LACERATIONS, AND CUTS.--Wherever the bruise may be, or however swollen or discoloured the skin may become, two or three applications of the _extract of lead_, kept to the part by means of lint, will, in an hour or little more, remove all pain, swelling, and tenderness.
10136-8{_}30542{_}Simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to be placed in their exact situation, drawn close together, and secured there by one or two slips of adhesive plaster.
10136-8{_}30543{_}When the wound, however, is jagged, or the flesh or cuticle lacerated, the parts are to be laid as smooth and regular as possible, and a piece of lint, wetted in the _extract of lead_, laid upon the wound, and a piece of greased lint placed above it to prevent the dressing sticking; the whole covered over to protect from injury, and the part dressed in the same manner once a day till the cure is effected.
10136-8{_}30544{_}2618.
10136-8{_}30545{_}BRUISES AND THEIR TREATMENT.--The best application for a bruise, be it large or small, is moist warmth; therefore, a warm bread-and-water poultice in hot moist flannels should be put on, as they supple the skin.
10136-8{_}30546{_}If the bruise be very severe, and in the neighbourhood of a joint, it will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised part, and afterwards a poultice.
10136-8{_}30547{_}But leeches should not be put on young children.
10136-8{_}30548{_}If the bruised part be the knee or the ankle, walking should not be attempted till it can be performed without pain.
10136-8{_}30549{_}Inattention to this point often lays the foundation for serious mischief in these joints, especially in the case of scrofulous persons.
10136-8{_}30550{_}In all conditions of bruises occurring in children, whether swellings or abrasions, no remedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pure extract of lead applied to the part.
10136-8{_}30551{_}Burns and Scalds.
10136-8{_}30552{_}2619.
10136-8{_}30553{_}BURNS AND SCALDS being essentially the same in all particulars, and differing only in the manner of their production, may be spoken of together.
10136-8{_}30554{_}As a general rule, scalds are less severe than burns, because the heat of water, by which scalds are mostly produced, is not, even when it is boiling, so intense as that of flame; oil, however, and other liquids, whose boiling-point is high, produce scalds of a very severe nature.
10136-8{_}30555{_}Burns and scalds have been divided into three classes.
10136-8{_}30556{_}The first class comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial, and merely reddens the skin; the second, where the injury is greater, and we get little bladders containing a fluid (called serum) dotted over the affected part; in the third class we get, in the case of burns, a charring, and in that of scalds, a softening or pulpiness, perhaps a complete and immediate separation of the part.
10136-8{_}30557{_}This may occur at once, or in the course of a little time.
10136-8{_}30558{_}The pain from the second kind of burns is much more severe than that in the other two, although the danger, as a general rule, is less than it is in the third class.
10136-8{_}30559{_}These injuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than when they happen on the arms or legs.
10136-8{_}30560{_}The danger arises more from the extent of surface that is burnt than from the depth to which the burn goes.
10136-8{_}30561{_}This rule, of course, has certain exceptions; because a small burn on the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more extensive but superficial one on the arm or leg.
10136-8{_}30562{_}When a person's clothes are in flames, the best way of extinguishing them is to wind a rug, or some thick material, tightly round the whole of the body.
10136-8{_}30563{_}2620.
10136-8{_}30564{_}_Treatment of the First Class of Burns and Scalds_.--_Of the part affected_.--Cover it immediately with a good coating of common flour, or cotton-wool with flour dredged well into it.
10136-8{_}30565{_}The great thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air.
10136-8{_}30566{_}The part will shortly get well, and the skin may or may not peel off.--_Constitutional Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30567{_}If the burn or scald is not extensive, and there is no prostration of strength, this is very simple, and consists in simply giving a little aperient medicine--pills (No.
10136-8{_}30568{_}2), as follows:--Mix 5 grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth, and make into two pills--the dose for a full-grown person.
10136-8{_}30569{_}Three hours after the pills give a black draught.
10136-8{_}30570{_}If there are general symptoms of fever, such as hot skin, thirst, headache, &c. &c., two tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture are to be given every four hours.
10136-8{_}30571{_}The fever-mixture, we remind our readers, is made thus:-Mix a drachm of powdered nitro, 2 drachms of carbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine, and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitro, in half a pint of water.
10136-8{_}30572{_}2621.
10136-8{_}30573{_}_Second Class.
10136-8{_}30574{_}Local Treatment_.--As the symptoms of these kinds of burns are more severe than those of the first class, so the remedies appropriate to them are more powerful.
10136-8{_}30575{_}Having, as carefully as possible, removed the clothes from the burnt surface, and taking care not to break the bladders, spread the following liniment (No.
10136-8{_}30576{_}1) on a piece of linen or lint--not the _fluffy_ side--and apply it to the part: the liniment should be equal parts of lime-water and linseed-oil, well mixed.
10136-8{_}30577{_}If the burn is on the trunk of the body, it is better to use a warm linseed-meal poultice.
10136-8{_}30578{_}After a few days dress the wound with Turner's cerate.
10136-8{_}30579{_}If the burn is at the bend of the elbow, place the arm in the _straight_ position; for if it is _bent_, the skin, when healed, will be contracted, and the arm, in all probability, always remain in the same un natural position.
10136-8{_}30580{_}This, indeed, applies to all parts of the body; therefore, always place the part affected in the most _stretched_ position possible.--_Constitutional Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30581{_}The same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class, only it must be more powerful.
10136-8{_}30582{_}Stimulants are move often necessary, but must be given with great caution.
10136-8{_}30583{_}If, as is often the case, there is great irritability and restlessness, a dose of opium (paregoric, in doses of from sixty to a hundred drops, according to age, is best) is of great service.
10136-8{_}30584{_}The feverish symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever mixture.
10136-8{_}30585{_}A drink made of about a tablespoonful of cream of tartar and a little lemon-juice, in a quart of warm water, allowed to cool, is a very nice one in these cases.
10136-8{_}30586{_}The diet throughout should not be too low, especially if there is much discharge from the wound.
10136-8{_}30587{_}After a few days it is often necessary to give wine, ammonia, and strong beef-tea.
10136-8{_}30588{_}These should be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark, and the pulse weak and frequent.
10136-8{_}30589{_}If there should be, after the lapse of a week or two, pain over one particular part of the belly, a blister should be put on it, and a powder of mercury and chalk-grey powder, and Dover's powder (two grains of the former and five of the latter) given three times a day.
10136-8{_}30590{_}Affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a consequence of these kinds of burns, but no one who is not a medical man can treat them.
10136-8{_}30591{_}2622.
10136-8{_}30592{_}_Third Class_.--These are so severe as to make it impossible for a non-professional person to be of much service in attending to them.
10136-8{_}30593{_}When they occur, a surgeon should always be sent for.
10136-8{_}30594{_}Until he arrives, however, the following treatment should be adopted:--Place the patient full-length on his back, and keep him warm.
10136-8{_}30595{_}Apply fomentations of flannels wrung out of boiling water and sprinkled with spirits of turpentine to the part, and give wine and sal-volatile in such quantities as the prostration of strength requires; always bearing in mind the great fact that you have to steer between two quicksands--death from present prostration and death from future excitement, which will always be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants given.
10136-8{_}30596{_}Give, therefore, only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in the body.
10136-8{_}30597{_}2623.
10136-8{_}30598{_}CONCUSSION OF BRAIN--STUNNING.--This may be caused by a blow or a fall.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30599{_}Cold skin; weak pulse; almost total insensibility; slow, weak breathing; pupil of eye sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller, than natural; inability to move; unwillingness to answer when spoken to.
10136-8{_}30600{_}These symptoms come on directly after the accident.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30601{_}Place the patient quietly on a warm bed, send for a surgeon, _and do nothing else for the first four or six hours_.
10136-8{_}30602{_}After this time the skin will become hot, the pulse full, and the patient feverish altogether.
10136-8{_}30603{_}If the surgeon has not arrived by the time these symptoms have set in, shave the patient's head, and apply the following lotion (No.
10136-8{_}30604{_}2): Mix half an ounce of sal-ammoniac, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the same quantity of gin or whisky, in half a pint of water.
10136-8{_}30605{_}Then give this pill (No.
10136-8{_}30606{_}1); Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills.
10136-8{_}30607{_}Give a black draught three hours after the pill, and two tablespoonfuls of the above-mentioned fever-mixture every four hours.
10136-8{_}30608{_}Keep on low diet.
10136-8{_}30609{_}Leeches are sometimes to be applied to the head.
10136-8{_}30610{_}These cases are often followed by violent inflammation of the brain.
10136-8{_}30611{_}They can, therefore, only be attended to properly throughout by a surgeon.
10136-8{_}30612{_}The great thing for people to do in these cases is--nothing; contenting themselves with putting the patient to bed, and waiting the arrival of a surgeon.
10136-8{_}30613{_}2624.
10136-8{_}30614{_}THE CHOLERA AND AUTUMNAL COMPLAINTS.--To oppose cholera, there seems no surer or better means than cleanliness, sobriety, and judicious ventilation.
10136-8{_}30615{_}Where there is dirt, that is the place for cholera; where windows and doors are kept most jealously shut, there cholera will find easiest entrance; and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the hot days of autumn are actually courting death.
10136-8{_}30616{_}To repeat it, cleanliness, sobriety, and free ventilation almost always defy the pestilence; but, in case of attack, immediate recourse should be had to a physician.
10136-8{_}30617{_}The faculty say that a large number of lives have been lost, in many seasons, solely from delay in seeking medical assistance.
10136-8{_}30618{_}They even assert that, taken early, the cholera is by no means a fatal disorder.
10136-8{_}30619{_}The copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent authority.
10136-8{_}30620{_}Other autumnal complaints there are, of which diarrhoea is the worst example.
10136-8{_}30621{_}They come on with pain, flatulence, sickness, with or without vomiting, followed by loss of appetite, general lassitude, and weakness.
10136-8{_}30622{_}If attended to at the first appearance, they may soon be conquered; for which purpose it is necessary to assist nature in throwing off the contents of the bowels, which may be one by means of the following prescription:--Take of calomel 3 grains, rhubarb 8 grains; mix and take it in a little honey or jelly, and repeat the dose three times, at the intervals of four or five hours.
10136-8{_}30623{_}The next purpose to be answered is the defence of the lining membrane of the intestines from their acrid contents, which will be best effected by drinking copiously of linseed tea, or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on quince-seeds, which are of a very mucilaginous nature; or, what is still better, full draughts of whey.
10136-8{_}30624{_}If the complaint continue after these means have been employed, some astringent or binding medicine will be required, as the subjoined:--Take of prepared chalk 2 drachms, cinnamon-water 7 oz., syrup of poppies 1 oz.
10136-8{_}30625{_}; mix, and take 3 tablespoonfuls every four hours.
10136-8{_}30626{_}Should this fail to complete the cure, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}30627{_}of tincture of catechu, or of kino, may be added to it, and then it will seldom fail; or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone, with a little water, every three hours, till the diarrhoea is checked.
10136-8{_}30628{_}While any symptoms of derangement are present, particular attention must be paid to the diet, which should be of a soothing, lubricating, and light nature, as instanced in veal or chicken broth, which should contain but little salt.
10136-8{_}30629{_}Rice, batter, and bread puddings will be generally relished, and be eaten with advantage; but the stomach is too much impaired to digest food of a more solid nature.
10136-8{_}30630{_}Indeed, we should give that organ, together with the bowels, as little trouble as possible, while they are so incapable of acting in their accustomed manner.
10136-8{_}30631{_}Much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of taking tincture of rhubarb, which is almost certain of aggravating that species of disorder of which we have now treated; for it is a spirit as strong as brandy, and cannot fail of producing harm upon a surface which is rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile.
10136-8{_}30632{_}But our last advice is, upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are above detailed, have _immediate_ recourse to a doctor, where possible.
10136-8{_}30633{_}2625.
10136-8{_}30634{_}TO CURE A COLD.--Put a large teacupful of linseed, with 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}30635{_}of sun raisins and 2 oz.
10136-8{_}30636{_}of stick liquorice, into 2 quarts of soft water, and let it simmer over a slow fire till reduced to one quart; add to it 1/4 lb.
10136-8{_}30637{_}of pounded sugar-candy, a tablespoonful of old rum, and a tablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice.
10136-8{_}30638{_}The rum and vinegar should be added as the decoction is taken; for, if they are put in at first, the whole soon becomes flat and less efficacious.
10136-8{_}30639{_}The dose is half a pint, made warm, on going to bed; and a little may be taken whenever the cough is troublesome.
10136-8{_}30640{_}The worst cold is generally cured by this remedy in two or three days; and, if taken in time, is considered infallible.
10136-8{_}30641{_}2626.
10136-8{_}30642{_}COLD ON THE CHEST.--A flannel dipped in boiling water, and sprinkled with turpentine, laid on the chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness.
10136-8{_}30643{_}2627.
10136-8{_}30644{_}SUBSTANCES IN THE EYE.--To remove fine particles of gravel, lime, &c., the eye should be syringed with lukewarm water till free from them.
10136-8{_}30645{_}Be particular not to worry the eye, under the impression that the substance is still there, which the enlargement of some of the minute vessels makes the patient believe is actually the case.
10136-8{_}30646{_}2628.
10136-8{_}30647{_}SORE EYES.--Incorporate thoroughly, in a glass mortar or vessel, one part of strong citron ointment with three parts of spermaceti ointment.
10136-8{_}30648{_}Use the mixture night and morning, by placing a piece of the size of a pea in the corner of the eye affected, only to be used in cases of chronic or long-standing inflammation of the organ, or its lids.
10136-8{_}30649{_}2629.
10136-8{_}30650{_}LIME IN THE EYE.--Bathe the eye with a little weak vinegar-and-water, and carefully remove any little piece of lime which may be seen, with a feather.
10136-8{_}30651{_}If any lime has got entangled in the eyelashes, carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in vinegar-and-water.
10136-8{_}30652{_}Violent inflammation is sure to follow; a smart purge must be therefore administered, and in all probability a blister must be applied on the temple, behind the ear, or nape of the neck.
10136-8{_}30653{_}2630.
10136-8{_}30654{_}STYE IN THE EYE.--Styes are little abscesses which form between the roots of the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a small pea.
10136-8{_}30655{_}The best way to manage them is to bathe them frequently with warm water, or in warm poppy-water, if very painful.
10136-8{_}30656{_}When they have burst, use an ointment composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti, well rubbed together, and smear along the edge of the eyelid.
10136-8{_}30657{_}Give a grain or two of calomel with 5 or 8 grains of rhubarb, according to the age of the child, twice a week.
10136-8{_}30658{_}The old-fashioned and apparently absurd practice of rubbing the stye with a ring, is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of medicinal application; though the number of times it is rubbed, or the quality of the ring and direction of the strokes, has nothing to do with its success.
10136-8{_}30659{_}The pressure and the friction excite the vessels of the part, and cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eyelash.
10136-8{_}30660{_}The edge of the nail will answer as well as a ring.
10136-8{_}30661{_}2631.
10136-8{_}30662{_}INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS.--The following ointment has been found very beneficial in inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the eyelids:--Take of prepared calomel, 1 scruple; spermaceti ointment, 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}30663{_}Mix them well together in a glass mortar; apply a small quantity to each corner of the eye every night and morning, and also to the edges of the lids, if they are affected.
10136-8{_}30664{_}If this should not eventually remove the inflammation, elder-flower water may be applied three or four times a day, by means of an eye-cup.
10136-8{_}30665{_}The bowels should be kept in a laxative state, by taking occasionally a quarter of an ounce of the Cheltenham or Epsom salts.
10136-8{_}30666{_}2632.
10136-8{_}30667{_}FASTING.--It is said by many able physicians that fasting is a means of removing incipient disease, and of restoring the body to its customary healthy sensations.
10136-8{_}30668{_}Howard, the celebrated philanthropist (says a writer), used to fast one day in every week.
10136-8{_}30669{_}Napoleon, when he felt his system unstrung, suspended his wonted repast, and took his exercise on horseback.
10136-8{_}30670{_}Fits.
10136-8{_}30671{_}2633.
10136-8{_}30672{_}Fits come on so suddenly, often without even the slightest warning, and may prove fatal so quickly, that all people should be acquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment, as a few moments, more or less, will often decide the question between life and death.
10136-8{_}30673{_}The treatment, in very many cases at least, to be of the slightest use, should be _immediate_, as a person in a fit (of apoplexy for instance) may die while a surgeon is being fetched from only the next street.
10136-8{_}30674{_}We shall give, as far as the fact of our editing a work for non-professional readers will permit, the peculiar and distinctive symptoms of all kind of fits, and the immediate treatment to be adopted in each case.
10136-8{_}30675{_}2634.
10136-8{_}30676{_}APOPLEXY.--These fits may be divided into two kinds--the _strong_ and the _weak_.
10136-8{_}30677{_}2635.
10136-8{_}30678{_}1.
10136-8{_}30679{_}_The strong kind_.--These cases mostly occur in stout, strong, short-necked, bloated-faced people, who are in the habit of living well.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30680{_}The patient may or may not have had headache, sparks before his eyes, with confusion of ideas and giddiness, for a day or two before the attack.
10136-8{_}30681{_}When it takes place, he falls down insensible; the body becomes paralyzed, generally more so on one side than the other; the face and head are hot, and the blood-vessels about them swollen; the pupils of the eyes are larger than natural, and the eyes themselves are fixed; the mouth is mostly drawn down at one corner; the breathing is like loud snoring; the pulse full and hard.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30682{_}Place the patient immediately in bed, with his head well raised; take off everything that he has round his neck, and bleed freely and at once from the arm.
10136-8{_}30683{_}If you have not got a lancet, use a penknife or anything suitable that may be at hand.
10136-8{_}30684{_}Apply warm mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs; put two drops of castor oil, mixed up with eight grains of calomel, on the top of the tongue, as far back as possible; a most important part of the treatment being to open the bowels as quickly and freely as possible.
10136-8{_}30685{_}The patient cannot swallow; but these medicines, especially the oil, will be absorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary action.
10136-8{_}30686{_}If possible, throw up a warm turpentine clyster (two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel), or, if this cannot be obtained, one composed of about a quart of warm salt-and-water and soap.
10136-8{_}30687{_}Cut off the hair, and apply rags dipped in weak vinegar-and-water, or weak gin-and-water, or even simple cold water, to the head.
10136-8{_}30688{_}If the blood-vessels about the head and neck are much swollen, put from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed side of the body.
10136-8{_}30689{_}Always send for a surgeon immediately, and act according to the above rules, doing more or less, according to the means at hand, and the length of time that must necessarily elapse until he arrives.
10136-8{_}30690{_}A pint, or even a quart of blood in a very strong person, may be taken away.
10136-8{_}30691{_}When the patient is able to swallow, give him the No.
10136-8{_}30692{_}1 pills, and the No.
10136-8{_}30693{_}1 mixture directly.
10136-8{_}30694{_}[The No.
10136-8{_}30695{_}1 pills are made as follows:--Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread-crumb: make into two pills, the dose for a full-grown person.
10136-8{_}30696{_}For the No.
10136-8{_}30697{_}1 mixture, dissolve on ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea: take a quarter of the mixture as a dose] Repeat these remedies if the bowels are not well opened.
10136-8{_}30698{_}Keep the patient's head well raised, and cool as above.
10136-8{_}30699{_}Give very low diet indeed: gruel, arrowroot, and the like.
10136-8{_}30700{_}When a person is recovering, he should have blisters applied to the nape of the neck, his bowels should be kept well open, light diet given, and fatigue, worry, and excess of all kinds avoided.
10136-8{_}30701{_}2636.
10136-8{_}30702{_}2.
10136-8{_}30703{_}_The weak kind_.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30704{_}These attacks are more frequently preceded by warning symptoms than the first kind.
10136-8{_}30705{_}The face is pale, the pulse weak, and the body, especially the hands and legs, cold.
10136-8{_}30706{_}After a little while, these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class in a mild degree.--_Treatment._ At first, if the pulse is _very feeble indeed_, a little brandy-and-water or sal-volatile must be given.
10136-8{_}30707{_}Mustard poultices are to be put, as before, to the soles of the foot and the insides of the thighs and legs.
10136-8{_}30708{_}Warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, are also to be placed under the armpits.
10136-8{_}30709{_}When the strength has returned, the body become warmer, and the pulse fuller and harder, the head should be shaved, and wet rags applied to it, as before described.
10136-8{_}30710{_}Leeches should be put, as before, to the temple opposite the side paralyzed; and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly as possible.
10136-8{_}30711{_}Bleeding from the arm is often necessary in these cases, but a non-professional person should never have recourse to it.
10136-8{_}30712{_}Blisters may be applied to the nape of the neck at once.
10136-8{_}30713{_}The diet in those cases should not be so low as in the former--indeed, it is often necessary, in a day or so after one of these attacks, to give wine, strong beef-tea, &c., according to the condition of the patient's strength.
10136-8{_}30714{_}2637.
10136-8{_}30715{_}_Distinctions between Apoplexy and Epilepsy_.--1.
10136-8{_}30716{_}Apoplexy mostly happens in people over _thirty_, whereas epilepsy generally occurs under that ago; at any rate for the first time.
10136-8{_}30717{_}A person who has epileptic fits over thirty, has generally suffered from them for some years.
10136-8{_}30718{_}2.
10136-8{_}30719{_}Again, _in apoplexy_, the body is paralyzed; and, therefore, has not _the convulsions which take place in epilepsy_.
10136-8{_}30720{_}3.
10136-8{_}30721{_}The peculiar _snoring_ will also distinguish apoplexy from epilepsy.
10136-8{_}30722{_}2638.
10136-8{_}30723{_}_Distinctions between Apoplexy and Drunkeness_.--1.
10136-8{_}30724{_}The known habits of the person.
10136-8{_}30725{_}2.
10136-8{_}30726{_}The fact of a person who was perfectly sober and sensible a little time before, being found in a state of insensibility.
10136-8{_}30727{_}3.
10136-8{_}30728{_}The absence, in apoplexy, of the _smell of drink_ on applying the nose to the mouth.
10136-8{_}30729{_}4.
10136-8{_}30730{_}A person in a fit of apoplexy cannot be roused at all; in drunkenness he mostly can, to a certain extent.
10136-8{_}30731{_}2639.
10136-8{_}30732{_}_Distinction between Apoplexy and Hysteria_.--Hysterics mostly happen in young, nervous, unmarried women; and are attended with convulsions, sobbing, laughter, throwing about of the body, &c. &c.  2640.
10136-8{_}30733{_}_Distinction between Apoplexy and Poisoning by Opium_.--It is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between these two cases.
10136-8{_}30734{_}In poisoning by opium, however, we find the particular smell of the drug in the patient's breath.
10136-8{_}30735{_}We should also, in forming our opinion, take into consideration the person's previous conduct--whether he has been low and desponding for some time before, or has ever talked about committing suicide.
10136-8{_}30736{_}2641.
10136-8{_}30737{_}EPILEPSY.--_Falling Sickness_.--Those fits mostly happen, at any rate for the first time, to young people, and are more common in boys than girls.
10136-8{_}30738{_}They are produced by numerous causes.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30739{_}The fit may be preceded by pains in the head, palpitations, &c. &c.; but it mostly happens that the person falls down insensible suddenly, and without any warning whatever.
10136-8{_}30740{_}The eyes are distorted, so that only their whites can be seen; there is mostly foaming from the mouth; the fingers are clinched; and the body, especially on one side, is much agitated; the tongue is often thrust out of the mouth.
10136-8{_}30741{_}When the fit goes off, the patient feels drowsy and faint, and often sleeps soundly for some time.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30742{_}During the fit, keep the patient flat on his back, with his head slightly raised, and prevent him from doing any harm to himself; dash cold water into his face, and apply smelling-salts to his nose; loosen his shirt collar, &c.; hold a piece of wood about as thick as a finger--the handle of a tooth-brush or knife will do as well--between the two rows of teeth, at the back part of the mouth.
10136-8{_}30743{_}This will prevent the tongue from being injured.
10136-8{_}30744{_}A teaspoonful of common salt thrust into the patient's mouth, during the fit, is of much service.
10136-8{_}30745{_}The after-treatment of these fits is various, and depends entirely upon their causes.
10136-8{_}30746{_}A good general rule, however, is always to keep the bowels well open, and the patient quiet, and free from fatigue, worry, and excess of all kinds.
10136-8{_}30747{_}2642.
10136-8{_}30748{_}_Fainting Fits_ are sometimes very dangerous, and at others perfectly harmless; the question of danger depending altogether upon the causes which have produced them, and which are exceedingly various.
10136-8{_}30749{_}For instance, fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious symptom indeed; whereas, that arising from some slight cause, such as the sight of blood, &c., need cause no alarm whatever.
10136-8{_}30750{_}The symptoms of simple fainting are so well known that it would be quite superfluous to enumerate them here.
10136-8{_}30751{_}The _treatment_ consists in laying the patient at full length upon his back, with his head upon a level with the rest of his body, loosening everything about the neck, dashing cold water into the face, and sprinkling vinegar and water about the mouth; applying smelling-salts to the nose; and, when the patient is able to swallow, in giving a little warm brandy-and-water, or about 20 drops of sal-volatile in water.
10136-8{_}30752{_}2643.
10136-8{_}30753{_}_Hysterics_.--These fits take place, for the most part, in young, nervous, unmarried women.
10136-8{_}30754{_}They happen much less often in married women; and even (in some rare cases indeed) in men.
10136-8{_}30755{_}Young women, who are subject to these fits, are apt to think that they are suffering from "all the ills that flesh is heir to;" and the false symptoms of disease which they show are so like the true ones, that it is often exceedingly difficult to detect the difference.
10136-8{_}30756{_}The fits themselves are mostly preceded by great depression of spirits, shedding of tears, sickness, palpitation of the heart, &c. A pain, as if a nail were being driven in, is also often felt at one particular part of the head.
10136-8{_}30757{_}In almost all cases, when a fit is coming on, pain is felt on the left side.
10136-8{_}30758{_}This pain rises gradually until it reaches the throat, and then gives the patient a sensation as if she had a pellet there, which prevents her from breathing properly, and, in fact, seems to threaten actual suffocation.
10136-8{_}30759{_}The patient now generally becomes insensible, and faints; the body is thrown about in all directions, froth issues from the mouth, incoherent expressions are uttered, and fits of laughter, crying, or screaming, take place.
10136-8{_}30760{_}When the fit is going off, the patient mostly cries bitterly, sometimes knowing all, and at others nothing, of what has taken place, and feeling general soreness all over the body.
10136-8{_}30761{_}_Treatment during the fit_.
10136-8{_}30762{_}Place the body in the same position as for simple fainting, and treat, in other respects, as directed in the article on Epilepsy.
10136-8{_}30763{_}_Always well loosen the patient's stays_; and, when she is recovering, and able to swallow, give 20 drops of sal volatile in a little water.
10136-8{_}30764{_}The _after-treatment_ of these cases is very various.
10136-8{_}30765{_}If the patient is of a strong constitution, she should live on plain diet, take plenty of exercise, and take occasional doses of castor oil, or an aperient mixture, such as that described as "No.
10136-8{_}30766{_}1," in previous numbers.
10136-8{_}30767{_}If, as is mostly the case, the patient is weak and delicate, she will require a different mode of treatment altogether.
10136-8{_}30768{_}Good nourishing diet, gentle exercise, cold baths, occasionally a dose of No.
10136-8{_}30769{_}3 myrrh and aloes pills at night, and a dose of compound iron pills twice a day.
10136-8{_}30770{_}[As to the myrrh and aloes pills (No.
10136-8{_}30771{_}3), 10 grains made into two pills are a dose for a full-grown person.
10136-8{_}30772{_}Of the compound iron pills (No.
10136-8{_}30773{_}4), the dose for a full grown person is also 10 grains, made into two pills.]
10136-8{_}30774{_}In every case, amusing the mind, and avoiding all causes of over-excitement, are of great service in bringing about a permanent cure.
10136-8{_}30775{_}2644.
10136-8{_}30776{_}LIVER COMPLAINT AND SPASMS.--A very obliging correspondent recommends the following, from personal experience:--Take 4 oz.
10136-8{_}30777{_}of dried dandelion root, 1 oz.
10136-8{_}30778{_}of the best ginger, 1/4 oz.
10136-8{_}30779{_}of Columba root; braise and boil all together in 3 pints of water till it is reduced to a quart: strain, and take a wine-glassful every four hours.
10136-8{_}30780{_}Our correspondent says it is a "safe and simple medicine for both liver complaint and spasms."
10136-8{_}30781{_}2645.
10136-8{_}30782{_}LUMBAGO.--A "new and successful mode" of treating lumbago, advocated by Dr. Day, is a form of counter-irritation, said to have been introduced into this country by the late Sir Anthony Carlisle, and which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button, gently heated in a spirit-lamp, to the skin.
10136-8{_}30783{_}Dr. Corrigan published, about three years ago, an account of some cases very successfully treated by nearly similar means.
10136-8{_}30784{_}Dr. Corrigan's plan was, however, to touch the surface of the part affected, at intervals of half an inch, as lightly and rapidly as possible.
10136-8{_}30785{_}Dr. Day has found greater advantages to result from drawing the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the affected part, so as to act on a greater extent of surface.
10136-8{_}30786{_}The doctor speaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from this practice, that it is evidently highly deserving attention.
10136-8{_}30787{_}2646.
10136-8{_}30788{_}PALPITATION OF THE HEART.--Where palpitation occurs as symptomatic of indigestion, the treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder; when it is consequent on a plethoric state, purgatives will be effectual.
10136-8{_}30789{_}In this case the patient should abstain from every kind of diet likely to produce a plethoric condition of body.
10136-8{_}30790{_}Animal food and fermented liquor must be particularly avoided.
10136-8{_}30791{_}Too much indulgence in sleep will also prove injurious.
10136-8{_}30792{_}When the attacks arise from nervous irritability, the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a tonic diet.
10136-8{_}30793{_}Should the palpitation originate from organic derangement, it must be, of course, beyond domestic management.
10136-8{_}30794{_}Luxurious living, indolence, and tight-lacing often produce this affection: such cases are to be conquered with a little resolution.
10136-8{_}30795{_}2647.

10136-8{_}30814{_}2648.
10136-8{_}30815{_}The symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from those of some diseases, which they are very like, from the fact of their coming on _immediately_ after eating or drinking something; whereas those of disease come on, in most cases at least, by degrees, and with warnings.
10136-8{_}30816{_}In most cases where poison is known, or suspected, to have been taken, the first thing to be done is to empty the stomach, well and immediately, by means of mustard mixed in warm water, or plain warm salt-and-water, or, better, this draught, which we call No.
10136-8{_}30817{_}1:--Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water.
10136-8{_}30818{_}This draught to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not ensue.
10136-8{_}30819{_}The back part of the throat should be well tickled with a feather, or two of the fingers thrust down it, to induce vomiting.
10136-8{_}30820{_}The cases where vomiting must not be used are those where the skin has been taken off, and the parts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken, and where the action of vomiting would increase the evil.
10136-8{_}30821{_}Full instructions are given in the article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are not to be given.
10136-8{_}30822{_}The best and safest way of emptying the stomach is by means of the stomach-pump, as in certain cases the action of vomiting is likely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested condition of the blood-vessels of the head, which often takes place.
10136-8{_}30823{_}In the hands, however, of any one else than a surgeon, it would be not only useless, but harmful, as a great deal of dexterity, caution, and experience are required to use it properly.
10136-8{_}30824{_}After having made these brief introductory remarks, we shall now proceed to particulars.
10136-8{_}30825{_}2649.
10136-8{_}30826{_}_Sulphuric Acid, or Oil of Vitriol_ (a clear, colourless liquid, of an oily appearance).--_Symptoms in those who have swallowed it_.
10136-8{_}30827{_}When much is taken, these come on immediately.
10136-8{_}30828{_}There is great burning pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach; vomiting of a liquid of a dark coffee-colour, often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood; the skin inside the mouth is taken off; and the exposed surface is at first white, and after a time becomes brownish.
10136-8{_}30829{_}There are sometimes spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck, caused by drops of the acid falling on these parts.
10136-8{_}30830{_}There is great difficulty of breathing, owing to the swelling at the back part of the mouth.
10136-8{_}30831{_}After a time there is much depression of strength, with a quick, weak pulse, and cold, clammy skin.
10136-8{_}30832{_}The face is pale, and has a very anxious look.
10136-8{_}30833{_}When the acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water, the same kind of symptoms occur, only in a milder degree.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30834{_}Give a mixture of magnesia in milk-and-water, or, if this cannot be obtained, of finely powdered chalk, or whiting, or even of the plaster torn down from the walls or ceiling, in milk-and-water.
10136-8{_}30835{_}The mixture should be nearly as thick as cream, and plenty of it given.
10136-8{_}30836{_}As well as this, simple gruel, milk, or thick flour-and-water, are very useful, and should be given in large quantities.
10136-8{_}30837{_}Violent inflammation of the parts touched by the acid is most likely to take place in the coarse of a little time, and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon; but if one cannot be obtained, leeches, the fever-mixtures (the recipe for which appears repeatedly in previous paragraphs), thick drinks, such as barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, &c., must be had recourse to, according to the symptoms of each particular case and the means at hand.
10136-8{_}30838{_}The inflamed condition of the back part of the mouth requires particular attention.
10136-8{_}30839{_}When the breathing is very laboured and difficult in consequence, from fifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the outside of the throat, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations constantly kept to the part.
10136-8{_}30840{_}When the pain over the stomach is very great, the same local treatment is necessary; but if it is only slight, a good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches.
10136-8{_}30841{_}In all these cases, two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture should be given every four hours, and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for some days.
10136-8{_}30842{_}2650.
10136-8{_}30843{_}_Nitric Acid_, commonly known as _Aqua Fortis_, or _Red Spirit of Nitre_ (a straw-coloured fluid, of the consistence of water, and which gives off dense white fumes on exposure to the air).--_Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it._ Much the same as in the case of sulphuric acid.
10136-8{_}30844{_}In this case, however, the surface touched by the acid becomes _yellowish_.
10136-8{_}30845{_}The tongue is mostly much swollen.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30846{_}The same as for sulphuric acid.
10136-8{_}30847{_}2651.
10136-8{_}30848{_}_Muriatic Acid, Spirit of Salt_ (a thin yellow fluid, emitting dense white fumes on exposure to the air).--This is not often taken as a poison.
10136-8{_}30849{_}The _symptoms_ and _treatment_ are much the same as those of _nitric acid_.
10136-8{_}30850{_}N.B.--_In no case of poisoning by these three acids should emetics ever be given_.
10136-8{_}30851{_}2652.
10136-8{_}30852{_}_Oxalic Acid_, commonly called _Salt of Lemons_.--This poison may be taken by mistake for Epsom salts, which it is a good deal like.
10136-8{_}30853{_}It may be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape, which is that of needle-formed crystals, each of which, if put into a drop of ink, will turn it to a reddish brown, whereas Epsom salts will not change its colour at all.
10136-8{_}30854{_}When a large dose of this poison has been taken, death takes place very quickly indeed.--_Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it_.
10136-8{_}30855{_}A hot, burning, acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing, and vomiting of a _greenish-brown_ fluid is produced, sooner or later, according to the quantity and strength of the poison taken.
10136-8{_}30856{_}There is great tenderness felt over the stomach, followed by clammy perspirations and convulsions; the legs are often drawn up, and there is generally stupor, from which the patient, however, can easily be roused, and always great prostration of strength.
10136-8{_}30857{_}The pulse is small and weak, and the breathing faint.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30858{_}Chalk or magnesia, made into a cream with water, should be given in large quantities, and afterwards the emetic draught above prescribed, or some mustard-and-water, if the draught cannot be got.
10136-8{_}30859{_}The back part of the throat to be tickled with a feather, to induce vomiting.
10136-8{_}30860{_}Arrowroot, gruel, and the like drinks, are to be taken.
10136-8{_}30861{_}When the prostration of strength is very great and the body cold, warmth is to be applied to it, and a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water, given.
10136-8{_}30862{_}2653.
10136-8{_}30863{_}_Prussic Acid_ (a thin, transparent, and colourless liquid, with a peculiar smell, which greatly resembles that of bitter almonds).--_Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it_.
10136-8{_}30864{_}These come on _immediately_ after the poison has been taken, and may be produced by merely _smelling_ it.
10136-8{_}30865{_}The patient becomes perfectly insensible, and falls down in convulsions--his eyes are fixed and staring, the pupils being bigger than natural, the skin is cold and clammy, the pulse scarcely perceptible, and the breathing slow and gasping.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30866{_}Very little can be done in these cases, as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed, when it takes place at all.
10136-8{_}30867{_}The best treatment--which should always be adopted in all cases, even though the patient appears quite dead-is to dash quantities of cold water on the back, from the top of the neck downwards.
10136-8{_}30868{_}Placing the patient under a pump, and pumping on him, is the best way of doing this.
10136-8{_}30869{_}Smelling-salts are also to be applied to the nose, and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment.
10136-8{_}30870{_}2654.
10136-8{_}30871{_}ALKALIS: _Potash, Soda_, and _Ammonia_, or common _Smelling-Salts_, with their principal preparations--_Pearlash, Soap Lees, Liquor Potassae, Nitre, Sal Prunella, Hartshorn_, and _Sal--Volatile._--Alkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life.
10136-8{_}30872{_}They may, however, be swallowed by mistake.--_Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed them_.
10136-8{_}30873{_}There is at first a burning, acrid taste in, and a sensation of tightness round, the throat, like that of strangling; the skin touched is destroyed; retching mostly followed by actual vomiting, then sets in; the vomited matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour, with little shreds of flesh here and there, and always changing vegetable blue colours green.
10136-8{_}30874{_}There is now great tenderness over the whole of the belly.
10136-8{_}30875{_}After a little while, great weakness, with cold, clammy sweats, a quick weak pulse, and purging of bloody matters, takes place.
10136-8{_}30876{_}The brain, too, mostly becomes affected.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30877{_}Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning sensation is relieved.
10136-8{_}30878{_}Any kind of oil or milk may also be given, and will form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach.
10136-8{_}30879{_}Barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, linseed-tea, &c., are also very useful, and should be taken constantly, and in large quantities.
10136-8{_}30880{_}If inflammation should take place, it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomentations to the part where the pain is most felt, and giving two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours.
10136-8{_}30881{_}The diet in all these cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first few days, and then of weak broth or beef-tea for some time after.
10136-8{_}30882{_}2655.
10136-8{_}30883{_}When very strong fumes of smelling-salts have in any way been inhaled, there is great difficulty of breathing, and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils.
10136-8{_}30884{_}In this case let the patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar, and treat the feverish symptoms as before.
10136-8{_}30885{_}2656.
10136-8{_}30886{_}_Arsenic_.--Mostly seen under the form of white arsenic, or fly-powder, and yellow arsenic, or king's yellow.--_Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it_.
10136-8{_}30887{_}These vary very much, according to the form and dose in which the poison has been taken.
10136-8{_}30888{_}There is faintness, depression, and sickness, with an intense burning pain in the region of the stomach, which gets worse and worse, and is increased by pressure.
10136-8{_}30889{_}There is also vomiting of dark brown matter, sometimes mixed with blood; and mostly great thirst, with a feeling of tightness round, and of burning in, the throat.
10136-8{_}30890{_}Purging also takes place, the matters brought away being mixed with blood.
10136-8{_}30891{_}The pulse is small and irregular, and the skin sometimes cold and clammy, and at others hot.
10136-8{_}30892{_}The breathing is painful.
10136-8{_}30893{_}Convulsions and spasms often occur.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30894{_}Give a couple of teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water, to bring on or assist vomiting, and also use the other means elsewhere recommended for the purpose.
10136-8{_}30895{_}A solution, half of lime-water and half of linseed-oil, well mixed, may be given, as well as plenty of arrowroot, gruel, or linseed-tea.
10136-8{_}30896{_}Simple milk is also useful.
10136-8{_}30897{_}A little castor-oil should be given, to cleanse the intestines of all the poison, and the after-symptoms treated on general principles.
10136-8{_}30898{_}2657.
10136-8{_}30899{_}_Corrosive Sublimate_.--Mostly seen in the form of little heavy crystalline masses, which melt in water, and have a metallic taste.
10136-8{_}30900{_}It is sometimes seen in powder.
10136-8{_}30901{_}This is a most powerful poison.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30902{_}These mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken.
10136-8{_}30903{_}There is a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing, with a burning heat, extending from the top of the throat down to the stomach; and also a feeling of great tightness round the throat.
10136-8{_}30904{_}In a few minutes great pain is felt over the region of the stomach, and frequent vomiting of long, stringy white masses, mixed with blood, takes place.
10136-8{_}30905{_}There is also mostly great purging.
10136-8{_}30906{_}The countenance is generally pale and anxious; the pulse always small and frequent; the skin cold and clammy, and the breathing difficult.
10136-8{_}30907{_}Convulsions and insensibility often occur, and are very bad symptoms indeed.
10136-8{_}30908{_}The inside of the mouth is more or less swollen.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30909{_}Mix the whites of a dozen eggs in two pints of cold water, and give a glassful of the mixture every three or four minutes, until the stomach can contain no more.
10136-8{_}30910{_}If vomiting does not now come on naturally, and supposing the mouth is not very sore or much swollen, an emetic draught, No.
10136-8{_}30911{_}1, may be given, and vomiting induced.
10136-8{_}30912{_}(The No.
10136-8{_}30913{_}1 draught, we remind our readers, is thus made:--Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water; the draught to be repeated if vomiting does not take place in a quarter of an hour.)
10136-8{_}30914{_}After the stomach has been well cleaned out, milk, flour-and-water, linseed-tea, or barley-water, should be taken in large quantities.
10136-8{_}30915{_}If eggs cannot be obtained, milk, or flour-and-water, should be given as a substitute for them at once.
10136-8{_}30916{_}When the depression of strength is very great indeed, a little warm brandy-and-water must be given.
10136-8{_}30917{_}In the course of an hour or two the patient should take two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil, and if inflammation comes on, it is to be treated as directed in the article on acids and alkalis.
10136-8{_}30918{_}The diet should also be the same.
10136-8{_}30919{_}If the patient recovers, great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place.
10136-8{_}30920{_}The simplest, and at the same time one of the best modes of treatment, is to wash them well three or four times a day with brandy-and-water.
10136-8{_}30921{_}2658.
10136-8{_}30922{_}_Calomel_.--A heavy white powder, without taste, and insoluble in water.
10136-8{_}30923{_}It has been occasionally known to destroy life.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30924{_}Much the same as in the case of corrosive sublimate.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30925{_}The same as for corrosive sublimate.
10136-8{_}30926{_}If the gums are sore, wash them, as recommended in the case of corrosive sublimate, with brandy-and-water three or four times a day, and keep the patient on _fluids_, such as arrowroot, gruel, broth, or beef-tea, according to the other symptoms.
10136-8{_}30927{_}Eating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender.
10136-8{_}30928{_}2659.
10136-8{_}30929{_}_Copper_.--The preparations of this metal which are most likely to be the ones producing poisonous symptoms, are _blue-stone_ and _verdigris_.
10136-8{_}30930{_}People are often taken ill after eating food that has been cooked in copper saucepans.
10136-8{_}30931{_}When anything has been cooked in one of these vessels, _it should never be allowed to cool in it_.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30932{_}Headache, pain in the stomach, and purging; vomiting of green or blue matters, convulsions, and spasms.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30933{_}Give whites of eggs, sugar-and-water, castor-oil, and drinks, such as arrowroot and gruel.
10136-8{_}30934{_}2660.
10136-8{_}30935{_}_Emetic Tartar_.--Seen in the form of a white powder, or crystals, with a slightly metallic taste.
10136-8{_}30936{_}It has not often been known to destroy life.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30937{_}A strong metallic taste in the act of swallowing, followed by a burning pain in the region of the stomach, vomiting, and great purging.
10136-8{_}30938{_}The pulse is small and rapid, the skin cold and clammy, the breathing difficult and painful, and the limbs often much cramped.
10136-8{_}30939{_}There is also great prostration of strength.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30940{_}Promote the vomiting by giving plenty of warm water, or warm arrowroot and water.
10136-8{_}30941{_}Strong tea, in large quantities, should be drunk; or, if it can be obtained, a decoction of oak bark.
10136-8{_}30942{_}The after-treatment is the same as that for acids and alkalis; the principal object in all these cases being to keep down the inflammation of the parts touched by the poison by means of leeches, warm poppy fomentations, fever-mixtures, and very low diet.
10136-8{_}30943{_}2661.
10136-8{_}30944{_}_Lead_, and its preparations, _Sugar of Lead, Goulard's Extract, White Lead._--Lead is by no means an active poison, although it is popularly considered to be so.
10136-8{_}30945{_}It mostly affects people by being taken into the system slowly, as in the case of painters and glaziers.
10136-8{_}30946{_}A newly-painted house, too, often affects those living in it.--_Symptoms produced when taken in a large dose_.
10136-8{_}30947{_}There is at first a burning, pricking sensation in the throat, to which thirst, giddiness, and vomiting follow.
10136-8{_}30948{_}The belly is tight, swollen, and painful; _the pain being relieved by pressure_.
10136-8{_}30949{_}The bowels are mostly bound.
10136-8{_}30950{_}There is great depression of strength, and a cold skin.--Treatment.
10136-8{_}30951{_}Give an emetic draught (No.
10136-8{_}30952{_}1, see above) at once, and shortly afterwards a solution of Epsom salts in large quantities.
10136-8{_}30953{_}A little brandy-and-water must be taken if the depression of strength is very great indeed.
10136-8{_}30954{_}Milk, whites of eggs, and arrowroot are also useful.
10136-8{_}30955{_}After two or three hours, cleanse the stomach and intestines well out with two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil, and treat the symptoms which follow according to the rules laid down in other parts of these articles.--_Symptoms when it is taken into the body slowly_.
10136-8{_}30956{_}Headache, pain about the navel, loss of appetite and flesh, offensive breath, a blueness of the edges of the gums; the belly is tight, hard, and knotty, and the pulse slow and languid.
10136-8{_}30957{_}There is also sometimes a difficulty in swallowing.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30958{_}Give five grains of calomel and half a grain of opium directly, in the form of a pill, and half an ounce of Epsom salts in two hours, and repeat this treatment until the bowels are well opened.
10136-8{_}30959{_}Put the patient into a warm bath, and throw up a clyster of warmish water when he is in it.
10136-8{_}30960{_}Fomentations of warm oil of turpentine, if they can be obtained, should be put over the whole of the belly.
10136-8{_}30961{_}The great object is to open the bowels as freely and as quickly as possible.
10136-8{_}30962{_}When this has been done, a grain of pure opium may be given.
10136-8{_}30963{_}Arrowroot or gruel should be taken in good large quantities.
10136-8{_}30964{_}The after-treatment must depend altogether upon the symptoms of each particular case.
10136-8{_}30965{_}2662.
10136-8{_}30966{_}_Opium_, and its preparations, _Laudanum, &c_.--Solid opium is mostly seen in the form of rich brown flattish cakes, with little pieces of leaves sticking on them here and there, and a bitter and slightly warm taste.
10136-8{_}30967{_}The most common form in which it is taken as a poison, is that of laudanum.--_Symptoms_.
10136-8{_}30968{_}These consist at first in giddiness and stupor, followed by insensibility, the patient, however, being roused to consciousness by a great noise, so as to be able to answer a question, but becoming insensible again almost immediately.
10136-8{_}30969{_}The pulse is now quick and small, the breathing hurried, and the skin warm and covered with perspiration.
10136-8{_}30970{_}After a little time, these symptoms change; the person becomes _perfectly insensible_, the breathing slow and _snoring_, as in apoplexy, the skin cold, and the pulse slow and full.
10136-8{_}30971{_}The pupil of the eye is mostly smaller than natural.
10136-8{_}30972{_}On applying his nose to the patient's mouth, a person may smell the poison very distinctly.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30973{_}Give an emetic draught (No.
10136-8{_}30974{_}1, see above) directly, with large quantities of warm mustard-and-water, warm salt-and-water, or simple warm water.
10136-8{_}30975{_}Tickle the top of the throat with a feather, or put two fingers down it to bring on vomiting, which rarely takes place of itself.
10136-8{_}30976{_}Dash cold water on the head, chest, and spine, and flap these parts well with the ends of wet towels.
10136-8{_}30977{_}Give strong coffee or tea.
10136-8{_}30978{_}Walk the patient up and down in the open air for two or three hours; the great thing being to keep him from sleeping.
10136-8{_}30979{_}Electricity is of much service.
10136-8{_}30980{_}When the patient is recovering, mustard poultices should be applied to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs.
10136-8{_}30981{_}The head should be kept cool and raised.
10136-8{_}30982{_}2663.
10136-8{_}30983{_}The following preparations, which are constantly given to children by their nurses and mothers, for the purpose of making them sleep, often prove fatal:--_Syrup of Poppies_, and _Godfrey's Cordial_.
10136-8{_}30984{_}The author would most earnestly urge all people caring for their children's lives, never to allow any of these preparations to be given, unless ordered by a surgeon.
10136-8{_}30985{_}2664.
10136-8{_}30986{_}The treatment in the case of poisoning by _Henbane_, _Hemlock_, _Nightshade_, and _Foxglove_, is much the same as that for opium.
10136-8{_}30987{_}Vomiting should be brought on in all of them.
10136-8{_}30988{_}2665.
10136-8{_}30989{_}_Poisonous Food_.--It sometimes happens that things which are in daily use, and mostly perfectly harmless, give rise, under certain unknown circumstances, and in certain individuals, to the symptoms of poisoning.
10136-8{_}30990{_}The most common articles of food of this description are _Mussels_, _Salmon_, and certain kinds of _Cheese_ and _Bacon_.
10136-8{_}30991{_}The general symptoms are thirst, weight about the stomach, difficulty of breathing, vomiting, purging, spasms, prostration of strength, and, in the case of mussels more particularly, an eruption on the body, like that of nettle-rash.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}30992{_}Empty the stomach well with No.
10136-8{_}30993{_}1 draught and warm water, and give two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil immediately after.
10136-8{_}30994{_}Let the patient take plenty of arrowroot, gruel, and the like drinks, and if there is much depression of strength, give a little warm brandy-and-water.
10136-8{_}30995{_}Should symptoms of fever or inflammation follow, they must be treated as directed in the articles on other kinds of poisoning.
10136-8{_}30996{_}2666.
10136-8{_}30997{_}_Mushrooms_, and similar kinds of vegetables, often produce poisonous effects.
10136-8{_}30998{_}The symptoms are various, sometimes giddiness and stupor, and at others pain in and swelling of the belly, with vomiting and purging, being the leading ones.
10136-8{_}30999{_}When the symptoms come on quickly after taking the poison, it is generally the head that is affected.--The treatment consists in bringing on vomiting in the usual manner, as quickly and as freely as possible.
10136-8{_}31000{_}The other symptoms are to be treated on general principles; if they are those of depression, by brandy-and-water or sal-volatile; if those of inflammation, by leeches, fomentations, fever-mixtures, &c. &c.  2667.
10136-8{_}31001{_}FOR CURE OF RINGWORM.--Take of subcarbonate of soda 1 drachm, which dissolve in 1/2 pint of vinegar.
10136-8{_}31002{_}Wash the head every morning with soft soap, and apply the lotion night and morning.
10136-8{_}31003{_}One teaspoonful of sulphur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morning.
10136-8{_}31004{_}The hair should be cut close, and round the spot it should be shaved off, and the part, night and morning, bathed with a lotion made by dissolving a drachm of white vitriol in 8 oz.
10136-8{_}31005{_}of water.
10136-8{_}31006{_}A small piece of either of the two subjoined ointments rubbed into the part when the lotion has dried in.
10136-8{_}31007{_}No, 1.--Take of citron ointment 1 drachm; sulphur and tar ointment, of each 1/2 oz.
10136-8{_}31008{_}: mix thoroughly, and apply twice a day.
10136-8{_}31009{_}No.
10136-8{_}31010{_}2.--Take of simple cerate 1 oz.
10136-8{_}31011{_}; creosote 1 drachm; calomel 30 grains: mix and use in the same manner as the first.
10136-8{_}31012{_}Concurrent with these external remedies, the child should take an alterative powder every morning, or, if they act too much on the bowels, only every second day.
10136-8{_}31013{_}The following will be found to answer all the intentions desired.
10136-8{_}31014{_}2668.
10136-8{_}31015{_}Alterative Powders for Ringworm.--Take of    Sulphuret of antimony, precipitated .
10136-8{_}31016{_}24 grains.
10136-8{_}31017{_}Grey powder    .
10136-8{_}31018{_}.
10136-8{_}31019{_}.
10136-8{_}31020{_}.
10136-8{_}31021{_}.
10136-8{_}31022{_}12 grains.
10136-8{_}31023{_}Calomel .
10136-8{_}31024{_}.
10136-8{_}31025{_}.
10136-8{_}31026{_}.
10136-8{_}31027{_}.
10136-8{_}31028{_}.
10136-8{_}31029{_}6 grains.
10136-8{_}31030{_}Jalap powder   .
10136-8{_}31031{_}.
10136-8{_}31032{_}.
10136-8{_}31033{_}.
10136-8{_}31034{_}.
10136-8{_}31035{_}36 grains.
10136-8{_}31036{_}Mix carefully, and divide into 12 powders for a child from 1 to 2 years old; into 9 powders for a child from 2 to 4 years; and into 6 powders for a child from 4 to 6 years.
10136-8{_}31037{_}Where the patient is older, the strength may be increased by enlarging the quantities of the drugs ordered, or by giving one and a half or two powders for one dose.
10136-8{_}31038{_}The ointment is to be well washed off every morning with soap-and-water, and the part bathed with the lotion before re-applying the ointment.
10136-8{_}31039{_}An imperative fact must be remembered by mother or nurse,--never to use the same comb employed for the child with ringworm, for the healthy children, or let the affected little one sleep with those free from the disease; and, for fear of any contact by hands or otherwise, to keep the child's head enveloped in a nightcap, till this eruption is completely cured.
10136-8{_}31040{_}2669.
10136-8{_}31041{_}SCRATCHES.--Trifling as scratches often seem, they ought never to be neglected, but should be covered and protected, and kept clean and dry until they have completely healed.
10136-8{_}31042{_}If there is the least appearance of inflammation, no time should be lost in applying a large bread-and-water poultice, or hot flannels repeatedly applied, or even leeches in good numbers may be put on at some distance from each other.
10136-8{_}31043{_}2670.
10136-8{_}31044{_}FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH, OR DIFFICULT BREATHING.--Vitriolated spirits of ether 1 oz., camphor 12 grains: make a solution, of which take a teaspoonful during the paroxysm.
10136-8{_}31045{_}This is found to afford instantaneous relief in difficulty of breathing, depending on internal diseases and other causes, where the patient, from a very quick and laborious breathing, is obliged to be in an erect posture.
10136-8{_}31046{_}2671.
10136-8{_}31047{_}SPRAINS.--A sprain is a stretching of the leaders or ligaments of a part through some violence, such as slipping, falling on the hands, pulling a limb, &c. &c. The most common are those of the ankle and wrist.
10136-8{_}31048{_}These accidents are more serious than people generally suppose, and often more difficult to cure than a broken log or arm.
10136-8{_}31049{_}The first thing to be done is to place the sprained part in the straight position, and to raise it a little as well.
10136-8{_}31050{_}Some recommend the application of cold lotions at first.
10136-8{_}31051{_}The editress, however, is quite convinced that warm applications are, in most cases, the best for for the first three or four days.
10136-8{_}31052{_}These fomentations are to be applied in the following manner:--Dip a good-sized piece of flannel into a pail or basin full of hot water or hot poppy fomentation,--six poppy heads boiled in one quart of water for about a quarter of an hour; wring it almost dry, and apply it, as hot as the patient can bear, right round the sprained part.
10136-8{_}31053{_}Then place another piece of flannel, quite dry, over it, in order that the steam and warmth may not escape.
10136-8{_}31054{_}This process should be repeated as often as the patient feels that the flannel next to his skin is getting cold--the oftener the better.
10136-8{_}31055{_}The bowels should be opened with a black draught, and the patient kept on low diet.
10136-8{_}31056{_}If he has been a great drinker, he may be allowed to take a little beer; but it is better not to do so.
10136-8{_}31057{_}A little of the cream of tartar drink, ordered in the case of burns, may be taken occasionally if there is much thirst.
10136-8{_}31058{_}When the swelling and tenderness about the joint are very great, from eight to twelve leeches may be applied.
10136-8{_}31059{_}When the knee is the joint affected, the greatest pain is felt at the inside, and therefore the greater quantity of the leeches should be applied to that part.
10136-8{_}31060{_}When the shoulder is sprained, the arm should be kept close to the body by means of a linen roller, which is to be taken four or five times round the whole of the chest.
10136-8{_}31061{_}It should also be brought two or three times underneath the elbow, in order to raise the shoulder.
10136-8{_}31062{_}This is the best treatment for these accidents during the first three or four days.
10136-8{_}31063{_}After that time, supposing that no unfavourable symptoms have taken place, a cold lotion, composed of a tablespoonful of sal-ammoniac to a quart of water, or vinegar-and-water, should be constantly applied.
10136-8{_}31064{_}This lotion will strengthen the part, and also help in taking away any thickening that may have formed about the joint.
10136-8{_}31065{_}In the course of two or three weeks, according to circumstances, the joint is to be rubbed twice a day with flannel dipped in opodeldoc, a flannel bandage rolled tightly round the joint, the pressure being greatest at the lowest part, and the patient allowed to walk about with the assistance of a crutch or stick.
10136-8{_}31066{_}He should also occasionally, when sitting or lying down, quietly bend the joint backwards and forwards, to cause its natural motion to return, and to prevent stiffness from taking place.
10136-8{_}31067{_}When the swelling is very great immediately after the accident has occurred, from the breaking of the blood-vessels, it is best to apply cold applications at first.
10136-8{_}31068{_}If it can be procured, oil-silk may be put over the warm-fomentation flannel, instead of the dry piece of flannel.
10136-8{_}31069{_}Old flannel is better than new.
10136-8{_}31070{_}2672.
10136-8{_}31071{_}CURE FOR STAMMERING.--Where there is no malformation of the organs of articulation, stammering may be remedied by reading aloud with the teeth closed.
10136-8{_}31072{_}This should be practised for two hours a day, for three or four months.
10136-8{_}31073{_}The advocate of this simple remedy says, "I can speak with certainty of its utility."
10136-8{_}31074{_}2673.
10136-8{_}31075{_}STAMMERING.--At a recent meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History, Dr. Warren stated, "A simple, easy, and effectual cure of stammering."
10136-8{_}31076{_}It is, simply, at every syllable pronounced, to tap at the same time with the finger; by so doing, "the most inveterate stammerer will be surprised to find that he can pronounce quite fluently, and, by long and constant practice, he will pronounce perfectly well."
10136-8{_}31077{_}2674.
10136-8{_}31078{_}SUFFOCATION, APPARENT.--Suffocation may arise from many different causes.
10136-8{_}31079{_}Anything which prevents the air getting into the lungs will produce it.
10136-8{_}31080{_}We shall give the principal causes, and the treatment to be followed in each case.
10136-8{_}31081{_}2675.
10136-8{_}31082{_}1.
10136-8{_}31083{_}_Carbonic Acid Gas.
10136-8{_}31084{_}Choke-Damp of Mines_.--This poisonous gas is met with in rooms where charcoal is burnt, and where there is not sufficient draught to allow it to escape; in coalpits, near limekilns, in breweries, and in rooms and houses where a great many people live huddled together in wretchedness and filth, and where the air in consequence becomes poisoned.
10136-8{_}31085{_}This gas gives out no smell, so that we cannot know of its presence.
10136-8{_}31086{_}A candle will not burn in a room which contains much of it.--_Effects_.
10136-8{_}31087{_}At first there is giddiness, and a great wish to sleep; after a little time, or where there is much of it present, a person feels great weight in the head, and stupid; gets by degrees quite unable to move, and snores as if in a deep sleep.
10136-8{_}31088{_}The limbs may or may not be stiff.
10136-8{_}31089{_}The heat of the body remains much the same at first.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31090{_}Remove the person affected into the open air, and, even though it is cold weather, take off his clothes.
10136-8{_}31091{_}Then lay him on his back, with his head slightly raised.
10136-8{_}31092{_}Having done this, dash vinegar-and-water over the whole of the body, and rub it hard, especially the face and chest, with towels dipped in the same mixture.
10136-8{_}31093{_}The hands and feet also should be rubbed with a hard brush.
10136-8{_}31094{_}Apply smelling-salts to the nose, which may be tickled with a feather.
10136-8{_}31095{_}Dashing cold water down the middle of the back is of great service.
10136-8{_}31096{_}If the person can swallow, give him a little lemon-water, or vinegar-and-water to drink.
10136-8{_}31097{_}The principal means, however, to be employed in this, as, in fact, in most cases of apparent suffocation, is what is called _artificial breathing_.
10136-8{_}31098{_}This operation should be performed by three persons, and in the following manner:--The first person should put the nozzle of a common pair of bellows into one of the patient's nostrils; the second should push down, and then thrust back, that part of the throat called "Adam's apple;" and the third should first raise and then depress the chest, one hand being placed over each side of the ribs.
10136-8{_}31099{_}These three actions should be performed in the following order:--First of all, the throat should be drawn down and thrust back; then the chest should be raised, and the bellows gently blown into the nostril.
10136-8{_}31100{_}Directly this is done, the chest should be depressed, so as to imitate common breathing.
10136-8{_}31101{_}This process should be repeated about eighteen times a minute.
10136-8{_}31102{_}The mouth and the other nostril should be closed while the bellows are being blown.
10136-8{_}31103{_}Persevere, if necessary, with this treatment for seven or eight hours--in fact, till absolute signs of death are visible.
10136-8{_}31104{_}Many lives are lost by giving it up too quickly.
10136-8{_}31105{_}When the patient becomes roused, he is to be put into a warm bed, and a little brandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, given cautiously now and then.
10136-8{_}31106{_}This treatment is to be adopted in all cases where people are affected from breathing bad air, smells, &c. &c.  2676.
10136-8{_}31107{_}2.
10136-8{_}31108{_}_Drowning_.--This is one of the most frequent causes of death by suffocation.--Treatment.
10136-8{_}31109{_}Many methods have been adopted, and as some of them are not only useless, but hurtful, we will mention them here, merely in order that they may be avoided.
10136-8{_}31110{_}In the first place, then, never hang a person up by his heels, as it is an error to suppose that water gets into the lungs.
10136-8{_}31111{_}Hanging a person up by his heels would be quite as bad as hanging him up by his neck.
10136-8{_}31112{_}It is also a mistake to suppose that rubbing the body with salt and water is of service.--_Proper Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31113{_}Directly a person has been taken out of the water, he should be wiped dry and wrapped in blankets; but if these cannot be obtained, the clothes of the bystanders must be used for the purpose.
10136-8{_}31114{_}His head being slightly raised, and any water, weeds, or froth that may happen to be in his mouth, having been removed, he should be carried as quickly as possible to the nearest house.
10136-8{_}31115{_}He should now be put into a warm bath, about as hot as the hand can pleasantly bear, and kept there for about ten minutes, artificial breathing being had recourse to while he is in it.
10136-8{_}31116{_}Having been taken out of the bath, he should be placed flat on his back, with his head slightly raised, upon a warm bed in a warm room, wiped perfectly dry, and then rubbed constantly all over the body with warm flannels.
10136-8{_}31117{_}At the same time, mustard poultices should be put to the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and the inner surface of the thighs and legs.
10136-8{_}31118{_}Warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, should be placed under the armpits.
10136-8{_}31119{_}The nose should be tickled with a feather, and smelling-salts applied to it.
10136-8{_}31120{_}This treatment should be adopted while the bath is being got ready, as well as when the body has been taken out of it.
10136-8{_}31121{_}The bath is not absolutely necessary; constantly rubbing the body with flannels in a warm room having been found sufficient for resuscitation.
10136-8{_}31122{_}Sir B. Brodie says that warm air is quite as good as warm water.
10136-8{_}31123{_}When symptoms of returning consciousness begin to show themselves, give a little wine, brandy, or twenty drops of sal-volatile and water.
10136-8{_}31124{_}In some cases it is necessary, in about twelve or twenty-four hours after the patient has revived, to bleed him, for peculiar head-symptoms which now and then occur.
10136-8{_}31125{_}Bleeding, however, even in the hands of professional men themselves, should be very cautiously used--non-professional ones should never think of it.
10136-8{_}31126{_}The best thing to do in these cases is to keep the head well raised, and cool with a lotion such as that recommended above for sprains; to administer an aperient draught, and to abstain from giving anything that stimulates, such as wine, brandy, sal-volatile, &c. &c. As a general rule, a person dies in three minutes and a half after he has been under water.
10136-8{_}31127{_}It is difficult, however, to tell how long he has actually been _under_ it, although we may know well exactly how long he has been _in_ it.
10136-8{_}31128{_}This being the case, always persevere in your attempts at resuscitation until actual signs of death have shown themselves, even for six, eight, or ten hours.
10136-8{_}31129{_}Dr. Douglas, of Glasgow, resuscitated a person who had been under water for fourteen minutes, by simply rubbing the whole of his body with warm flannels, in a warm room, for eight hours and a half, at the end of which time the person began to show the _first_ symptoms of returning animation.
10136-8{_}31130{_}Should the accident occur at a great distance from any house, this treatment should be adopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of.
10136-8{_}31131{_}Breathing through any tube, such as a piece of card or paper rolled into the form of a pipe, will do as a substitute for the bellows.
10136-8{_}31132{_}To recapitulate: Rub the body dry; take matters out of mouth; cover with blankets or clothes; slightly raise the head, and place the body in a warm bath, or on a bed in a warm room; apply smelling-salts to nose; employ artificial breathing; rub well with warm flannels; put mustard poultices to feet, hands, and insides of thighs and legs, with warm bricks or bottles to armpits.
10136-8{_}31133{_}_Don't bleed_.
10136-8{_}31134{_}Give wine, brandy, or sal-volatile when recovering, and _persevere till actual signs of death are seen._  2677.
10136-8{_}31135{_}Briefly to conclude what we have to say of suffocation, let us treat of _Lightning_.
10136-8{_}31136{_}When a person has been struck by lightning, there is a general paleness of the whole body, with the exception of the part struck, which is often blackened, or even scorched.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31137{_}Same as for drowning.
10136-8{_}31138{_}It is not, however, of much use; for when death takes place at all, it is generally instantaneous.
10136-8{_}31139{_}2678.
10136-8{_}31140{_}CURE FOR THE TOOTHACHE.--Take a piece of sheet zinc, about the size of a sixpence, and a piece of silver, say a shilling; place them together, and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous to them; in a few minutes the pain will be gone, as if by magic.
10136-8{_}31141{_}The zinc and silver, acting as a galvanic battery, will produce on the nerves of the tooth sufficient electricity to establish a current, and consequently to relieve the pain.
10136-8{_}31142{_}Or smoke a pipe of tobacco and caraway-seeds.
10136-8{_}31143{_}Again--  2679.
10136-8{_}31144{_}A small piece of the pellitory root will, by the flow of saliva it causes, afford relief.
10136-8{_}31145{_}Creosote, or a few drops of tincture of myrrh, or friar's balsam, on cotton, put on the tooth, will often subdue the pain.
10136-8{_}31146{_}A small piece of camphor, however, retained in the mouth, is the most reliable and likely means of conquering the paroxysms of this dreaded enemy.
10136-8{_}31147{_}2680.
10136-8{_}31148{_}WARTS.--Eisenberg says, in his "Advice on the Hand," that the hydrochlorate of lime is the most certain means of destroying warts; the process, however, is very slow, and demands perseverance, for, if discontinued before the proper time, no advantage is gained.
10136-8{_}31149{_}The following is a simple cure:--On breaking the stalk of the crowfoot plant in two, a drop of milky juice will be observed to hang on the upper part of the stem; if this be allowed to drop on a wart, so that it be well saturated with the juice, in about three or four dressings the warts will die, and may be taken off with the fingers.
10136-8{_}31150{_}They may be removed by the above means from the teats of cows, where they are sometimes very troublesome, and prevent them standing quiet to be milked.
10136-8{_}31151{_}The wart touched lightly every second day with lunar caustic, or rubbed every night with blue-stone, for a few weeks, will destroy the largest wart, wherever situated.
10136-8{_}31152{_}2681.
10136-8{_}31153{_}To CURE A WHITLOW.--As soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly, a pretty large piece should be snipped out, so that the watery matter may readily escape, and continue to flow out as fast as produced.
10136-8{_}31154{_}A bread-and-water poultice should be put on for a few days, when the wound should be bound up lightly with some mild ointment, when a cure will be speedily completed.
10136-8{_}31155{_}Constant poulticing both before and after the opening of the whitlow, is the only practice needed; but as the matter lies deep, when it is necessary to open the abscess, the incision must be made _deep_ to reach the suppuration.
10136-8{_}31156{_}2682.
10136-8{_}31157{_}WOUNDS.--There are several kinds of wounds, which are called by different names, according to their appearance, or the manner in which they are produced.
10136-8{_}31158{_}As, however, it would be useless, and even hurtful, to bother the reader's head with too many nice professional distinctions, we shall content ourselves with dividing wounds into three classes.
10136-8{_}31159{_}2683.
10136-8{_}31160{_}1.
10136-8{_}31161{_}_Incised wounds or cuts_--those produced by a knife, or some sharp instrument.
10136-8{_}31162{_}2684.
10136-8{_}31163{_}2.
10136-8{_}31164{_}_Lacerated, or torn wounds_--those produced by the claws of an animal, the bite of a dog, running quickly against some projecting blunt object, such as a nail, &c.  2685.
10136-8{_}31165{_}3.
10136-8{_}31166{_}_Punctured or penetrating wounds_--those produced by anything running deeply into the flesh; such as a sword, a sharp nail, a spike, the point of a bayonet, &c.  2686.
10136-8{_}31167{_}Class 1.
10136-8{_}31168{_}_Incised wounds or cuts_.--The danger arising from these accidents is owing more to their position than to their extent.
10136-8{_}31169{_}Thus, a cut of half an inch long, which goes through an artery, is more serious than a cut of two inches long, which is not near one.
10136-8{_}31170{_}Again, a small cut on the head is more often followed by dangerous symptoms than a much larger one on the legs.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31171{_}If the cut is not a very large one, and no artery or vein is wounded, this is very simple.
10136-8{_}31172{_}If there are any foreign substances left in the wound, they must be taken out, and the bleeding must be quite stopped before the wound is strapped up.
10136-8{_}31173{_}If the bleeding is not very great, it may easily be stopped by raising the cut part, and applying rags dipped in cold water to it.
10136-8{_}31174{_}All clots of blood must be carefully removed; for, if they are left behind, they prevent the wound from healing.
10136-8{_}31175{_}When the bleeding has been stopped, and the wound perfectly cleaned, its two edges are to be brought closely together by thin straps of common adhesive plaster, which should remain on, if there is not great pain or heat about the part, for two or three days, without being removed.
10136-8{_}31176{_}The cut part should be kept raised and cool.
10136-8{_}31177{_}When the strips of plaster are to be taken off, they should first be well bathed with lukewarm water.
10136-8{_}31178{_}This will cause them to come away easily, and without opening the lips of the wound; which accident is very likely to take place, if they are pulled off without having been first moistened with the warm water.
10136-8{_}31179{_}If the wound is not healed when the strips of plaster are taken off, fresh ones must be applied.
10136-8{_}31180{_}Great care is required in treating cuts of the head, as they are often followed by erysipelas taking place round them.
10136-8{_}31181{_}They should be strapped with isinglass plaster, which is much less irritating than the ordinary adhesive plaster.
10136-8{_}31182{_}Only use as many strips as are actually requisite to keep the two edges of the wound together; keep the patient quite quiet, on low diet, for a week or so, according to his symptoms.
10136-8{_}31183{_}Purge him well with the No.
10136-8{_}31184{_}2 pills (five grains of blue pill mixed with the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth; make into two pills, the dose for an adult).
10136-8{_}31185{_}If the patient is feverish, give him two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture three times a day.
10136-8{_}31186{_}(The fever-mixture, we remind our readers, is thus made: Mix a drachm of powdered nitre, 2 drachms of carbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine, and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pint of water.)
10136-8{_}31187{_}A person should be very careful of himself for a month or two after having had a bad cut on the head.
10136-8{_}31188{_}His bowels should be kept constantly open, and all excitement and excess avoided.
10136-8{_}31189{_}When a vein or artery is wounded, the danger is, of course, much greater.
10136-8{_}31190{_}Those accidents, therefore, should always be attended to by a surgeon, if he can possibly be procured.
10136-8{_}31191{_}Before he arrives, however, or in case his assistance cannot be obtained at all, the following treatment should be adopted:--Raise the cut part, and press rags dipped in cold water firmly against it.
10136-8{_}31192{_}This will often be sufficient to stop the bleeding, if the divided artery or vein is not dangerous.
10136-8{_}31193{_}When an artery is divided, the blood is of a bright red colour, and comes away in jets.
10136-8{_}31194{_}In this case, and supposing the leg or arm to be the cut part, a handkerchief is to be tied tightly round the limb _above_ the cut; and, if possible, the two bleeding ends of the artery should each be tied with a piece of silk.
10136-8{_}31195{_}If the bleeding is from a vein, the blood is much darker, and does not come away in jets.
10136-8{_}31196{_}In this case, the handkerchief is to be tied _below_ the cut, and a pad of lint or linen pressed firmly against the divided ends of the vein.
10136-8{_}31197{_}Let every bad cut, especially where there is much bleeding, and even although it may to all appearance have been stopped, be attended to by a surgeon, if one can by any means be obtained.
10136-8{_}31198{_}2687.
10136-8{_}31199{_}Class 2.
10136-8{_}31200{_}_Lacerated or torn wounds_.--There is not so much bleeding in these cases as in clean cuts, because the blood-vessels are torn across in a zigzag manner, and not divided straight across.
10136-8{_}31201{_}In other respects, however, they are more serious than ordinary cuts, being often followed by inflammation, mortification, fever, and in some cases by locked-jaw.
10136-8{_}31202{_}Foreign substances are also more likely to remain in them.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31203{_}Stop the bleeding, if there is any, in the manner directed for cuts; remove all substances that may be in the wound; keep the patient quite quiet, and on low diet--gruel, arrowroot, and the like; purge with the No.
10136-8{_}31204{_}1 pills and the No.
10136-8{_}31205{_}1 mixture.
10136-8{_}31206{_}(The No.
10136-8{_}31207{_}1 pill: Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder, with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills, which is the dose for an adult.
10136-8{_}31208{_}The No.
10136-8{_}31209{_}1 mixture: Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea.
10136-8{_}31210{_}A quarter of the mixture is a dose.)
10136-8{_}31211{_}If there are feverish symptoms, give two tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture (see above) every four hours.
10136-8{_}31212{_}If possible, bring the two edges of the wound together, _but do not strain the parts to do this_.
10136-8{_}31213{_}If they cannot be brought together, on account of a piece of flesh being taken clean out, or the raggedness of their edges, put lint dipped in cold water over the wound, and cover it with oiled silk.
10136-8{_}31214{_}It will then fill up from the bottom.
10136-8{_}31215{_}If the wound, after being well washed, should still contain any sand, or grit of any kind, or if it should get red and hot from inflammation, a large warm bread poultice will be the best thing to apply until it becomes quite clean, or the inflammation goes down.
10136-8{_}31216{_}When the wound is a very large one, the application of warm poppy fomentations is better than that of the lint dipped in cold water.
10136-8{_}31217{_}If the redness and pain about the part, and the general feverish symptoms, are great, from eight to twelve leeches are to be applied round the wound, and a warm poppy fomentation or warm bread poultice applied after they drop off.
10136-8{_}31218{_}2688.
10136-8{_}31219{_}Class 3.
10136-8{_}31220{_}_Punctured or penetrating wounds_.--These, for many reasons, are the most serious of all kinds of wounds.--_Treatment_.
10136-8{_}31221{_}The same as that for lacerated wounds.
10136-8{_}31222{_}Pus (matter) often forms at the bottom of these wounds, which should, therefore, be kept open at the top, by separating their edges every morning with a bodkin, and applying a warm bread poultice immediately afterwards.
10136-8{_}31223{_}They will then, in all probability, heal up from the bottom, and any matter which may form will find its own way out into the poultice.
10136-8{_}31224{_}Sometimes, however, in spite of all precautions, collections of matter (abscesses) will form at the bottom or sides of the wound.
10136-8{_}31225{_}Those are to be opened with a lancet, and the matter thus let out.
10136-8{_}31226{_}When matter is forming, the patient has cold shiverings, throbbing pain in the part, and flushes on the face, which come and go.
10136-8{_}31227{_}A swelling of the part is also often seen.
10136-8{_}31228{_}The matter in the abscesses may be felt to move backwards and forwards, when pressure is made from one side of the swelling to the other with the first and second fingers (the middle and that next the thumb) of each hand.
10136-8{_}31229{_}MEDICAL MEMORANDA.
10136-8{_}31230{_}2689.
10136-8{_}31231{_}ADVANTAGES OF CLEANLINESS.--Health and strength cannot be long continued unless the skin--_all_ the skin--is washed frequently with a sponge or other means.
10136-8{_}31232{_}Every morning is best; after which the skin should be rubbed very well with a rough cloth.
10136-8{_}31233{_}This is the most certain way of preventing cold, and a little substitute for exercise, as it brings blood to the surface, and causes it to circulate well through the fine capillary vessels.
10136-8{_}31234{_}Labour produces this circulation naturally.
10136-8{_}31235{_}The insensible perspiration cannot escape well if the skin is not clean, as the pores get choked up.
10136-8{_}31236{_}It is said that in health about half the aliment we take passes out through the skin.
10136-8{_}31237{_}2690.
10136-8{_}31238{_}THE TOMATO MEDICINAL.--To many persons there is something unpleasant, not to say offensive, in the flavour of this excellent fruit.
10136-8{_}31239{_}It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes in various countries of Europe.
10136-8{_}31240{_}Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties.
10136-8{_}31241{_}He declares:--1.
10136-8{_}31242{_}That the tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the _materia medica_; and that, in all those affections of the liver and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession.
10136-8{_}31243{_}2.
10136-8{_}31244{_}That a chemical extract can be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases.
10136-8{_}31245{_}3.
10136-8{_}31246{_}That he has successfully treated diarrhoea with this article alone.
10136-8{_}31247{_}4.
10136-8{_}31248{_}That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.
10136-8{_}31249{_}2691.
10136-8{_}31250{_}WARM WATER.--Warm water is preferable to cold water, as a drink, to persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints, and it may be taken more freely than cold water, and consequently answers better as a diluent for carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in the urinary secretion, in cases of stone and gravel.
10136-8{_}31251{_}When water of a temperature equal to that of the human body is used for drink, it proves considerably stimulant, and is particularly suited to dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects.
10136-8{_}31252{_}2692.
10136-8{_}31253{_}CAUTIONS IN VISITING SICK-ROOMS.--Never venture into a sick-room if you are in a violent perspiration (if circumstances require your continuance there), for the moment your body becomes cold, it is in a state likely to absorb the infection, and give you the disease.
10136-8{_}31254{_}Nor visit a sick person (especially if the complaint be of a contagious nature) with _an empty stomach_; as this disposes the system more readily to receive the contagion.
10136-8{_}31255{_}In attending a sick person, place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the diseased, not betwixt the diseased person and any fire that is in the room, as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapour in that direction, and you would run much danger from breathing it.
10136-8{_}31256{_}2693.
10136-8{_}31257{_}NECESSITY OF GOOD VENTILATION IN ROOMS LIGHTED WITH GAS.--In dwelling-houses lighted by gas, the frequent renewal of the air is of great importance.
10136-8{_}31258{_}A single gas-burner will consume more oxygen, and produce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere of a room, than six or eight candles.
10136-8{_}31259{_}If, therefore, when several burners are used, no provision is made for the escape of the corrupted air and for the introduction of pure air from without, the health will necessarily suffer.
10136-8{_}31260{_}LEGAL MEMORANDA.
10136-8{_}31261{_}CHAPTER XLIV.
10136-8{_}31262{_}2694.
10136-8{_}31263{_}Humorists tell us there is no act of our lives which can be performed without breaking through some one of the many meshes of the law by which our rights are so carefully guarded; and those learned in the law, when they do give advice without the usual fee, and in the confidence of friendship, generally say, "Pay, pay anything rather than go to law;" while those having experience in the courts of Themis have a wholesome dread of its pitfalls.
10136-8{_}31264{_}There are a few exceptions, however, to this fear of the law's uncertainties; and we hear of those to whom a lawsuit is on agreeable relaxation, a gentle excitement.
10136-8{_}31265{_}One of this class, when remonstrated with, retorted, that while one friend kept dogs, and another horses, he, as he had a right to do, kept a lawyer; and no one had a right to dispute his taste.
10136-8{_}31266{_}We cannot pretend, in these few pages, to lay down even the principles of law, not to speak of its contrary exposition in different courts; but there are a few acts of legal import which all men--and women too--must perform; and to these acts we may be useful in giving a right direction.
10136-8{_}31267{_}There is a house to be leased or purchased, servants to be engaged, a will to be made, or property settled, in all families; and much of the welfare of its members depends on these things being done in proper legal form.
10136-8{_}31268{_}2695.
10136-8{_}31269{_}PURCHASING A HOUSE.--Few men will venture to purchase a freehold, or even a leasehold property, by private contract, without making themselves acquainted with the locality, and employing a solicitor to examine the titles,; but many do walk into an auction-room, and bid for a property upon the representations of the auctioneer.
10136-8{_}31270{_}The conditions, whatever they are, will bind him; for by one of the legal fictions of which we have still so many, the auctioneer, who is in reality the agent for the vendor, becomes also the agent for the buyer, and by putting down the names of bidders and the biddings, he binds him to whom the lot is knocked down to the sale and the conditions,--the falling of the auctioneer's hammer is the acceptance of the offer, which completes the agreement to purchase.
10136-8{_}31271{_}In any such transaction you can only look at the written or printed particulars; any verbal statement of the auctioneer, made at the time of the sale, cannot contradict them, and they are implemented by the agreement, which the auctioneer calls on the purchaser to sign after the sale.
10136-8{_}31272{_}You should sign no such contract without having a duplicate of it signed by the auctioneer, and delivered to you.
10136-8{_}31273{_}It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that no trustee or assignee can purchase property for himself included in the trust, even at auction; nor is it safe to pay the purchase money to an agent of the vendor, unless he give a written authority to the agent to receive it, besides handing over the requisite deeds and receipts.
10136-8{_}31274{_}2696.
10136-8{_}31275{_}The laws of purchase and sale of property are so complicated that Lord St. Leonards devotes five chapters of his book on Property Law to the subject.
10136-8{_}31276{_}The only circumstances strong enough to vitiate a purchase, which has been reduced to a written contract, is proof of fraudulent representation as to an encumbrance of which the buyer was ignorant, or a defect in title; but every circumstance which the purchaser might have learned by careful investigation, the law presumes that he did know.
10136-8{_}31277{_}Thus, in buying a leasehold estate or house, all the covenants of the original lease are presumed to be known.
10136-8{_}31278{_}"It is not unusual," says Lord St. Leonards, "to stipulate, in conditions of sale of leasehold property, that the production of a receipt for the last year's rent shall be accepted as proof that all the lessor's covenants were performed up to that period.
10136-8{_}31279{_}Never bid for one clogged with such a condition.
10136-8{_}31280{_}There are some acts against which no relief can be obtained; for example, the tenant's right to insure, or his insuring in an office or in names not authorized in the lease.
10136-8{_}31281{_}And you should not rely upon the mere fact of the insurance being correct at the time of sale: there may have been a prior breach of covenant, and the landlord may not have waived his right of entry for the forfeiture."
10136-8{_}31282{_}And where any doubt of this kind exists, the landlord should be appealed to.
10136-8{_}31283{_}2697.
10136-8{_}31284{_}Interest on a purchase is due from the day fixed upon for completing: where it cannot be completed, the loss rests with the party with whom the delay rests; but it appears, when the delay rests with the seller, and the money is lying idle, notice of that is to be given to the seller to make him liable to the loss of interest.
10136-8{_}31285{_}In law, the property belongs to the purchaser from the date of the contract; he is entitled to any benefit, and must bear any loss; the seller may suffer the insurance to drop without giving notice; and should a fire take place, the loss falls on the buyer.
10136-8{_}31286{_}In agreeing to buy a house, therefore, provide at the same time for its insurance.
10136-8{_}31287{_}Common fixtures pass with the house, where nothing is said about them.
10136-8{_}31288{_}2698.
10136-8{_}31289{_}There are some well-recognized laws, of what may be called good-neighbourhood, which affect all properties.
10136-8{_}31290{_}If you purchase a field or house, the seller retaining another field between yours and the highway, he must of necessity grant you a right of way.
10136-8{_}31291{_}Where the owner of more than one house sells one of them, the purchaser is entitled to benefit by all drains leading from his house into other drains, and will be subject to all necessary drains for the adjoining houses, although there is no express reservation as to drains.
10136-8{_}31292{_}Thus, if his happens to be a leading drain, other necessary drains may be opened into it.
10136-8{_}31293{_}In purchasing land for building on, you should expressly reserve a right to make an opening into any sewer or watercourse on the vendor's land for drainage purposes.
10136-8{_}31294{_}2699.
10136-8{_}31295{_}CONSTRUCTIONS.--Among the cautions which purchasers of houses, land, or leaseholds, should keep in view, is a not inconsiderable array of _constructive_ notices, which are equally binding with actual ones.
10136-8{_}31296{_}Notice to your attorney or agent is notice to you; and when the same attorney is employed by both parties, and he is aware of an encumbrance of which you are ignorant, you are bound by it; even where the vendor is guilty of a fraud to which your agent is privy, you are responsible, and cannot be released from the consequences.
10136-8{_}31297{_}2700.
10136-8{_}31298{_}THE RELATIONS OF LANDLORD AND TENANT are most important to both parties, and each should clearly understand his position.
10136-8{_}31299{_}The proprietor of a house, or house and land, agrees to let it either to a tenant-at-will, a yearly tenancy, or under lease.
10136-8{_}31300{_}A tenancy-at-will may be created by parol or by agreement; and as the tenant may be turned out when his landlord pleases, so he may leave when he himself thinks proper; but this kind of tenancy is extremely inconvenient to both parties.
10136-8{_}31301{_}Where an annual rent is attached to the tenancy, in construction of law, a lease or agreement without limitation to any certain period is a lease from year to year, and both landlord and tenant are entitled to notice before the tenancy can be determined by the other.
10136-8{_}31302{_}This notice must be given at least six months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy, and it can only terminate at the end of any whole year from the time at which it began; so that the tenant entering into possession at Midsummer, the notice must be given to or by him, so as to terminate at the same term.
10136-8{_}31303{_}When once he is in possession, he has a right to remain for a whole year; and if no notice be given at the end of the first half-year of his tenancy, he will have to remain two years, and so on for any number of years.
10136-8{_}31304{_}2701.
10136-8{_}31305{_}TENANCY BY SUFFERANCE.--This is a tenancy, not very uncommon, arising out of the unwillingness of either party to take the initiative in a more decided course at the expiry of a lease or agreement.
10136-8{_}31306{_}The tenant remains in possession, and continues to pay rent as before, and becomes, from sufferance, a tenant from year to year, which can only be terminated by one party or the other giving the necessary six months' notice to quit at the term corresponding with the commencement of the original tenancy.
10136-8{_}31307{_}This tenancy at sufferance applies also to an under-tenant, who remains in possession and pays rent to the reversioner or head landlord.
10136-8{_}31308{_}A six months' notice will be insufficient for this tenancy.
10136-8{_}31309{_}A notice was given (in Right v. Darby, I.T.R.
10136-8{_}31310{_}159) to quit a house held by plaintiff as tenant from year to year, on the 17th June, 1840, requiring him "to quit the premises on the 11th October following, or such other day as his said tenancy might expire."
10136-8{_}31311{_}The tenancy had commenced on the 11th October in a former year, but it was held that this was not a good notice for the year ending October 11, 1841.
10136-8{_}31312{_}A tenant from year to year gave his landlord notice to quit, ending the tenancy at a time within the half-year; the landlord acquiesced at first, but afterwards refused to accept the notice.
10136-8{_}31313{_}The tenant quitted the premises; the landlord entered, and even made some repairs, but it was afterwards held that the tenancy was not determined.
10136-8{_}31314{_}A notice to quit must be such as the tenant may safely act on at the time of receiving it; therefore it can only be given by an agent properly authorized at the time, and cannot be made good by the landlord adopting it afterwards.
10136-8{_}31315{_}An unqualified notice, given at the proper time, should conclude with "On failure whereof, I shall require you to pay me double the former rent for so long as you retain possession."
10136-8{_}31316{_}2702.
10136-8{_}31317{_}LEASES.--A lease is an instrument in writing, by which one person grants to another the occupation and use of lands or tenements for a term of years for a consideration, the lessor granting the lease, and the lessee accepting it with all its conditions.
10136-8{_}31318{_}A lessor may grant the lease for any term less than his own interest.
10136-8{_}31319{_}A tenant for life in an estate can only grant a lease for his own life.
10136-8{_}31320{_}A tenant for life, having power to grant a lease, should grant it only in the terms of the power, otherwise the lease is void, and his estate may be made to pay heavy penalties under the covenant, usually the only one onerous on the lessor, for quiet enjoyment.
10136-8{_}31321{_}The proprietor of a freehold--that is, of the possession in perpetuity of lands or tenements--may grant a lease for 999 years, for 99 years, or for 3 years.
10136-8{_}31322{_}In the latter case, the lease may be either verbal or in writing, no particular form and no stamps being necessary, except the usual stamp on agreements; so long as the intention of the parties is clearly expressed, and the covenants definite, and well understood by each party, the agreement is complete, and the law satisfied.
10136-8{_}31323{_}In the case of settled estates, the court of Chancery is empowered to authorize leases under the 19 & 20 Vict.
10136-8{_}31324{_}c. 120, and 21 & 22 Vict.
10136-8{_}31325{_}c. 77, as follows:--    21 years for agriculture or occupation.
10136-8{_}31326{_}40 years for water-power.
10136-8{_}31327{_}99 years for building-leases.
10136-8{_}31328{_}60 years for repairing-leases.
10136-8{_}31329{_}2703.
10136-8{_}31330{_}A lessor may also grant an under-lease for a term less than his own: to grant the whole of his term would be an assignment.
10136-8{_}31331{_}Leases are frequently burdened with a covenant not to underlet without the consent of the landlord: this is a covenant sometimes very onerous, and to be avoided, where it is possible, by a prudent lessee.
10136-8{_}31332{_}2704.
10136-8{_}31333{_}A lease for any term beyond three years, whether an actual lease or an agreement for one, must be in the form of a deed; that is, it must be "under seal;" and all assignments and surrenders of leases must be in the same form, or they are _void at law_.
10136-8{_}31334{_}Thus an agreement made by letter, or by a memorandum of agreement, which would be binding in most cases, would be valueless when it was for a lease, unless witnessed, and given under hand and seal.
10136-8{_}31335{_}The last statute, 8 & 9 Vict.
10136-8{_}31336{_}c. 106, under which these precautions became necessary, has led to serious difficulties.
10136-8{_}31337{_}"The judges," says Lord St. Leonards, "feel the difficulty of holding a lease in writing, but not by deed, to be altogether void, and consequently decided, that although such a lease is void under the statute, yet it so far regulates the holding, that it creates a tenancy from year to year, terminable by half a year's notice; and if the tenure endure for the term attempted to be created by the void lease, the tenant may be evicted at the end of the term without any notice to quit."
10136-8{_}31338{_}An agreement for a lease not by deed has been construed to be a lease for a term of years, and consequently void under the statute; "and yet," says Lord St. Leonards, "a court of equity has held that it may be specifically enforced as an agreement upon the terms stated."
10136-8{_}31339{_}The law on this point is one of glorious uncertainty; in making any such agreement, therefore, we should be careful to express that it is an agreement, and not a lease; and that it is witnessed and under seal.
10136-8{_}31340{_}2705.
10136-8{_}31341{_}AGREEMENTS.--It is usual, where the lease is a repairing one, to agree for a lease to be granted on completion of repairs according to specification.
10136-8{_}31342{_}This agreement should contain the names and designation of the parties, a description of the property, and the term of the intended lease, and all the covenants which are to be inserted, as no verbal agreement can be made to a written agreement.
10136-8{_}31343{_}It should also declare that the instrument is an agreement for a lease, and not the lease itself.
10136-8{_}31344{_}The points to be settled in such an agreement are, the rent, term, and especially covenants for insuring and rebuilding in the event of a fire; and if it is intended that the lessor's consent is to be obtained before assigning or underleasing, a covenant to that effect is required in the agreement.
10136-8{_}31345{_}In building-leases, usually granted for 99 years, the tenant is to insure the property; and even where the agreement is silent on that point, the law decides it so.
10136-8{_}31346{_}It is otherwise with ordinary tenements, when the tenant pays a full, or what the law terms rack-rent; the landlord is then to insure, unless it is otherwise arranged by the agreement.
10136-8{_}31347{_}2706.
10136-8{_}31348{_}It is important for lessee, and lessor, also, that the latter does not exceed his powers.
10136-8{_}31349{_}A lease granted by a tenant for life before he is properly in possession, is void in law; for, although a court of equity, according to Lord St. Leonards, will, "by force of its own jurisdiction, support a _bonâ fide_ lease, granted under a power which is merely erroneous in form or ceremonies," and the 12 & 13 Vict.
10136-8{_}31350{_}c. 26, and 13 & 14 Vict.
10136-8{_}31351{_}c. 19, compel a new lease to be granted with the necessary variations, while the lessor has no power to compel him to accept such a lease, except when the person in remainder is competent and willing to confirm the original lease without variations, yet all these difficulties involve both delay, costs, and anxieties.
10136-8{_}31352{_}2707.
10136-8{_}31353{_}In husbandry leases, a covenant to cultivate the land in a husbandlike manner, and according to the custom of the district, is always implied; but it is more usual to prescribe the course of tillage which is to be pursued.
10136-8{_}31354{_}In the case of houses for occupation, the tenant would have to keep the house in a tenantable state of repair during the term, and deliver it up in like condition.
10136-8{_}31355{_}This is not the case with the tenant at will, or from year to year, where the landlord has to keep the house in tenantable repair, and the tenant is only liable for waste beyond reasonable wear and tear.
10136-8{_}31356{_}2708.
10136-8{_}31357{_}INSURANCE.--Every lease, or agreement for a lease, should covenant not only who is to pay insurance, but how the tenement is to be rebuilt in the event of a fire; for if the house were burnt down, and no provision made for insurance, the tenant, supposing there was the ordinary covenant to repair in the lease, would not only have to rebuild, but to pay rent while it was being rebuilt.
10136-8{_}31358{_}More than this, supposing, under the same lease, the landlord had taken the precaution of insuring, he is not compelled to lay out the money recovered in rebuilding the premises.
10136-8{_}31359{_}Sir John Leach lays it down, that "the tenant's situation could not be changed by a precaution, on the part of the landlord, with which he had nothing to do."
10136-8{_}31360{_}This decision Lord Campbell confirmed in a more recent case, in which an action was brought against a lessee who was not bound to repair, and neither he nor the landlord bound to insure; admitting an equitable defence, the court affirmed Sir John Leach's decision, holding that the tenant was bound to pay the rent, and could not require the landlord to lay out the insurance money in rebuilding.
10136-8{_}31361{_}This is opposed to the opinion of Lord St. Leonards, who admits, however, that the decision of the court must overrule his _dictum_.
10136-8{_}31362{_}Such being the state of the law, it is very important that insurance should be provided for, and that the payment of rent should be made to depend upon rebuilding the house in the event of a fire.
10136-8{_}31363{_}Care must be taken, however, that this is made a covenant of the lease, as well as in the agreement, otherwise the tenant must rebuild the house.
10136-8{_}31364{_}2709.
10136-8{_}31365{_}The law declares that a tenant is not bound to repair damages by tempest, lightning, or other natural casualty, unless there is a special covenant to that effect in the lease; but if there is a general covenant to repair, the repair will fall upon the tenant.
10136-8{_}31366{_}Lord Kenyon lays it down, in the case of a bridge destroyed by a flood, the tenant being under a general covenant to repair, that, "where a party, by his own contract, creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it good, because he might have guarded against it in the contract."
10136-8{_}31367{_}The same principle of law has been applied to a house destroyed by lightning.
10136-8{_}31368{_}It is, therefore, important to have this settled in the insurance clause.
10136-8{_}31369{_}2710.
10136-8{_}31370{_}Lord St. Leonards asserts that "his policies against fire are not so framed as to render the company _legally_ liable."
10136-8{_}31371{_}Generally the property is inaccurately described with reference to the conditions under which you insure.
10136-8{_}31372{_}They are framed by companies who, probably, are not unwilling to have a legal defence against any claim, as they intend to pay what they deem just claim without taking advantage of any technical objection, and intending to make use of their defence only against what they believe to be a fraud, although they may not be able to prove it.
10136-8{_}31373{_}"But," says his lordship, "do not rely upon the moral feelings of the directors.
10136-8{_}31374{_}Ascertain that your house falls strictly within the conditions.
10136-8{_}31375{_}Even having the surveyor of the company to look over your house before the insurance will not save you, unless your policy is correct."
10136-8{_}31376{_}This is true; but probably his lordship's legal jealousy overshoots the mark here.
10136-8{_}31377{_}Assurance companies only require an honest statement of the facts, and that no concealment is practised with their surveyor; and the case of his own, which he quotes, in which a glass door led into a conservatory, rendering it, according to the view of the company, "hazardous," and consequently voiding the policy, when a fire did occur, the company paid, rather than try the question; but even after the fire they demurred, when called upon, to make the description correct and indorse on the policy the fact that the drawing-room opened through a glass door into conservatories.
10136-8{_}31378{_}One of two inferences is obvious here; either his lordship has overcoloured the statement, or the company could not be the respectable one represented.
10136-8{_}31379{_}The practice with all reputable offices is to survey the premises before insurance, and to describe them as they appear; but no concealment of stoves, or other dangerous accessories or inflammable goods, should be practised.
10136-8{_}31380{_}This certainly binds the office so long as no change takes place; but the addition of any stove, opening, or door through a party wall, the introduction of gunpowder, saltpetre, or other inflammable articles into the premises without notice, very properly "voids the policy."
10136-8{_}31381{_}The usual course is to give notice of all alterations, and have them indorse on the policy, as additions to the description of the property: there is little fear, where this is honestly done, that any company would adopt the sharp practice hinted at in Lord St. Leonards' excellent handy book.
10136-8{_}31382{_}2711.
10136-8{_}31383{_}BREAKS IN THE LEASE.--Where a lease is for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, the option to determine it at the end of the first term is in the tenant, unless it is distinctly agreed that the option shall be mutual, according to Lord St. Leonards.
10136-8{_}31384{_}2712.
10136-8{_}31385{_}NOXIOUS TRADES.--A clause is usually introduced prohibiting the carrying on of any trade in some houses, and of noxious or particular trades in others.
10136-8{_}31386{_}This clause should be jealously inspected, otherwise great annoyance may be produced.
10136-8{_}31387{_}It has been held that a general clause of this description prohibited a tenant from keeping a school, for which he had taken it, although a lunatic asylum and public-house have been found admissible; the keeping an asylum not being deemed a trade, which is defined as "conducted by buying and selling."
10136-8{_}31388{_}It is better to have the trades, or class of trades objected to, defined in the lease.
10136-8{_}31389{_}2713.
10136-8{_}31390{_}FIXTURES.--In houses held under lease, it has been the practice with landlords to lease the bare walls of the tenement only, leaving the lessee to put in the stoves, cupboards, and such other conveniences as he requires, at his own option.
10136-8{_}31391{_}Those, except under particular circumstances, are the property of the lessee, and may either be sold to an incoming tenant, or removed at the end of his term.
10136-8{_}31392{_}The articles which may not be removed are subject to considerable doubt, and are a fruitful source of dispute.
10136-8{_}31393{_}Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque has defined as tenants' property all goods and chattels; 2ndly, all articles "slightly connected one with another, and with the freehold, but capable of being separated without materially injuring the freehold;" 3rdly, articles fixed to the freehold by nails and screws, bolts or pegs, are also tenants' goods and chattels; but when sunk in the soil, or built on it, they are integral parts of the freehold, and cannot be removed.
10136-8{_}31394{_}Thus, a greenhouse or conservatory attached to the house by the tenant is not removable; but the furnace and hot-water pipes by which it is heated, may be removed or sold to the in-coming tenant.
10136-8{_}31395{_}A brick flue does not come under the same category, but remains.
10136-8{_}31396{_}Window-blinds, grates, stoves, coffee-mills, and, in a general sense, everything he has placed which can be removed without injury to the freehold, he may remove, if they are separated from the tenement during his term, and the place made good.
10136-8{_}31397{_}It is not unusual to leave the fixtures in their place, with an undertaking from the landlord that, when again let, the in-coming tenant shall pay for them, or permit their removal.
10136-8{_}31398{_}In a recent case, however, a tenant having held over beyond his term and not removed his fixtures, the landlord let the premises to a new tenant, who entered into possession, and would not allow the fixtures to be removed--it was held by the courts, on trial, that he was justified.
10136-8{_}31399{_}A similar case occurred to the writer: he left his fixtures in the house, taking a letter from the landlord, undertaking that the in-coming tenant should pay for them by valuation, or permit their removal.
10136-8{_}31400{_}The house was let; the landlord died.
10136-8{_}31401{_}His executors, on being applied to, pleaded ignorance, as did the tenant, and on being furnished with a copy of the letter, the executors told applicant that if he was aggrieved, he knew his remedy; namely, an action at law.
10136-8{_}31402{_}He thought the first loss the least, and has not altered his opinion.
10136-8{_}31403{_}2714.
10136-8{_}31404{_}TAXES.--Land-tax, sewers-rate, and property-tax, are landlord's taxes; but by 30 Geo.
10136-8{_}31405{_}II.
10136-8{_}31406{_}c. 2, the occupier is required to pay all rates levied, and deduct from the rent such taxes as belong to the landlord.
10136-8{_}31407{_}Many landlords now insert a covenant, stipulating that land-tax and sewers-rate are to be paid by the tenants, and not deducted: this does not apply to the property-tax.
10136-8{_}31408{_}All other taxes and rates are payable by the occupier.
10136-8{_}31409{_}2715.
10136-8{_}31410{_}WATER-RATE, of course, is paid by the tenant.
10136-8{_}31411{_}The water-companies, as well as gas-companies, have the power of cutting off the supply; and most of them have also the right of distraining, in the same manner as landlords have for rent.
10136-8{_}31412{_}2716.
10136-8{_}31413{_}NOTICE TO QUIT.--In the case of leasing for a term, no notice is necessary; the tenant quits, as a matter of course, at its termination; or if, by tacit consent, he remains paying rent as heretofore, he becomes a tenant at sufferance, or from year to year.
10136-8{_}31414{_}Half a year's notice now becomes necessary, as we have already seen, to terminate the tenancy; except in London, and the rent is under forty shillings, when a quarter's notice is sufficient.
10136-8{_}31415{_}Either of these notices may be given verbally, if it can be proved that the notice was definite, and given at the right time.
10136-8{_}31416{_}Form of notice is quite immaterial, provided it is definite and clear in its purport.
10136-8{_}31417{_}2717.
10136-8{_}31418{_}Tenancy for less than a year may be terminated according to the taking.
10136-8{_}31419{_}Thus, when taken for three months, a three months' notice is required; when monthly, a month's notice; and when weekly, a week's notice; but weekly tenancy is changed to a quarterly tenure if the rent is allowed to stand over for three months.
10136-8{_}31420{_}When taken for a definite time, as a month, a week, or a quarter, no notice is necessary on either side.
10136-8{_}31421{_}2718.
10136-8{_}31422{_}DILAPIDATIONS.--At the termination of a lease, supposing he has not done so before, a landlord can, and usually does, send a surveyor to report upon the condition of the tenement, and it becomes his duty to ferret out every defect.
10136-8{_}31423{_}A litigious landlord may drag the outgoing tenant into an expensive lawsuit, which he has no power to prevent.
10136-8{_}31424{_}He may even compel him to pay for repairing improvements which he has effected in the tenement itself, if dilapidations exist.
10136-8{_}31425{_}When the lessor covenants to do all repairs, and fails to do so, the lessee may repair, and deduct the cost from the rent.
10136-8{_}31426{_}2719.
10136-8{_}31427{_}RECOVERY OF RENT.--The remedies placed in the hands of landlords are very stringent.
10136-8{_}31428{_}The day after rent falls due, he may proceed to recover it, by action at law, by distress on the premises, or by action of ejectment, if the rent is half a year in arrear.
10136-8{_}31429{_}Distress is the remedy usually applied, the landlord being authorized to enter the premises, seize the goods and chattels of his tenant, and sell them, on the fifth day, to reimburse himself for all arrears of rent and the charges of the distress.
10136-8{_}31430{_}There are a few exceptions; but, generally, all goods found on the premises may be seized.
10136-8{_}31431{_}The exceptions are--dogs, rabbits, poultry, fish, tools and implements of a man's trade actually in use, the books of a scholar, the axe of a carpenter, wearing apparel on the person, a horse at the plough, or a horse he may be riding, a watch in the pocket, loose money, deeds, writings, the cattle at a smithy forge, corn sent to a mill for grinding, cattle and goods of a guest at an inn; but, curiously enough, carriages and horses standing at livery at the same inn may be taken.
10136-8{_}31432{_}Distress can only be levied in the daytime, and if made after the tender of arrears, it is illegal.
10136-8{_}31433{_}If tender is made after the distress, but before it is _impounded_, the landlord must abandon the distress and bear the cost himself.
10136-8{_}31434{_}Nothing of a perishable nature, which cannot be restored in the same condition--as milk, fruit, and the like, must be taken.
10136-8{_}31435{_}2720.
10136-8{_}31436{_}The law does not regard a day as consisting of portions.
10136-8{_}31437{_}The popular notion that a notice to quit should be served before noon is an error.
10136-8{_}31438{_}Although distraint is one of the remedies, it is seldom advisable in a landlord to resort to distraining for the recovery of rent.
10136-8{_}31439{_}If a tenant cannot pay his rent, the sooner he leaves the premises the better.
10136-8{_}31440{_}If he be a rogue and won't pay, he will probably know that nine out of ten distresses are illegal, through the carelessness, ignorance, or extortion of the brokers who execute them.
10136-8{_}31441{_}Many, if not most, of the respectable brokers will not execute distresses, and the business falls into the hands of persons whom it is by no means desirable to employ.
10136-8{_}31442{_}2721.
10136-8{_}31443{_}Powers to relieve landlords of premises, by giving them legal possession, are given by 19 & 20 Vict., cap.
10136-8{_}31444{_}108, to the county courts, in cases where the rent does not exceed £50 per annum, and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned; i.e.
10136-8{_}31445{_}:--      1.
10136-8{_}31446{_}Where the term has expired, or been determined by notice to     quit.
10136-8{_}31447{_}2.
10136-8{_}31448{_}Where there is one half-year's rent in arrear, and _the     landlord shall have right by law to enter for the nonpayment     thereof_.
10136-8{_}31449{_}As proof of this power is required, the importance of     including such a power in the agreement for tenancy will be     obvious.
10136-8{_}31450{_}In the county courts the amount of rent due may be claimed, as well as the possession of the premises, in one summons.
10136-8{_}31451{_}2722.
10136-8{_}31452{_}When a tenant deserts premises, leaving one half-year's rent in arrear, possession may be recovered by means of the police-court.
10136-8{_}31453{_}The rent must not exceed £20 per annum, and must be at least three-fourths of the value of the premises.
10136-8{_}31454{_}In cases in which the tenant has not deserted the premises, and where notice to quit has been given and has expired, the landlord must give notice to the tenant of his intended application.
10136-8{_}31455{_}The annual rent in this case, also, must not exceed £20.
10136-8{_}31456{_}2723.
10136-8{_}31457{_}THE I. O.
10136-8{_}31458{_}U.--The law is not particular as to orthography; in fact, it distinctly refuses to recognize the existence of that delightful science.
10136-8{_}31459{_}You may bring your action against Mr. Jacob Phillips, under the fanciful denomination of Jaycobb Fillipse, if you like, and the law won't care, because the law goes by ear; and, although it insists upon having everything written, things written are only supposed in law to have any meaning when read, which is, after all, a common-sense rule enough.
10136-8{_}31460{_}So, instead of "I owe you," persons of a cheerful disposition, so frequently found connected with debt, used to write facetiously I. O. U., and the law approved of their so doing.
10136-8{_}31461{_}An I. O. U. is nothing more than a written admission of a debt, and may run thus:--                                             15th October, 1860.
10136-8{_}31462{_}To Mr. W. BROWN.
10136-8{_}31463{_}I. O. U. ten pounds for coals.
10136-8{_}31464{_}£10.
10136-8{_}31465{_}JOHN JONES.
10136-8{_}31466{_}If to this you add the time of payment, as "payable in one month from this date," your I. O. U. is worthless and illegal; for it thus ceases to be a mere acknowledgment, and becomes a promissory note.
10136-8{_}31467{_}Now a promissory note requires a stamp, which an I. O. U. does not.
10136-8{_}31468{_}Many persons, nevertheless, stick penny stamps upon them, probably for ornamental effect, or to make them look serious and authoritative.
10136-8{_}31469{_}If for the former purpose, the postage-stamp looks better than the receipt stamp upon blue paper.
10136-8{_}31470{_}If you are W. Brown, and you didn't see the I. O. U. signed, and can't find anybody who knows Jones's autograph, and Jones won't pay, the I. O. U. will be of no use to you in the county court, except to make the judge laugh.
10136-8{_}31471{_}He will, however, allow you to prove the consideration, and as, of course, you won't be prepared to do anything of the sort, he will, if you ask him politely, adjourn the hearing for a week, when you can produce the coalheavers who delivered the article, and thus gain a glorious victory.
10136-8{_}31472{_}2724.
10136-8{_}31473{_}APPRENTICES.--By the statute 5 Eliz.
10136-8{_}31474{_}cap.
10136-8{_}31475{_}4, it is enacted that, in cases of ill-usage by masters towards apprentices, or of neglect of duty by apprentices, the complaining party may apply to a justice of the peace, who may make such order as equity may require.
10136-8{_}31476{_}If, for want of conformity on the part of the master, this cannot be done, then the master may be bound to appear at the next sessions.
10136-8{_}31477{_}Authority is given by the act to the justices in sessions to discharge the apprentice from his indentures.
10136-8{_}31478{_}They are also empowered, on proof of misbehaviour of the apprentice, to order him to be corrected or imprisoned with hard labour.
10136-8{_}31479{_}2725.
10136-8{_}31480{_}HUSBAND AND WIFE.--Contrary to the vulgar opinion, second cousins, as well as first, may legally marry.
10136-8{_}31481{_}When married, a husband is liable for his wife's debts contracted before marriage.
10136-8{_}31482{_}A creditor desirous of suing for such a claim should proceed against both.
10136-8{_}31483{_}It will, however, be sufficient if the husband be served with process, the names of both appearing therein, thus:--John Jones and Ann his wife.
10136-8{_}31484{_}A married woman, if sued alone, may plead her marriage, or, as it is called in law, coverture.
10136-8{_}31485{_}The husband is liable for debts of his wife contracted for necessaries while living with him.
10136-8{_}31486{_}If she voluntarily leaves his protection, this liability ceases.
10136-8{_}31487{_}He is also liable for any debts contracted by her with his authority.
10136-8{_}31488{_}If the husband have abjured the realm, or been transported by a sentence of law, the wife is liable during his absence, as if she were a single woman, for debts contracted by her.
10136-8{_}31489{_}2726.
10136-8{_}31490{_}In civil cases, a wife may now give evidence on behalf of her husband in criminal cases she can neither be a witness for or against her husband.
10136-8{_}31491{_}The case of assault by him upon her forms an exception to this rule.
10136-8{_}31492{_}2727.
10136-8{_}31493{_}The law does not at this day admit the ancient principle of allowing moderate correction by a husband upon the person of his wife.
10136-8{_}31494{_}Although this is said to have been anciently limited to the use of "a stick not bigger than the thumb," this barbarity is now altogether exploded.
10136-8{_}31495{_}He may, notwithstanding, as has been recently shown in the famous Agapemone case, keep her under restraint, to prevent her leaving him, provided this be effected without cruelty.
10136-8{_}31496{_}2728.
10136-8{_}31497{_}By the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, a wife deserted by her husband may apply to a magistrate, or to the petty sessions, for an order to protect her lawful earnings or property acquired by her after such desertion, from her husband and his creditors.
10136-8{_}31498{_}In this case it is indispensable that such order shall, within ten days, be entered at the county court of the district within which she resides.
10136-8{_}31499{_}It will be seen that the basis of an application for such an order is _desertion_.
10136-8{_}31500{_}Consequently, where the parties have separated by common consent, such an order cannot be obtained, any previous cruelty or misconduct on the husband's part notwithstanding.
10136-8{_}31501{_}2729.
10136-8{_}31502{_}When a husband allows his wife to invest money in her own name in a savings-bank, and he survives her, it is sometimes the rule of such establishments to compel him to take out administration in order to receive such money, although it is questionable whether such rule is legally justifiable.
10136-8{_}31503{_}Widows and widowers pay no legacy-duty for property coming to them through their deceased partners.
10136-8{_}31504{_}2730.
10136-8{_}31505{_}RECEIPTS for sums above £2 should now be given upon penny stamps.
10136-8{_}31506{_}A bill of exchange may nevertheless be discharged by an indorsement stating that it has been paid, and this will not be liable to the stamp.
10136-8{_}31507{_}A receipt is not, as commonly supposed, conclusive evidence as to a payment.
10136-8{_}31508{_}It is only what the law terms _primâ facie_ evidence; that is, good until contradicted or explained.
10136-8{_}31509{_}Thus, if A sends wares or merchandise to B, with a receipt, as a hint that the transaction is intended to be for ready money, and B detain the receipt without paying the cash, A will be at liberty to prove the circumstances and to recover his claim.
10136-8{_}31510{_}The evidence to rebut the receipt must, however, be clear and indubitable, as, after all, written evidence is of a stronger nature than oral testimony.
10136-8{_}31511{_}2731.
10136-8{_}31512{_}BOOKS OF ACCOUNT.--A tradesman's books of account cannot be received as evidence in his own behalf, unless the entries therein be proved to have been brought under the notice of, and admitted to be correct by the other party, as is commonly the case with the "pass-books" employed backwards and forwards between bakers, butchers, and the like domestic traders, and their customers.
10136-8{_}31513{_}The defendant may, however, compel the tradesman to produce his books to show entries adverse to his own claim.
10136-8{_}31514{_}2732.
10136-8{_}31515{_}WILLS.--The last proof of affection which we can give to those left behind, is to leave their worldly affairs in such a state as to excite neither jealousy, nor anger, nor heartrendings of any kind, at least for the immediate future.
10136-8{_}31516{_}This can only be done by a just, clear, and intelligible disposal of whatever there is to leave.
10136-8{_}31517{_}Without being advocates for every man being his own lawyer, it is not to be denied that the most elaborately prepared wills have been the most fruitful sources of litigation, and it has even happened that learned judges left wills behind them which could not be carried out.
10136-8{_}31518{_}Except in cases where the property is in land or in leases of complicated tenure, very elaborate details are unnecessary; and we counsel no man to use words in making his will of which he does not perfectly understand the meaning and import.
10136-8{_}31519{_}2733.
10136-8{_}31520{_}All men over twenty-one years of age, and of sound mind, and all unmarried women of like age and sanity, may by will bequeath their property to whom they please.
10136-8{_}31521{_}Infants, that is, all persons under twenty-one years of age, and married women, except where they have an estate to their "own separate use," are incapacitated, without the concurrence of the husband; the law taking the disposal of any property they die possessed of.
10136-8{_}31522{_}A person born deaf and dumb cannot make a will, unless there is evidence that he could read and comprehend its contents.
10136-8{_}31523{_}A person convicted of felony cannot make a will, unless subsequently pardoned; neither can persons outlawed; but the wife of a felon transported for life may make a will, and act in all respects as if she were unmarried.
10136-8{_}31524{_}A suicide may bequeath real estate, but personal property is forfeited to the crown.
10136-8{_}31525{_}2734.
10136-8{_}31526{_}Except in the case of soldiers on actual service, and sailors at sea, every will must be made in writing.
10136-8{_}31527{_}It must be signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence, and at his request, and the signature must be made or acknowledged in the presence of two or more witnesses, who are required to be present at the same time, who declare by signing that the will was signed by the testator, or acknowledged in their presence, and that they signed as witnesses in testator's presence.
10136-8{_}31528{_}2735.
10136-8{_}31529{_}By the act of 1852 it was enacted that no will shall be valid unless signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some person in his presence, and by his direction; but a subsequent act proceeds to say that every will shall, as far only as regards the position of the signature of the testator, or of the person signing for him, be deemed valid if the signature shall be so placed at, or after, or following, or under, or beside, or opposite to the end of the will, that it shall be apparent on the face of it that the testator intended to give it effect by such signature.
10136-8{_}31530{_}Under this clause, a will of several sheets, all of which were duly signed, except the last one, has been refused probate; while, on the other hand, a similar document has been admitted to probate where the last sheet only, and none of the other sheets, was signed.
10136-8{_}31531{_}In order to be perfectly formal, however, each separate sheet should be numbered, signed, and witnessed, and attested on the last sheet.
10136-8{_}31532{_}This witnessing is an important act: the witnesses must subscribe it in the presence of the testator and of each other; and by their signature they testify to having witnessed the signature of the testator, he being in sound mind at the time.
10136-8{_}31533{_}Wills made under any kind of coercion, or even importunity may become void, being contrary to the wishes of the testator.
10136-8{_}31534{_}Fraud or imposition also renders a will void, and where two wills made by the same person happen to exist, neither of them dated, the maker of the wills is declared to have died intestate.
10136-8{_}31535{_}2736.
10136-8{_}31536{_}A will may always be revoked and annulled, but only by burning or entirely destroying the writing, or by adding a codicil, or making a subsequent will duly attested; but as the alteration of a will is only a revocation to the extent of the alteration, if it is intended to revoke the original will entirely, such intention should be declared,--no merely verbal directions can revoke a written will; and the act of running the pen through the signatures, or down the page, is not sufficient to cancel it, without a written declaration to that effect signed and witnessed.
10136-8{_}31537{_}2737.
10136-8{_}31538{_}A will made before marriage is revoked thereby.
10136-8{_}31539{_}2738.
10136-8{_}31540{_}A codicil is a supplement or addition to a will, either explaining or altering former dispositions; it may be written on the same or separate paper, and is to be witnessed and attested in the same manner as the original document.
10136-8{_}31541{_}2739.
10136-8{_}31542{_}WITNESSES.--Any persons are qualified to witness a will who can write their names; but such witness cannot be benefitted by the will.
10136-8{_}31543{_}If a legacy is granted to the persons witnessing, it is void.
10136-8{_}31544{_}The same rule applies to the husband or wife of a witness; a bequest made to either of these is void.
10136-8{_}31545{_}2740.
10136-8{_}31546{_}FORM OF WILLS.--Form is unimportant, provided the testator's intention is clear.
10136-8{_}31547{_}It should commence with his designation; that is, his name and surname, place of abode, profession, or occupation.
10136-8{_}31548{_}The legatees should also be clearly described.
10136-8{_}31549{_}In leaving a legacy to a married woman, if no trustees are appointed over it, and no specific directions given, "that it is for her sole and separate use, free from the control, debts, and incumbrances of her husband," the husband will be entitled to the legacy.
10136-8{_}31550{_}In the same manner a legacy to an unmarried woman will vest in her husband after marriage, unless a settlement of it is made on her before marriage.
10136-8{_}31551{_}2741.
10136-8{_}31552{_}In sudden emergencies a form may be useful, and the following has been considered a good one for a death-bed will, where the assistance of a solicitor could not be obtained; indeed, few solicitors can prepare a will on the spur of the moment: they require time and legal forms, which are by no means necessary, before they can act.
10136-8{_}31553{_}I, A.B., of No.
10136-8{_}31554{_}10, ----, Street, in the city of ----     [gentleman, builder, or grocer, as the case may be,] being of     sound mind, thus publish and declare my last will and testament.
10136-8{_}31555{_}Revoking and annulling all former dispositions of my property, I     give and bequeath as follows:--to my son J.B., of ----, I give     and bequeath the sum of ---; to my daughter M., the wife of J.,     of ----, I give and bequeath the sum of ---- [if intended for     her own use, add "to her sole and separate use, free from the     control, debts, and incumbrances of her husband"], both in     addition to any sum or sums of money or other property they have     before had from me.
10136-8{_}31556{_}All the remaining property I die possessed     of I leave to my dear wife M. B., for her sole and separate use     during her natural life, together with my house and furniture,     situate at No.
10136-8{_}31557{_}10, ---- Street, aforesaid.
10136-8{_}31558{_}At her death, I     desire that the said house shall be sold, with all the goods and     chattels therein [or, I give and bequeath the said house, with     all the goods and chattels therein, to ----], and the money     realized from the sale, together with that in which my said wife     had a life-interest, I give and bequeath in equal moieties to my     son and daughter before named.
10136-8{_}31559{_}I appoint my dear friend T.S., of     ----, and T.B., of ----, together with my wife M.B., as     executors to this my last will and testament.
10136-8{_}31560{_}Signed by A.B., this 10th day of October, 1861, in our presence,     both being present together, and both having signed as     witnesses, in the presence of the testator:--A.B.
10136-8{_}31561{_}T.S., Witness.
10136-8{_}31562{_}F.M., Witness.
10136-8{_}31563{_}It is to be observed that the signature of the testator after this attestation has been signed by the witnesses, is not a compliance with the act; he must sign first.
10136-8{_}31564{_}2742.
10136-8{_}31565{_}STAMP-DUTIES.--In the case of persons dying intestate, when their effects are administered to by their family, the stamp-duty is half as much more as it would have been under a will.
10136-8{_}31566{_}Freehold and copyhold estates are now subject to a special impost on passing, by the Stamp Act of 1857.
10136-8{_}31567{_}2743.
10136-8{_}31568{_}The legacy-duty only commences when it amounts to £20 and upwards; and where it is not directed otherwise, the duty is deducted from the legacy.
10136-8{_}31569{_}2744.
10136-8{_}31570{_}You cannot compound for past absence of charity by bequeathing land or tenements, or money to purchase such, to any charitable use, by your last will and testament; but you may devise them to the British Museum, to either of the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge, to Eton, Winchester, and Westminster; and you may, if so inclined, leave it for the augmentation of Queen Anne's bounty.
10136-8{_}31571{_}You may, however, order your executors to sell land and hand over the money received to any charitable institution.
10136-8{_}31572{_}2745.
10136-8{_}31573{_}In making provision for a wife, state whether it is in lieu of, or in addition to, dower.
10136-8{_}31574{_}2746.
10136-8{_}31575{_}If you have advanced money to any child, and taken an acknowledgment for it, or entered it in any book of account, you should declare whether any legacy left by will is in addition to such advance, or whether it is to be deducted from the legacy.
10136-8{_}31576{_}2747.
10136-8{_}31577{_}A legacy left by will to any one would be cancelled by your leaving another legacy by a codicil to the same person, unless it is stated to be in addition to the former bequest.
10136-8{_}31578{_}2748.
10136-8{_}31579{_}Your entire estate is chargeable with your debts, except where the real estate is settled.
10136-8{_}31580{_}Let it be distinctly stated out of which property, the real or personal, they are paid, where it consists of both.
10136-8{_}31581{_}2749.
10136-8{_}31582{_}Whatever is _devised_, let the intention be clearly expressed, and without any condition, if you intend it to take effect.
10136-8{_}31583{_}2750.
10136-8{_}31584{_}Attestation is not necessary to a will, as the act of witnessing is all the law requires, and the will itself declares the testator to be of sound mind in his own estimation; but, wherever there are erasures or interlineations, one becomes necessary.
10136-8{_}31585{_}No particular form is prescribed; but it should state that the testator either signed it himself, or that another signed it by his request, or that he acknowledged the signature to be his in their presence, both being present together, and signed as witnesses in his presence.
10136-8{_}31586{_}When there are erasures, the attestation must declare that--The words interlined in the third line of page 4, and the erasure in the fifth line of page 6, having been first made.
10136-8{_}31587{_}These are the acts necessary to make a properly executed will; and, being simple in themselves and easily performed, they should be strictly complied with, and always attested.
10136-8{_}31588{_}2751.
10136-8{_}31589{_}A witness may, on being requested, sign for testator; and he may also sign for his fellow-witness, supposing he can only make his mark, declaring that he does so; but a husband cannot sign for his wife, either as testator or witness, nor can a wife for her husband.

10136-8{_}31679{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10136-8{_}31680{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10136-8{_}31690{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10136-8{_}31691{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10136-8{_}31692{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10136-8{_}31693{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
10136-8{_}31694{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.

10136-8{_}31696{_}International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
10136-8{_}31697{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
10136-8{_}31698{_}Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
10136-8{_}31699{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10136-8{_}31701{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10136-8{_}31702{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10136-8{_}31703{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10136-8{_}31704{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10136-8{_}31705{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10136-8{_}31706{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10136-8{_}31707{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10136-8{_}31708{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10136-8{_}31709{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10136-8{_}31710{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:  http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10136-8{_}31711{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10136-8{_}31712{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10136-8{_}31713{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10136-8{_}31714{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10136-8{_}31715{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10136-8{_}31716{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10136-8{_}31717{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:  http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks: http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL  *** END: FULL LICENSE ***
