12378-8{_}9{_}[Illustration]  "WHY NOT LIVE OUT OF LONDON?"
12378-8{_}10{_}SIR,--Capital subject recently started _Daily Telegraph_, with     the above title.
12378-8{_}11{_}Just what I've been saying to my wife for     years past.
12378-8{_}12{_}"Why don't _you and the family_ live out of     London," I have asked.
12378-8{_}13{_}And she has invariably replied, "Oh,     yes, and what would _you_ be doing in London?"
12378-8{_}14{_}I impress upon     her that being the "bread-winner" (beautiful word, this!)
12378-8{_}15{_}my     duty is to be on the spot where the bread is won.
12378-8{_}16{_}I prove     to her, in figures, that it is much cheaper for her and the     family to live out of town, and for me to come down and     see them, occasionally.
12378-8{_}17{_}Isn't it cheaper for one to go to a     theatre than four?
12378-8{_}18{_}Well, this applies everywhere all round.
12378-8{_}19{_}With my Club and a good room I could get on very well and very     reasonably in London, and in the country my wife and family     _would positively save enormously_ by my absence, _as only the     necessaries of life would be required_.
12378-8{_}20{_}Dressing would be next     to nothing, so to speak, and they'd be out of reach of the     temptations which London offers to those who love theatre     entertainments, lunches at pastrycooks', shows, and shopping.
12378-8{_}21{_}Yes, emphatically, I repeat, "Why not live out of London?"
12378-8{_}22{_}_But she won't._      Yours,      ONE IN A THOUSAND.
12378-8{_}23{_}SIR,--"Why not live out of London?"
12378-8{_}24{_}Of course.
12378-8{_}25{_}I _do_ live     "out of London," and make a precious good living too out of     London.
12378-8{_}26{_}My friends the Butcher, the Baker, the Greengrocer     (not a very green grocer either), the Tailor, the Shoemaker,     &c., &c., all say the same as      Yours cheerily,      CHARLES CHEDDAR _(Cheesemonger)._       SIR,--I only wish everybody I don't want to see _in_ London     would live _out of it_.
12378-8{_}27{_}What a thrice blessed time August     would be then!
12378-8{_}28{_}Though indeed I infinitely appreciate small     mercies _now_.
12378-8{_}29{_}At all events, most people are away, my Club is     not closed, and I can enjoy myself pretty thoroughly.
12378-8{_}30{_}Yours,      _Elbow Room Club_.
12378-8{_}31{_}BEAU WINDER.
12378-8{_}32{_}SIR,--"Why not live out of London?"
12378-8{_}33{_}_Because one can't._ Out     of London there is only "existence."
12378-8{_}34{_}Is life worth living     anywhere except in London--and Paris; if you happen to be     there?
12378-8{_}35{_}No, no; those who like living "out of London," had     better not live at all.
12378-8{_}36{_}Yours,      HIPPY CURE.

12378-8{_}53{_}DEAR CHARLIE,--No Parry for me, mate, not this season leastways--wus                    luck!
12378-8{_}54{_}At the shop I'm employed in at present, the hands has all bloomin'                    well struck.
12378-8{_}55{_}It's hupset all our 'olidays, CHARLIE, and as to my chance of a                    rise   Wot do _you_ think, old pal?
12378-8{_}56{_}I'm fair flummoxed, and singing, _Oh,                    what a surprise!_    These Strikes is becoming rare noosances, dashed if they ain't,                    dear old boy.
12378-8{_}57{_}They're all over the shop, like Miss ZÃ†O, wot street-kids seems so                    to enjoy.
12378-8{_}58{_}Mugs' game!
12378-8{_}59{_}They'll soon find as the Marsters ain't goin' to be                    worried and welched,   And when they rob coves of their 'olidays, 'ang it, they ought to                    be squelched.
12378-8{_}60{_}'Owsomever, I'm mucked, that's a moral.
12378-8{_}61{_}This doosid dead-set                    against Wealth   Is a sign o' the times as looks orkud, and bad for the national                    'ealth.
12378-8{_}62{_}There ain't nothink the nobs is fair nuts on but wot these 'ere                    bellerers ban.
12378-8{_}63{_}Wy, they're down upon Sport, now, a pelter.
12378-8{_}64{_}Perposterous, ain't it,                    old man?
12378-8{_}65{_}Bin a reading FRED 'ARRISON'S kibosh along o' "The Feast of                    St. Grouse,"   On the "Glorious Twelfth," as he calls it; wen swells is fair shut                    of the 'Ouse,   Its Obstruction, and similar 'orrors, in course they hikes off to                    the Moors.
12378-8{_}66{_}Small blame to 'em, CHARLIE, small blame to 'em, spite of the prigs                    and the boors!
12378-8{_}67{_}Yet this 'ARRISON he sets _his_ back up.
12378-8{_}68{_}Dry smug as can't 'andle                    a gun,   I'll bet Marlboro' 'Ouse to a broomstick, and ain't got no notion                    of Fun.
12378-8{_}69{_}"Loves the Moors much too well for to carry one;" that's wot _he_                    says, sour old sap   Bet my boots as he can't 'it a 'aystack at twenty yards rise--eh,                    old chap?
12378-8{_}70{_}_Him_ sweet on the heather, my pippin, or partial to feather                    and fur,   So long as yer never _kills_ nothink?
12378-8{_}71{_}Sech tommy-rot gives me                    the spur.
12378-8{_}72{_}Yah!
12378-8{_}73{_}Scenery's all very proper, but where is the genuine pot   Who'd pad the 'oof over the Moors, if it weren't for the things                    to be shot?
12378-8{_}74{_}"This swagger about killing birds is mere cant," sez this wobbling                    old wag.
12378-8{_}75{_}From Arran he'd tramp to Dunrobin without the least chance of a bag!
12378-8{_}76{_}"Peaceful hills," that's his patter, my pippin; no gillies, no                    luncheons, no game!
12378-8{_}77{_}Wy, he ought to be tossed in a blanket; it fills a true Briton                    with shame.
12378-8{_}78{_}No Moors for yours truly, wus luck!
12378-8{_}79{_}It won't run to it, CHARLIE,                    this round;   But give me my gun, and a chance, and I'll be in the swim, I'll                    be bound.
12378-8{_}80{_}I did 'ave a turn some years back, though I only went out with                    'em once,   And I shot a bit wild, as was likely, fust off, though yer _may_n't                    be a dunce.
12378-8{_}81{_}My rig out was a picter they told me--deer-stalker and knickers                    O.K.--   "BRIGGS, Junior," a lobsculler called me; I wasn't quite fly to                    his lay;   But BRIGGS or no BRIGGS I shaped spiffin, in mustard-and-mud-colour                    checks.
12378-8{_}82{_}Ah!
12378-8{_}83{_}them Moors is the spots for cold Irish, and gives yer the                    primest of pecks.
12378-8{_}84{_}Talk of sandwiges, CHARLIE, oh scissors, I'd soon ha' cleaned out                    Charing Cross,   With St. Pancrust and Ludgit chucked in; fairly hopened the eye of                    the boss;   Him as rented the shootings, yer know, big dry-salter in Thames                    Street, bit warm   In his langwige occasional, CHARLIE, but 'arty and reglar good form.
12378-8{_}85{_}Swells will pal in most anywhere now on the chance of a gratis                    Big Shoot,   And there _wos_ some Swells with hus, I tell yer, I felt on the                    good gay galoot,   But I fancy I got jest a morsel screwdnoodleous late in the day,   For I peppered a bloke in the breeks; he swore bad, but 'twas                    only his play.
12378-8{_}86{_}Bagged a brace and a arf, I did, CHARLIE; not bad for a novice                    like me.
12378-8{_}87{_}Jest a bit blown about the fust two; wanted gathering up like,                    yer see.
12378-8{_}88{_}A bird do look best with his 'ed on, dear boy, as a matter of taste;   And the gillies got jest a mite scoffy along of my natural 'aste.
12378-8{_}89{_}Never arsked me no more, for some reason.
12378-8{_}90{_}But wot I would say is                    this here,   'ARRY's bin in this boat in his time, as in every prime lark pooty                    near,   And when 'ARRISON talks blooming bunkum, with hadjectives spicy and                    strong,   About Sport being stupid, and noisy, and vulgar; wy, 'ARRISON'S wrong!
12378-8{_}91{_}_He_ would rather shoot broken-down cab-horses,--so the mug tells                    us--than birds.
12378-8{_}92{_}Well, they're more in his line very likely; that means, in his own                    chosen words,   He's more fit for a hammytoor knacker than for that great boast of                    our land,   A true British Sportsman!
12378-8{_}93{_}Great Scott!
12378-8{_}94{_}It's a taste as I _carnt_                    understand.
12378-8{_}95{_}Fact is this here FRED is a Demmycrat, Positivist, and all that.
12378-8{_}96{_}There's the nick o' the matter, the reason of all this un-English                    wild chat.
12378-8{_}97{_}He is down on the Aristos, CHARLIE, this 'ARRISON is.
12378-8{_}98{_}It's the Court   And the pick o' the Peerage Sport nobbles, and that's wy he sputters                    at Sport.
12378-8{_}99{_}All a part of the game, dear old pal, the dead-set at the noble and                    rich.
12378-8{_}100{_}"Smart people" are "Sports," mostly always, and 'ARRISON slates                    them as sich.
12378-8{_}101{_}'Ates killing of "beautiful creatures," and spiling "the Tummel                    in spate"   With "drives," champagne luncheons, and gillies?
12378-8{_}102{_}_That_'s not wot                    sich slab-dabbers 'ate.
12378-8{_}103{_}It's "Privileged Classes," my pippin, they loathes.
12378-8{_}104{_}Yer can't own a                    big Moor,   Or even rent one like my dry-salter friend, if yer 'umble and poor.
12378-8{_}105{_}Don't 'ARRISON never _eat_ grouse?
12378-8{_}106{_}Ah, you bet, much as ever he'll                    carry.
12378-8{_}107{_}There's "poz" for a Posit'vist, mate, there's 'ARRISON kiboshed                    by 'ARRY.

12378-8{_}110{_}Oh dear!
12378-8{_}111{_}oh dear!
12378-8{_}112{_}What perils I have been through!
12378-8{_}113{_}You'll see me again shortly; but there have been _momentums_ in my career when I said to myself, "Shall I ever _aller_ out of this alive!"
12378-8{_}114{_}I escaped the Petersburg police; they punched out your Cartoon, and all the lines about the Czar and the Jews; that's why I was so persecuted, and why I was watched.
12378-8{_}115{_}I wish to Heaven you wouldn't have Cartoons about Czars and Jews just when I'm at Peterborough, I mean Petersburg; same name, different place.
12378-8{_}116{_}But there, that's all over now, and _jamais_ will I go and put myself within the clutches of the Russian Bear again.
12378-8{_}117{_}The midnight sun must do without _me_ in future.
12378-8{_}118{_}I send you a sketch I made of a gargle--I think that's the name--on a church-door in Lapland.
12378-8{_}119{_}Isn't it really droll?
12378-8{_}120{_}You're always bothering me for something droll, and _now you've got it_.
12378-8{_}121{_}Then, _Mr.
12378-8{_}122{_}Punch_, riding a reindeer at half-a-crown an hour.
12378-8{_}123{_}Then here are the little Lapps offering our sailors a lap of liquor; and I said to myself, "One touch of Nature," which struck me as just the very motto for the picture.
12378-8{_}124{_}I roared with laughter at it.
12378-8{_}125{_}"This'll do for 'em at home," I said, and so here it is.
12378-8{_}126{_}And look at the "Lapps of Luxury"!
12378-8{_}127{_}You know that "Lap of Luxury" is a proverbial phrase; and, as you told me to make some comic sketches of the manners and customs of the country, why, I've done so; and, if they ain't funny, I don't know what humour is.
12378-8{_}128{_}_VoilÃ !_  But you really must not expect me to grimace and buffoon.
12378-8{_}129{_}You must take me _seriatim_ or not at all.
12378-8{_}130{_}I can't stand on my head to sketch.
12378-8{_}131{_}I can't do it.
12378-8{_}132{_}I nearly _did_ do it, though, for when I had my sketching-book in my hand on board, the spanker-boom, or some such thing, came over suddenly and hit me such a whack on the head, that for two minutes I lay insensible, and thought I should never become sensible again.
12378-8{_}133{_}Rightly is it called "spanker-boom,"--that is if it _is_ called so, or some name very like it,--for I never got such a whack on the head in all my life before.
12378-8{_}134{_}I hear the Booming still in my ears.
12378-8{_}135{_}You can't expect a fellow to be funny, however funny he may _feel_ (and I _did_ feel uncommonly funny, you may take your oath!
12378-8{_}136{_}), under such circumstances.
12378-8{_}137{_}However, as the song says, "Home once more," and many a yarn shall I have to tell when I gather myself round the fireside, pipe all hands for grog, and sing you an old Norse song with real humour in it--though I dare say _you'll_ say you don't see it--and so no more _Ã  prÃ©sent_ from yours seasickly (I am quite well, but I mean I'm sick of the sea),  FLOTSAM, Y.A.

12378-8{_}139{_}FIFTH ENTRY.
12378-8{_}140{_}Curious thing that to-day--after disappointment of failure for the Bar--letter comes from President of my old College, asking me "if I would accept a nice Tutorship for a time?"
12378-8{_}141{_}If so, "I had better come down and talk to him about it."
12378-8{_}142{_}Decided a little time ago not to try "Scholastic Profession"--thought it would try _me_ too much.
12378-8{_}143{_}Feel tempted now.
12378-8{_}144{_}_Query_--am I losing my old pluck?
12378-8{_}145{_}In consequence of my new "pluck,"--in the Bar Exam?
12378-8{_}146{_}"Um!"
12378-8{_}147{_}remarks the President (I _have_ run down and got a vacant bed-room in College).
12378-8{_}148{_}"Glad to see you.
12378-8{_}149{_}Oh, yes, about that tutorship.
12378-8{_}150{_}Um, um!
12378-8{_}151{_}The family live in Somerset."
12378-8{_}152{_}He mentions the county apologetically, as if he expected me to reply--"Oh, Somerset!
12378-8{_}153{_}Couldn't dream of going _there_.
12378-8{_}154{_}Not very particular, but must have a place within ten miles of Charing Cross."
12378-8{_}155{_}As I don't object to Somerset, at least audibly, he goes on more cheerfully--  "Boy doesn't want to be taught much, so perhaps, it would suit you."
12378-8{_}156{_}--(_Query_--is this insulting?)
12378-8{_}157{_}--"He wants a companion more--somebody to keep him steady, have a good influence and all that, and give him a little classics and so on for about an hour a day."
12378-8{_}158{_}It did not sound as bad as I expected.
12378-8{_}159{_}"Rich people--um--merchants at Bristol, I think.
12378-8{_}160{_}Not very cultivated, though."
12378-8{_}161{_}Here President pauses again, and looks as if he would not be at all astonished if I rose from my chair, put on my hat, and said, "Not very cultivated!
12378-8{_}162{_}That won't suit _me_!
12378-8{_}163{_}You see how tremendously cultivated _I_ am."
12378-8{_}164{_}But I don't, and he proceeds calmly to another head of his discourse.
12378-8{_}165{_}"They haven't mentioned terms, but I'm sure they will be satisfactory--give you what you ask, in fact."
12378-8{_}166{_}(Rather a nice trait in their character, this.)
12378-8{_}167{_}--"Now, will you--um--take it?
12378-8{_}168{_}They want somebody at once."
12378-8{_}169{_}"Yes," I reply; "I'll go and see how I fancy it.
12378-8{_}170{_}Have they got a billiard-table, do you happen to know?"
12378-8{_}171{_}The President says, "he doesn't know anything about _that_," and looks a little surprised, as if I had proposed a game of skittles.
12378-8{_}172{_}On way down (next day) I feel rather like a Governess going to her first situation.
12378-8{_}173{_}Get to house late.
12378-8{_}174{_}Too dark to see what it's like.

12378-8{_}177{_}My reception is peculiar.
12378-8{_}178{_}A stout, masculine-looking female with a strident voice, is presumably Mrs. BRISTOL MERCHANT.
12378-8{_}179{_}Sends me up to my bed-room as if I were my own luggage.
12378-8{_}180{_}Evidently very "uncultivated."
12378-8{_}181{_}In my bed-room.
12378-8{_}182{_}Above are the sounds of a small pandemonium, apparently.
12378-8{_}183{_}Stamping, falling, shouting, bumping, crying.
12378-8{_}184{_}What a lot of them there must be!
12378-8{_}185{_}There are!
12378-8{_}186{_}At supper--they appear to have early dinners, which I detest--three boys and one girl present, as a sample.
12378-8{_}187{_}Eldest a youth about ten, who puts out his tongue at me, when he thinks I'm not looking, and kicks his brothers beneath the table to make them cry, which they do.
12378-8{_}188{_}I begin to wonder when my real pupil will appear.
12378-8{_}189{_}Governess talks to me as if I were a brother professional.
12378-8{_}190{_}_Query--infra dig_.
12378-8{_}191{_}again?
12378-8{_}192{_}Children, being forbidden to talk in anything but French at meals, say nothing at all; at the end I am astounded at Materfamilias catching hold of the boy of ten, and bringing him round to me, with the remark,--  "Perhaps you'd like to talk to ERNIE about lessons."
12378-8{_}193{_}Heavens!
12378-8{_}194{_}This nursery fledgling to be my pupil!
12378-8{_}195{_}And I am to be his "companion"!
12378-8{_}196{_}Fledgling, while standing in front of me for inspection, has the audacity to stretch out his leg, and trip up a little sister who is passing.
12378-8{_}197{_}Howls ensue.
12378-8{_}198{_}A nicely-mannered youth!
12378-8{_}199{_}"You will have to behave yourself with _me_, young man!"
12378-8{_}200{_}I warn him, in a tone which ought to abash him, but doesn't in the least.
12378-8{_}201{_}"Ah, but perhaps you won't stay here long," is his rather able rejoinder.
12378-8{_}202{_}"Our Governesses never--"  "ERNIE!"
12378-8{_}203{_}shrieks his mother, threateningly.
12378-8{_}204{_}ERNIE stops; and I have time to regret my folly in not inquiring of the President the precise age of my promising disciple, very likely President didn't know himself.
12378-8{_}205{_}The other boys who were at supper are now presented to me.
12378-8{_}206{_}One is about eight, the other not more than six.
12378-8{_}207{_}"These are HERBIE and JACK," says their mother, who ought to know.
12378-8{_}208{_}Thank Heaven, _they_ are not my pupils!
12378-8{_}209{_}Mrs. BRISTOL MERCHANT horrifies me by saying--  "I thought it would be so nice, when you were teaching ERNIE, _if_ HERBIE _and_ JACK _could be taught too!_ And after lessons you will be able to take them such nice long walks in the neighbourhood!
12378-8{_}210{_}It's really very pretty country, Mr.--I forget your name."
12378-8{_}211{_}Oh, certainly, the President was quite right.
12378-8{_}212{_}She _is_ very uncultivated.
12378-8{_}213{_}That ever I was born to cultivate her--or her precious offspring!
12378-8{_}214{_}But was I?

12378-8{_}221{_}[The Rev.
12378-8{_}222{_}B. MEREDYTH-KITSON called the attention of the     London School Board to the action of Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS,     who, being appealed to by "a respectable-looking woman" for     the remission of a fine of five shillings imposed upon her     husband for neglecting to send their children to school, gave     her five shillings out of the poor-box to pay it, on finding     that she had nine children, the eldest fifteen years, the     youngest five months, a husband out of work, and "no boots     for her children to go to school in."
12378-8{_}223{_}The Rev.
12378-8{_}224{_}STEWART HEADLAM     said that in East London they suffered a good deal through     the decisions of Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS, who constantly paid the     fines from the poor-box, or out of his own pocket!]
12378-8{_}225{_}Oh, MONTAGU, this conduct is nefarious!
12378-8{_}226{_}_You_ are, indeed, a pretty Magistrate!
12378-8{_}227{_}Better the judgments, generous, if precarious,     Of the old Cadi at an Eastern gate.
12378-8{_}228{_}No wonder that you madden MEREDTTH-KITSON,     And stir the bitter bile of STEWART HEADLAM.
12378-8{_}229{_}When Justice, School-Board ruling simply "sits on,"     School-Boards become a mere annexe of--Bedlam!
12378-8{_}230{_}Nine children!
12378-8{_}231{_}Husband out of work!
12378-8{_}232{_}No boots!
12378-8{_}233{_}And do you really think that _these_ are reasons   For fine-remission?
12378-8{_}234{_}This strikes at the roots     Of Law, which ought to rule us at all seasons.
12378-8{_}235{_}Oh, how shall KITSON educate the "kids,"     Or how shall HEADLAM discipline the mothers,   If you, instead of doing what Law bids,     Pay the poor creatures' fines and raise up bothers?
12378-8{_}236{_}Law, Sir, is Law, even to Magistrates,     Not a mere chopping-block for maudlin charity.
12378-8{_}237{_}Fining the impecunious doubtless grates     On feelings such as yours; there's some disparity   'Twixt School-Board Draconism, and regard     For parents penniless, and children bootless;   But pedagogues--ask HEADLAM--must be hard,     Or pedagogy's purposes are fruitless.
12378-8{_}238{_}Poor creatures?
12378-8{_}239{_}Humph!
12378-8{_}240{_}Compassion's mighty fine;     A gentle feeling, who would wish to shock it?
12378-8{_}241{_}But husbands out of work with children nine,     Should pay their fines themselves--not from _your_ pocket.

12378-8{_}244{_}Belgravia's drawn her blinds, and let her window-boxes run to seed;   Street-urchins play in porticoes--no powdered menial there to heed;   Now fainter grows the lumbering roll of luggage-cumbered omnibus:   Bayswater's children all are off upon their annual exodus.

12378-8{_}251{_}'Twas there, in yonder balcony, that last July she used to stand;   Upon some balcony, more blest, she's leaning now, in Switzerland,    Her eyes upon rose-tinted peaks--but no, of sense I 'm quite bereft!
12378-8{_}252{_}The hour is full early yet, and _table d hÃ´te_ she'll scarce have left.
12378-8{_}253{_}Some happy neighbour's handing her the salad--But I'll move, I think;   I see a grim caretaker's eye regard me through the shutter's chink.
12378-8{_}254{_}Yes, I'll away,--no longer be the sport of sentiment forlorn,   But scale the heights of Primrose Hill, pretending it's the Matterhorn;   Or hie me through the dusk to sit beside the shimmering Serpentine,   And, with a little make-believe, imagine I am up the Rhine.

12378-8{_}262{_}Why, you can go all the way right from here to Mile End Road for threepence!
12378-8{_}263{_}_Second Matron._ What, all that way for threepence--(_with an impulse of vague humanity_.)
12378-8{_}264{_}The _poor_ 'orses!
12378-8{_}265{_}_First Matron._ Ah, well, my dear, it's Competition, you know,--it don't do to think too much of it.

12378-8{_}273{_}_Second Girl._ How _did_ she behave?
12378-8{_}274{_}_[A faint curiosity is discernible amongst the other passengers to learn how she--whoever she is--behaved that Sunday.
12378-8{_}275{_}First Girl._ Why, it was you _told_ me!

12378-8{_}277{_}That night JOE let out about her and the automatic scent fountain.

12378-8{_}282{_}_First Girl,_ That was ELIZA all over.
12378-8{_}283{_}If GEORGE had been sensible, he'd have broken it off then and there--but no, he wouldn't hear a word against her, not at that time--it was the button-hook opened _his_ eyes!

12378-8{_}285{_}And enough too!
12378-8{_}286{_}But what put GEORGE off most was her keeping that bag so quiet.
12378-8{_}287{_}_[The general imagination is once more stirred to its depths by this mysterious allusion._  _First Girl._ Yes, he did feel that, I know, he used to come and go on about it to me by the hour together.
12378-8{_}288{_}"I shouldn't have minded so much," he told me over and over again, with the tears standing in his eyes,--"if it hadn't been that the bottles was all silver-mounted!"
12378-8{_}289{_}_Second Girl._ Silver-mounted?
12378-8{_}290{_}I never heard of _that_ before--no wonder he felt hurt!
12378-8{_}291{_}_First Girl (impressively)._ Silver tops to everyone of them--and that girl to turn round as she did, and her with an Uncle in the oil and colour line, too--it nearly broke GEORGE'S 'art!
12378-8{_}292{_}_Second Girl_.
12378-8{_}293{_}He's such a one to take on about things--but, as I said to him, "GEORGE," I says, "You must remember it might have been worse.
12378-8{_}294{_}Suppose you'd been married to that girl, and _then_ found out about ALF and the Jubilee sixpence--how would _that_ have been?"
12378-8{_}295{_}_First Girl (unconsciously acting as the mouth-piece of the other passengers)._ And what did he say to _that?_  _Second Girl._ Oh, nothing--there was nothing he _could_ say, but I could see he was struck.
12378-8{_}296{_}She behaved very mean to the last--she wouldn't send back the German concertina.
12378-8{_}297{_}_First Girl._ You don't say so!
12378-8{_}298{_}Well, I wouldn't have thought that of her, bad as she is.
12378-8{_}299{_}_Second Girl._ No, she stuck to it that it wasn't like a regular present, being got through a grocer, and as she couldn't send him back the tea, being drunk,--but did you hear how she treated EMMA over the crinoline 'at she got for her?
12378-8{_}300{_}_First Girl (to the immense relief of the rest)._ No, what was that?
12378-8{_}301{_}_Second Girl._ Well, I had it from EMMA her own self.
12378-8{_}302{_}ELIZA wrote up to her and says, in a postscript like,--Why, this is Tottenham Court Road, I get out here.
12378-8{_}303{_}Good-bye, dear, I must tell you the rest another day.
12378-8{_}304{_}_[Gets out, leaving the tantalised audience inconsolable, and longing for courage to question her companion as to the precise details of_ ELIZA'S _heartless behaviour to_ GEORGE.
12378-8{_}305{_}_The companion, however, relapses into a stony reserve.
12378-8{_}306{_}Enter a_ Chatty Old Gentleman _who has no secrets from anybody, and of course selects as the first recipient of his confidence the one person who hates to be talked to in an omnibus._  _The Chatty O.G._ I've just been having a talk with the policeman at the corner there--what do you think I said to him?
12378-8{_}307{_}_His Opposite Neighbour._ I--I really don't know.
12378-8{_}308{_}_The C.O.G._ Well, I told him he was a rich man compared to me.
12378-8{_}309{_}He said, "I only get thirty shillings a week, Sir."
12378-8{_}310{_}"Ah," I said, "but look at your expenses, compared to mine.
12378-8{_}311{_}What would _you_ do if you had to spend eight hundred a year on your children's education?

12378-8{_}314{_}N. (utterly uninterested)._ Do you indeed?--dear me!
12378-8{_}315{_}_C.O.G._ Not that I grudge it--a good education is a fortune in itself, and as I've always told my boys, they must make the best of it, for it's all they'll get.
12378-8{_}316{_}They're good enough lads, but I've had a deal of trouble with them one way and another--a _deal_ of trouble.

12378-8{_}323{_}Don't you take any notice," I told him--_(this to a callow young man, who blushes)_--"they're a Couple of young fools," I said, "but you tell your dear wife from me not to mind those boys of mine--they'll soon get tired of it if they're only let alone."
12378-8{_}324{_}And so they would have, long ago, it's my belief, if they'd met with no encouragement--but what can _I_ do--it's a heavy trial to a father, you know.
12378-8{_}325{_}Then there's my third son--he must needs go and marry--_(to a Lady at his side with a reticule, who gasps faintly)_--some young woman who dances at a Music-hall--nice daughter-in-law that for a man in my position, eh?
12378-8{_}326{_}I've forbidden him the house of course, and told his mother not to have any communication with him--but I know, Sir,--_(violently, to a Man on his other side, who coughs in much embarrassment)_--I _know_ she meets him once a week under the eagle in Orme Square, and _I_ can't stop her!
12378-8{_}327{_}Then I'm worried about my daughters--one of 'em gave me no peace till I let her have some painting lessons--of course, I naturally thought the drawing-master would be an elderly man--whereas, as things turned out,--  _A Quiet Man in a Corner._ I 'ope you told all this to the Policeman, Sir?

12378-8{_}351{_}Nothing but an overwhelming sense of what is due to myself, to my readers, and to my country, would have dragged me from the Metropolis at this season of the year.
12378-8{_}352{_}But a distinction was offered to me, a distinction so unique and so dazzling that I felt that it would not be fair to my fellow countrymen, of all ages, and of every party, if I failed to take advantage of it, and thus to present to the envious world the proud spectacle of an Englishman honoured by the great French nation.
12378-8{_}353{_}I will narrate the matter as briefly as is consistent with my respect for accuracy, and with my contempt for the tapioca-brained nincompoops who snarl, and chatter, and cackle at me in the organ of Mr. J.

12378-8{_}359{_}In the course of the following day I reached Blancheville.
12378-8{_}360{_}The people, in their holiday attire, were gathered in thousands at the railway station.
12378-8{_}361{_}M. CARAMEL, accompanied by the _PrÃ©fet_ and the _Sous-PrÃ©fet,_ all in their tricolor sashes, was the first to greet me.
12378-8{_}362{_}Saluting me on both cheeks, he called upon the world to witness that this was indeed a great day for Blancheville.
12378-8{_}363{_}My escort, under the command of General Count CROUTAUPOT, then formed up.
12378-8{_}364{_}I mounted the gilded Car of Victory, specially provided for the celebration, and, amidst the plaudits of the assembled millions, I was drawn by a specially-selected band of _Enfants de la Patrie_ (a sort of body-guard, composed entirely of the French aristocracy) to the palace, which had been prepared for my reception.
12378-8{_}365{_}At the banquet, in the Town Hall, the healths of the QUEEN and of M. CARNOT were followed by a lengthy speech, in English, from my brother CARAMEL (we have sworn fraternity), in which he declared that the centuries looked down and redazed in this joice, and that it was a delight for him to carry a toast to the illustrious visitor who had deigned to come to Blancheville.
12378-8{_}366{_}On the following day the ceremony took place.
12378-8{_}367{_}I transcribe and translate from _Le Petit Colporteur de Blancheville_, the chief local journal, an account of what took place.

12378-8{_}369{_}We have made him _Rosier en perpÃ©tuitÃ© de Blancheville_, him the proudest and most sympathetic writer who has dazzled Europe since the great and illustrious PLUMEAU" (a local author of repute) "departed from us.
12378-8{_}370{_}The history of this day must be written.
12378-8{_}371{_}Let us essay to do it as it should be done.
12378-8{_}372{_}In the early morning twelve selected maidens, robed in muslin and lilies, sang the _Tocsin de la Patrie_ outside the Palace where our guest reposed.
12378-8{_}373{_}Soon afterwards he himself appeared in flowing white garments, and showered blessings upon their heads.
12378-8{_}374{_}He descended.
12378-8{_}375{_}He entered the four-in-hand-teams which the _Maire_ had, as a compliment to England, made up with a _char-Ã -banc_ of the neighbourhood.
12378-8{_}376{_}Thus he was drawn to the Market Place, where some of our bravest veterans fired in his honour a thundering salute.
12378-8{_}377{_}The beautiful and admirable Madame CARAMEL then advanced to him with a wreath of roses in her hand.
12378-8{_}378{_}She crowned him with it, saying, 'Wear this for Blancheville.
12378-8{_}379{_}Nobly hast thou earned it.'
12378-8{_}380{_}With difficulty the illustrious author preserved his calm.
12378-8{_}381{_}A tear sparkled in his eye.
12378-8{_}382{_}He bent low, and in a voice choked with emotion, thanked the citizens of our town.
12378-8{_}383{_}Then mounting on a milk-white steed, and surrounded by the young men of the district, he received from the _PrÃ©fet_ the Prix Montyon for virtue."
12378-8{_}384{_}The rest is too flattering.
12378-8{_}385{_}I am hastening home.
12378-8{_}386{_}The QUEEN has been graciously pleased to permit me to wear the Prix Montyon at Court.
12378-8{_}387{_}Can a man want more?
12378-8{_}388{_}Yours, in all humility,  LE ROSIER DE BLANCHEVILLE.

12378-8{_}390{_}_(A piece of extravagance faintly suggestive of a Scene from "The Critic.
12378-8{_}391{_}")_  Lord GEORGE PUFF _and_ Sir JOHN BULL _discovered attending a rehearsal of the Naval Estimates._  _Lord George._ And now I pray your particular attention, Sir JOHN, as this is the best thing in my play--it is a spectacular effect called the Summer Manoeuvres.
12378-8{_}392{_}_Sir John._ And no doubt costly, Lord GEORGE?
12378-8{_}393{_}_Lord George._ You are right, Sir JOHN, as you will have an opportunity of finding out--hereafter.
12378-8{_}394{_}But to the argument.
12378-8{_}395{_}It is supposed that the British Fleet is at war with, indeed, the British Fleet.
12378-8{_}396{_}_Sir John._ A very clever idea.
12378-8{_}397{_}_Lord George._ I flatter myself it is, and novel too.
12378-8{_}398{_}It is true that occasionally the ships comprising the British Fleet have run into one another in the past just as if they had been at war, but then they were avowedly at peace, and now they are undoubtedly the reverse.
12378-8{_}399{_}Do you take my meaning?
12378-8{_}400{_}_Sir John._ Well, not clearly.
12378-8{_}401{_}How do you show that the British Fleet is at war with the British Fleet?
12378-8{_}402{_}_Lord George._ Ah, there comes in my art, and I think you will confess I have a very pretty wit.
12378-8{_}403{_}You see I divide the British Fleet into two parts--one part represents the enemy and the other part represents itself like the House of Commons, a most representative body.
12378-8{_}404{_}That is clear, I hope?
12378-8{_}405{_}_Sir John._ Certainly--one is the British Fleet, and the other is not the British Fleet.
12378-8{_}406{_}But is there no bond of union?
12378-8{_}407{_}_Lord George._ Most assuredly there is--you pay for both.
12378-8{_}408{_}But, pardon me, I beg you will not further interrupt me.
12378-8{_}409{_}So, now that we have the two Fleets face to face, or, I should say, bow to starn, we proceed exactly as if there were a real quarrel between them.
12378-8{_}410{_}We spend money on coal, we spend money on pay, we spend money on ammunition.
12378-8{_}411{_}Nay, by my life, we spend money on everything--just as we should do if war were really declared!
12378-8{_}412{_}That's simple enough.
12378-8{_}413{_}_Sir John._ I confess your plan _does_ seem simple.
12378-8{_}414{_}_Lord George._ And there is more behind.
12378-8{_}415{_}We are not satisfied with merely spending money--we learn a lesson as well.
12378-8{_}416{_}Come, you must confess _that_ surprises you?
12378-8{_}417{_}_Sir John._ Well, I admit that generally, where there is any spending of money, it is _I_ who learn the lesson.
12378-8{_}418{_}_Lord George._ Good--distinctly good!
12378-8{_}419{_}But let us be serious.
12378-8{_}420{_}Well, when we are carrying on a war by every means in our power, we fancy that one Fleet is chasing the other.
12378-8{_}421{_}They both have equal speed, and we give one Fleet twenty-four hours' start of the other, and will you believe me that, although the first follows the second as fast as may be from the beginning to the end of the manoeuvring, they never see one another!
12378-8{_}422{_}On my life--never!
12378-8{_}423{_}They never see the British Fleet, because it's not in sight!
12378-8{_}424{_}_Sir John_.
12378-8{_}425{_}But could you not have learned all this without so great an expenditure of money?
12378-8{_}426{_}_Lord George._ Well, no, Sir JOHN--not at the Admiralty!
12378-8{_}427{_}_Sir John._ And how do you end the farce?
12378-8{_}428{_}_Lord George._ In the usual fashion, Sir JOHN _(ignites blue fire)_--in smoke!

12378-8{_}443{_}Vain holiday nepenthe, sport's unbending,     The Statesman's burdened brain may not forget.

12378-8{_}445{_}The gun, the golf-club, and the rod avail not     In his tired heart to make full holiday;   E'en amidst pastime he must watch, and fail not,     Approaching ills, the shadows on the way.

12378-8{_}576{_}I spent a werry plessant arternoon there, and drove home in style on the Box Seat of a reel Company's Bus.
12378-8{_}577{_}The nex day I went to Higate Wood, another of the grate works of the good old Copperashun.
12378-8{_}578{_}And lawks, what a difference!
12378-8{_}579{_}No swarms of children a playing about on the grass, but lots and lots on 'em a racing about among the hundreds of trees, and their warious fathers and mothers a looking on with smiling faces and prowd looks.
12378-8{_}580{_}There is one place in the werry middle of the Wood where no less than sewen parths meets, and there the Copperashun Committee has bilt up a bewtifool Founting, and a long hinskripshun in praise of Water, tho I shood dout if they speaks from werry much pussonal xperience.
12378-8{_}581{_}I was told as how, when they fust hopened the Founting, the Chairman made a bewtifool speech, and ended by saying, "Water, brite Water for me, and Wine for the trembling Debborshee," and then they all went off to a jolly good dinner.
12378-8{_}582{_}With that artistick taste as so distinguishes 'em, they have crissened the place where the seven roads meets, "The Seven Dials."
12378-8{_}583{_}There was crowds of peeple there, all enjoying of themselves in a nice quiet way, and altogether it was a werry werry nice site.
12378-8{_}584{_}The werry next day I started in the warm sunshine for pretty West Ham Park, and had a leetle adwenture as ushal, for jest as I got there who shoud I meet but the rayther sillybrated Parson of the Parish--tho' judgin by aperiences I shoud have took him for the Bishop of ESSEX--and seeing me in my new Hat and my best black Coat, he werry naterally took me for a inquiring Wisitor, and told me all about the good deed of the Copperashun in saving the Park for the good of the Peeple.
12378-8{_}585{_}There was some werry little chaps a playing Cricket as before despite of the Law, and they had a reel bat too, and one on 'em, seeing me a looking on apruvingly, gave the ball such a tremenjus blow that he got a tooer, so I called out braywo!
12378-8{_}586{_}There seemed a lot of washing going on jest outside the Park, the white shirts and settera, flustering gaily in the breeze.
12378-8{_}587{_}But, as the Poet says, "they're allus Washing somewheres in the World!"
12378-8{_}588{_}The common peeple was orderd to walk on the footpaths, but a gardiner told me as them orders was not ment for such as me.
12378-8{_}589{_}I had a most copious Lunch for tuppense in the helegant Pawillion, and being in a jowial and ginerus mood, I treated six of the jewwenile natives to a simmeler Bankwet.
12378-8{_}590{_}Then there is the sillibrated Band as the Copperashun perwides twice a week, on which occasions reserwed seats is charged a penny each.
12378-8{_}591{_}The werry adwanced state of the musical taste of the nayberhood may be judged by the fact, that at a Concert close by, a "Ode to a Butterfly" was to be played on a base Trombone!
12378-8{_}592{_}The Gardiner told me as there was such a crowd of children on larst Bank Hollerday that there was hardly room to move about, tho' the Park is 80 hakers big; but as I am told that such a space wood hold about 80 thousand, quite cumferal, I thinks as he must have slitely xadgerated.

12378-8{_}603{_}AT THE SEA-SIDE.
12378-8{_}604{_}[Illustration]  DEAR MR. PUNCH,--When I last wrote to you I was anticipatorily revelling in the sea-bathing, tennis tournaments, pier band, and evening promenades of Flatsands.
12378-8{_}605{_}Alas!
12378-8{_}606{_}that I must confess it, but, after a fortnight's visit to that "salubrious spot" (_vide_ highly-coloured advertisements), I give it as my opinion that Flatsands is a failure; and I think that, when you have listened to, or rather perused, my tale of woe, you will agree with me that it is a place to be avoided at all costs.
12378-8{_}607{_}On the difficulties and length of my journey thither (I changed five times, and spent nine hours in doing so), I will not dwell, neither will I lay stress on the fact that, when I did at last reach my destination, a prospect void of either Aunt, or conveyance of any kind, met my view, or that a heavy sea-mist had gathered, and was falling in the guise of penetrating, if fine, rain.
12378-8{_}608{_}After parleying with the station-master for some time, I ascertained that the station 'bus never put in an appearance in wet weather, and that I could not get a closed fly, because the Flatsands' conveyances were all pony-traps, and therefore hoodless.
12378-8{_}609{_}He, however, directed me towards Balmoral, which was my Aunt's address, and told me that ten minutes' walk would take me, and that my luggage should be sent after me, on a truck.
12378-8{_}610{_}After some difficulty, for the sea-fog was very thick, I discovered Balmoral, but not my Aunt.
12378-8{_}611{_}The truculent-looking proprietor of the house, who answered the door, condescended to inform me that my relative "was the difficultest lady he'd ever had to do for.
12378-8{_}612{_}And that she'd left two days a-gone."
12378-8{_}613{_}But where she had betaken herself to, he either would not or could not tell me.
12378-8{_}614{_}"You'd best try along this row," he said, and then slammed the door in my face.
12378-8{_}615{_}Having nothing better to do, I followed his advice, and "tried along the row."
12378-8{_}616{_}I rang at Osborne, Sandringham, and Windsor.
12378-8{_}617{_}I knocked at Claremont (the bell was broken there), and walked boldly into Marlborough House, for that royal residence in particular was devoid of all ordinary means of heralding one's approach.
12378-8{_}618{_}I was just giving up my quest in despair, when through the rain, which was now falling heavily, I spied a small stucco villa standing shrinkingly back behind a row of palings, which, in spite of their green paint, looked more like domestic fire-sticks than anything else.
12378-8{_}619{_}The somewhat suggestive name of Frogmore was inscribed on the small gate, and I remembered that I quite shivered as I walked up the sloppy path, with my usual inquiry ready to hand.
12378-8{_}620{_}This time, though, I was right, and when, a few minutes later, I was sitting before a roaring fire, imbibing hot tea, and listening to my Aunt's account of her latest complaint (did I tell you she was hypochondriacal?)
12378-8{_}621{_}I felt that really and at last I was in for a pleasant visit.
12378-8{_}622{_}The evening proved a short one, for Aunt retired at nine, for which I was not sorry, as by that time the atmosphere of the sitting-room was distinctly stuffy, and neither dinner, nor the fumes of the invalid's hot-and-strong "night-cap" improved it.
12378-8{_}623{_}Next morning I sympathised with her on the fact that, soon after she had gone to bed, the young lady on the drawing-room floor (for two other families shared Frogmore's roof with us) had begun to sing, and had continued her performances till midnight; but I found my commiseration wasted, for she said that it had soothed her, which was considerably more than it had done me.
12378-8{_}624{_}After breakfast--which was late, on account of Aunt's health--I proposed a stroll on the Promenade, or an inspection of the tennis courts.
12378-8{_}625{_}"Bless my soul!"
12378-8{_}626{_}cried Auntie, "a person in my state of health does not go to places all over promenades and tennis courts.
12378-8{_}627{_}You won't find any such things at a nice quiet resort like Flatsands."
12378-8{_}628{_}I felt a little dashed, but replied "that perhaps she was right, and that it was a nice change to be without tennis; and that, as to promenades, they were quite superfluous where there was a pier, and a good band."
12378-8{_}629{_}"A pier, child!"
12378-8{_}630{_}she screamed.
12378-8{_}631{_}"You won't find any such abominations as piers here, or German bands either.
12378-8{_}632{_}Do you think that _I_ should come anywhere where there was a pier?"
12378-8{_}633{_}I felt the smile on my face becoming fixed, but I mastered my feelings sufficiently to murmur something about bathing before lunch.
12378-8{_}634{_}"You can't bathe here," snapped Aunt--"they don't allow it.
12378-8{_}635{_}The shore is too dangerous.
12378-8{_}636{_}But you can come out with me, if you like, to the tradespeople--I see my bath-chair coming along the road."
12378-8{_}637{_}And that, _Mr.
12378-8{_}638{_}Punch_, is how I spent my fortnight at Flatsands.
12378-8{_}639{_}Walking by the side of my Aunt's chair, and giving orders to the tradespeople in the morning; walking beside the same chair and blowing up the tradespeople for not having carried out the orders, in the afternoon; sitting in a hot room from five to nine o'clock, then lying awake till midnight, listening to the drawing-room young lady singing Italian and German songs out of tune, and with an English accent.
12378-8{_}640{_}Three things only occurred to in any way vary the monotony of my existence.
12378-8{_}641{_}The first was the arrival of the singing young lady's brother.
12378-8{_}642{_}He was seventeen, and his lungs were as thick as his boots.
12378-8{_}643{_}He tobogganed down-stairs on a tea-tray the first day he arrived; the second day he passed me in the hall and asked, with a grin, "if I was one of the mummies in this old mausoleum?"
12378-8{_}644{_}the third day he left, saying that the place was "too jolly beastly slow" for him.
12378-8{_}645{_}The second event was the sudden extraordinary mania that Aunt (did I tell you she was rich?)
12378-8{_}646{_}took for the singing lady.
12378-8{_}647{_}I discovered, much to my chagrin, I must say, that often, instead of going to bed at nine, as I believed she did, she used to ensconce herself in the drawing-room, and there sit and listen to indifferent music till all hours.
12378-8{_}648{_}It was this second event which brought about the third excitement.
12378-8{_}649{_}For having been a little imprudent one night, in the matter of "night-caps," or careless as to draughts, my Aunt was taken seriously ill. At least she chose to think herself so, though I now have vague suspicions that the singing lady knew more about it all than she cared to tell.
12378-8{_}650{_}All I know is that the doctor was sent for, and that, after a long confab in the sick room, he came to me and ordered my immediate return home.
12378-8{_}651{_}"Your poor Aunt requires perfect quiet," he said.
12378-8{_}652{_}Having no choice in the matter, I packed my boxes; not exactly with reluctance, but still with an uncomfortable feeling of being wanted out of the way.
12378-8{_}653{_}Aunt's last words to me rather confirmed my suspicions.
12378-8{_}654{_}"Ah!
12378-8{_}655{_}you are off, are you?
12378-8{_}656{_}Well, I may pull through this time--I think I feel better already."
12378-8{_}657{_}Then, with a pecking kiss, and an inaudible remark anent the ingratitude of relations, she dismissed me.
12378-8{_}658{_}As I left the house I distinctly heard that singing creature run up-stairs and into Aunt's room.
12378-8{_}659{_}On the way back to town I decided that she (Aunt I mean) was right--relations are _disgustingly_ ungrateful.

12378-8{_}770{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
12378-8{_}771{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

12378-8{_}781{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
12378-8{_}782{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
12378-8{_}783{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
12378-8{_}784{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
12378-8{_}785{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
12378-8{_}786{_}To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
12378-8{_}787{_}International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
12378-8{_}788{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
12378-8{_}789{_}Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
12378-8{_}790{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

12378-8{_}792{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
12378-8{_}793{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
12378-8{_}794{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
12378-8{_}795{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
12378-8{_}796{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
12378-8{_}797{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
12378-8{_}798{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
12378-8{_}799{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
12378-8{_}800{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
12378-8{_}801{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
12378-8{_}802{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
12378-8{_}803{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
12378-8{_}804{_}http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
12378-8{_}805{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
12378-8{_}806{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
12378-8{_}807{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
12378-8{_}808{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
