G-2_John{_}1{_}The Second Letter  of John  1 	1 The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in  the truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, 2 because of the  truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: 3 grace, mercy, and  peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the  Father's Son, in truth and love.
G-2_John{_}2{_}4 I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the  truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.
G-2_John{_}3{_}5 And now I ask  you, lady, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the  one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
G-2_John{_}4{_}6 And this  is love, that we walk according to his commandments.
G-2_John{_}5{_}This is the  commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you  should walk in love.
G-2_John{_}6{_}7 For many deceivers, who do not acknowledge  Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world.
G-2_John{_}7{_}Any  such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
G-2_John{_}8{_}8 Watch yourselves, that  you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may receive a full  reward.
G-2_John{_}9{_}9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not abide in the teaching of  Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching has both the  Father and the Son.
G-2_John{_}10{_}10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this  teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting; 11  for he who greets him shares in his wicked work.
G-2_John{_}11{_}12 Though I have much to write to you, I do not want to use  paper and ink, but I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to  face, so that our joy may be complete.
G-2_John{_}12{_}13 The children of your chosen  sister greet you.
