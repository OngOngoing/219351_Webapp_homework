G-Matthew{_}1{_}The Gospel  According to  Matthew  1 	1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David,  the son of Abraham:  	2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and  Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, 3 and Judah the father of Perez  and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of  Ram, 4 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of  Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, 5 Salmon the father of Boaz  by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,  6 and Jesse the father of King David.
G-Matthew{_}2{_}David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 7  Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and  Abijah the father of Asa, 8 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the  father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, 9 Uzziah the father of  Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 10  Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and  Amon the father of Josiah, 11 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his  brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
G-Matthew{_}3{_}12 And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of  Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, 13 Zerubbabel the father  of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, 14  Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the  father of Eliud, 15 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of  Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, 16 and Jacob the father of  Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called  Christ.
G-Matthew{_}4{_}17 So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen  generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations,  and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
G-Matthew{_}5{_}18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when  his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she  was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
G-Matthew{_}6{_}19 Then Joseph her  husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame,  was resolved to divorce her quietly.
G-Matthew{_}7{_}20 But as he considered this, behold,  an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of  David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is  conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
G-Matthew{_}8{_}21 And she will give birth to a son,  and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their  sins."
G-Matthew{_}9{_}22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the  prophet:  23	"Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,  		and they shall call his name Immanuel,"  which means, "God with us."
G-Matthew{_}10{_}24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as  the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife, 25 but did not  know her until she had borne a son.
G-Matthew{_}11{_}And he called his name Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}12{_}2 	1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of  Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, 2  saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
G-Matthew{_}13{_}For we have  seen his star in the East and have come to worship him."
G-Matthew{_}14{_}3 When Herod  the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
G-Matthew{_}15{_}4 And  when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people  together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
G-Matthew{_}16{_}5 So they  said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:  6	'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  		are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;  	for out of you shall come a ruler  		who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'"
G-Matthew{_}17{_}7 Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from  them what time the star had appeared.
G-Matthew{_}18{_}8 And he sent them to Bethlehem  and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you  have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and  worship him."
G-Matthew{_}19{_}9 When they had heard the king they went their way; and  behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it  came to rest over the place where the child was.
G-Matthew{_}20{_}10 When they saw the  star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
G-Matthew{_}21{_}11 On coming into the  house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and  worshipped him.
G-Matthew{_}22{_}Then they opened their treasures and presented him with  gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.
G-Matthew{_}23{_}12 And being warned in  a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by  another way.
G-Matthew{_}24{_}13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord  appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his  mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is  about to search for the child, to destroy him."
G-Matthew{_}25{_}14 When he rose, he took  the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt, 15 and  remained there until the death of Herod.
G-Matthew{_}26{_}And so was fulfilled what the  Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt have I called my son."
G-Matthew{_}27{_}16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the  wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male  children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or  under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
G-Matthew{_}28{_}17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:  18	"A voice was heard in Ramah,  		lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,  	Rachel weeping for her children,  		refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."
G-Matthew{_}29{_}19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared  in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 20 saying, "Rise, take the young child and  his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young  child's life are dead."
G-Matthew{_}30{_}21 And he rose and took the child and his mother,  and went to the land of Israel.
G-Matthew{_}31{_}22 But when he heard that Archelaus was  reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.
G-Matthew{_}32{_}And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, 23  and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by  the Prophets might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
G-Matthew{_}33{_}3 	1 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the  wilderness of Judea, 2 and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is  at hand."
G-Matthew{_}34{_}3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when  he said,  	"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:   		Prepare the way of the Lord,  		make his paths straight."
G-Matthew{_}35{_}4 Now John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a leather belt around his  waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
G-Matthew{_}36{_}5 Then Jerusalem and all  Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him, 6 and  confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
G-Matthew{_}37{_}7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming  for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers!
G-Matthew{_}38{_}Who warned you to  flee from the wrath to come?
G-Matthew{_}39{_}8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance, 9 and do  not think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.'
G-Matthew{_}40{_}For I  tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these  stones.
G-Matthew{_}41{_}10 Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree  therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the  fire.
G-Matthew{_}42{_}11 I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming  after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.
G-Matthew{_}43{_}He  will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
G-Matthew{_}44{_}12 His winnowing fork is  in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into  the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
G-Matthew{_}45{_}13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be  baptized by him.
G-Matthew{_}46{_}14 But John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be  baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
G-Matthew{_}47{_}15 But Jesus answered him,  "Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."
G-Matthew{_}48{_}Then he consented.
G-Matthew{_}49{_}16 And when Jesus was baptized, he went up  immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he  saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.
G-Matthew{_}50{_}17  And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with  whom I am well pleased."
G-Matthew{_}51{_}4 	1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be  tempted by the devil.
G-Matthew{_}52{_}2 And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and  afterward he was hungry.
G-Matthew{_}53{_}3 And the tempter came and said to him, "If you  are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
G-Matthew{_}54{_}4  But he answered, "It is written,  	'Man shall not live by bread alone,  		but by every word that proceeds  			from the mouth of God.'"
G-Matthew{_}55{_}5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of  the temple, 6 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself  down.
G-Matthew{_}56{_}For it is written,  	'He will give his angels charge of you,'  		and 'In their hands they will bear you up,  	lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
G-Matthew{_}57{_}7 Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord  your God.'"
G-Matthew{_}58{_}8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and  showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
G-Matthew{_}59{_}9 And he said  to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."
G-Matthew{_}60{_}10 Then Jesus said to him, "Away, Satan!
G-Matthew{_}61{_}for it is written,  	'You shall worship the Lord your God  		and him only shall you serve.'"
G-Matthew{_}62{_}11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to  him.
G-Matthew{_}63{_}12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he  withdrew to Galilee.
G-Matthew{_}64{_}13 And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in  Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,  14 that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:  15	"The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,  		the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,  			Galilee of the Gentiles 16	the people who sat in darkness  		have seen a great light,  	and on those who sat in the region and shadow of death  		light has dawned."
G-Matthew{_}65{_}17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for  the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
G-Matthew{_}66{_}18 As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two  brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net  into the sea; for they were fishermen.
G-Matthew{_}67{_}19 And he said to them, "Follow  me, and I will make you fishers of men."
G-Matthew{_}68{_}20 Immediately they left their  nets and followed him.
G-Matthew{_}69{_}21 Going on from there, he saw two other  brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with  Zebedee their father, mending their nets.
G-Matthew{_}70{_}And he called them, 22 and  immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.
G-Matthew{_}71{_}23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their  synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every  disease and every sickness among the people.
G-Matthew{_}72{_}24 Then his fame spread  throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were  afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon- possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.
G-Matthew{_}73{_}25 Great  crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem,  Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
G-Matthew{_}74{_}5 	1 Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat  down his disciples came to him.
G-Matthew{_}75{_}2 And he opened his mouth and taught  them, saying:  3	"Blessed are the poor in spirit,  		for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}76{_}4	Blessed are those who mourn,  		for they shall be comforted.
G-Matthew{_}77{_}5	Blessed are the meek,  		for they shall inherit the earth.
G-Matthew{_}78{_}6	Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,  		for they shall be filled.
G-Matthew{_}79{_}7	Blessed are the merciful,  		for they shall obtain mercy.
G-Matthew{_}80{_}8	Blessed are the pure in heart,  		for they shall see God.
G-Matthew{_}81{_}9	Blessed are the peacemakers,  		for they shall be called sons of God.
G-Matthew{_}82{_}10	Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake,  		for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}83{_}11 Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all  kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake.
G-Matthew{_}84{_}12 Rejoice and be glad, for  great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who  were before you.
G-Matthew{_}85{_}13 "You are the salt of the earth.
G-Matthew{_}86{_}But if the salt loses its taste,  how shall it be made salty again?
G-Matthew{_}87{_}It is no longer good for anything, except  to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
G-Matthew{_}88{_}14 You are the light of  the world.
G-Matthew{_}89{_}A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
G-Matthew{_}90{_}15 Nor do they light a  lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in  the house.
G-Matthew{_}91{_}16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your  good works and glorify your Father in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}92{_}17 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the  Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
G-Matthew{_}93{_}18 For  truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot,  will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
G-Matthew{_}94{_}19  Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches  men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does  them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}95{_}20  For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes  and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}96{_}21 "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall  not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.'
G-Matthew{_}97{_}22 But I say  to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to  judgment.
G-Matthew{_}98{_}And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be answerable to  the council.
G-Matthew{_}99{_}But whoever says, 'You fool!'
G-Matthew{_}100{_}shall be in danger of the fire of  hell.
G-Matthew{_}101{_}23 Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there  remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift  there before the altar, and go.
G-Matthew{_}102{_}First be reconciled to your brother; and  then come and offer your gift.
G-Matthew{_}103{_}25 Agree with your adversary quickly,  while you are on the way with him to court, lest your adversary deliver  you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be  thrown into prison.
G-Matthew{_}104{_}26 Truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you  have paid the last penny.
G-Matthew{_}105{_}27 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit  adultery.'
G-Matthew{_}106{_}28 But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman  lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
G-Matthew{_}107{_}29 If your  right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away.
G-Matthew{_}108{_}It is better for  you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown  into hell.
G-Matthew{_}109{_}30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw  it away.
G-Matthew{_}110{_}It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your  whole body to go into hell.
G-Matthew{_}111{_}31 "It has also been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him  give her a certificate of divorce.'
G-Matthew{_}112{_}32 But I say to you that every one who  divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to  become an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits  adultery.
G-Matthew{_}113{_}33 "Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You  shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'
G-Matthew{_}114{_}34 But I  say to you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35  or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of  the Great King.
G-Matthew{_}115{_}36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make  even one hair white or black.
G-Matthew{_}116{_}37 Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,'  and your  'No,' 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.
G-Matthew{_}117{_}38 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a  tooth for a tooth.'
G-Matthew{_}118{_}39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
G-Matthew{_}119{_}But if  someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
G-Matthew{_}120{_}40  And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your  cloak as well.
G-Matthew{_}121{_}41 And if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him  two miles.
G-Matthew{_}122{_}42 Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to  borrow from you do not turn away.
G-Matthew{_}123{_}43 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your  neighbor and hate your enemy.'
G-Matthew{_}124{_}44 But I say to you, love your enemies  and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your  Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good,  and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
G-Matthew{_}125{_}46 For if you love those who  love you, what reward have you?
G-Matthew{_}126{_}Do not even the tax collectors do the  same?
G-Matthew{_}127{_}47 And if you greet only your brethren, what more are you doing  than others?
G-Matthew{_}128{_}Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
G-Matthew{_}129{_}48 You, therefore,  must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
G-Matthew{_}130{_}6 	1 "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before  men, to be seen by them.
G-Matthew{_}131{_}If you do, you will have no reward from your  Father in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}132{_}2 "Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before  you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they  may be praised by men.
G-Matthew{_}133{_}Truly, I say to you, they have received their  reward.
G-Matthew{_}134{_}3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know  what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your charitable deed may be in  secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
G-Matthew{_}135{_}5 "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites.
G-Matthew{_}136{_}For  they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners,  that they may be seen by men.
G-Matthew{_}137{_}Truly, I say to you, they have received their  reward.
G-Matthew{_}138{_}6 But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door and pray  to your Father, who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will  reward you.
G-Matthew{_}139{_}7 And when you pray, do not use empty repetitions as the  Gentiles do.
G-Matthew{_}140{_}For they think that they will be heard for their many words.
G-Matthew{_}141{_}8  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask  him.
G-Matthew{_}142{_}9 Pray, then, in this way:  	Our Father in heaven,  		hallowed be your name.
G-Matthew{_}143{_}10		Your kingdom come,  		your will be done  			on earth as it is in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}144{_}11		Give us this day our daily bread.
G-Matthew{_}145{_}12		And forgive us our debts,  			as we also have forgiven our debtors.
G-Matthew{_}146{_}13		And lead us not into temptation,  			but deliver us from evil.'
G-Matthew{_}147{_}14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also  forgive you.
G-Matthew{_}148{_}15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will  your Father forgive your trespasses.
G-Matthew{_}149{_}16 "And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites,  for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting.
G-Matthew{_}150{_}Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
G-Matthew{_}151{_}17 But when you fast,  anoint your head and wash your face, 18 so that you do not appear to be  fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who  sees in secret will reward you.
G-Matthew{_}152{_}19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth  and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up for  yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and  where thieves do not break in and steal.
G-Matthew{_}153{_}21 For where your treasure is,  there your heart will be also.
G-Matthew{_}154{_}22 The lamp of the body is the eye.
G-Matthew{_}155{_}So if  your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
G-Matthew{_}156{_}23 But if your eye  is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
G-Matthew{_}157{_}If then the light in you is  darkness, how great is that darkness!
G-Matthew{_}158{_}24 No one can serve two masters;  for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to  the one and despise the other.
G-Matthew{_}159{_}You cannot serve God and mammon.
G-Matthew{_}160{_}25 "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you  will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put  on.
G-Matthew{_}161{_}Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
G-Matthew{_}162{_}26 Look  at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and  yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
G-Matthew{_}163{_}Are you not of more value than  they?
G-Matthew{_}164{_}27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his span of life?
G-Matthew{_}165{_}28 And why do you worry about clothing?
G-Matthew{_}166{_}Consider the lilies of the field,  how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you that even  Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
G-Matthew{_}167{_}30 Now if God  so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown  into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
G-Matthew{_}168{_}31  Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?'
G-Matthew{_}169{_}or 'What shall we  drink?'
G-Matthew{_}170{_}or 'What shall we wear?'
G-Matthew{_}171{_}32 For the Gentiles seek after all these  things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
G-Matthew{_}172{_}33 But  seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be  given to you as well.
G-Matthew{_}173{_}34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for  tomorrow will worry about itself.
G-Matthew{_}174{_}Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
G-Matthew{_}175{_}7 	1 "Judge not, that you be not judged.
G-Matthew{_}176{_}2 For with the same  judgment you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you  use, it will be measured to you.
G-Matthew{_}177{_}3 And why do you look at the speck in  your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?
G-Matthew{_}178{_}4 Or  how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,'  when there is a plank in your own eye?
G-Matthew{_}179{_}5 You hypocrite, first take the  plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the  speck from your brother's eye.
G-Matthew{_}180{_}6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do  not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their  feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.
G-Matthew{_}181{_}7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;  knock, and it will be opened to you.
G-Matthew{_}182{_}8 For everyone who asks receives,  and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
G-Matthew{_}183{_}9 Or  what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
G-Matthew{_}184{_}10  Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
G-Matthew{_}185{_}11 If you then, who are  evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will  your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
G-Matthew{_}186{_}12  So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do also to them, for this  is the Law and the Prophets.
G-Matthew{_}187{_}13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is  broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.
G-Matthew{_}188{_}14  For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and few are  those who find it.
G-Matthew{_}189{_}15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's  clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
G-Matthew{_}190{_}16 You will know them  by their fruits.
G-Matthew{_}191{_}Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from  thistles?
G-Matthew{_}192{_}17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears  bad fruit.
G-Matthew{_}193{_}18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear  good fruit.
G-Matthew{_}194{_}19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and  thrown into the fire.
G-Matthew{_}195{_}20 Thus you will know them by their fruits.
G-Matthew{_}196{_}21 "Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the  kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in  heaven.
G-Matthew{_}197{_}22 On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not  prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many  mighty works in your name?'
G-Matthew{_}198{_}23 And then will I declare to them, 'I never  knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!'
G-Matthew{_}199{_}24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does  them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
G-Matthew{_}200{_}25 And the  rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that  house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.
G-Matthew{_}201{_}26  And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will  be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; 27 and the rain  descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that  house, and it fell.
G-Matthew{_}202{_}And great was its fall."
G-Matthew{_}203{_}28 And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were  astonished at his teaching, 29 for he taught them as one who had  authority, and not as their scribes.
G-Matthew{_}204{_}8 	1 When he came down from the mountain, great crowds  followed him.
G-Matthew{_}205{_}2 And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying,  "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
G-Matthew{_}206{_}3 Then Jesus put out  his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be clean."
G-Matthew{_}207{_}Immediately  his leprosy was cleansed.
G-Matthew{_}208{_}4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no  one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that  Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
G-Matthew{_}209{_}5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him,  asking for help, 6 and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at  home, in terrible distress."
G-Matthew{_}210{_}7 And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal  him."
G-Matthew{_}211{_}8 But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to have  you come under my roof.
G-Matthew{_}212{_}But only say the word, and my servant will be  healed.
G-Matthew{_}213{_}9 For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.
G-Matthew{_}214{_}And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he  comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
G-Matthew{_}215{_}10 When Jesus  heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I say  to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.
G-Matthew{_}216{_}11 I say to you that  many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}217{_}12 But the sons of the kingdom will  be thrown out into the outer darkness.
G-Matthew{_}218{_}There will be weeping and  gnashing of teeth."
G-Matthew{_}219{_}13 Then to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; be it done  for you as you have believed."
G-Matthew{_}220{_}And his servant was healed at that very  hour.
G-Matthew{_}221{_}14 When Jesus come into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in- law lying sick with a fever.
G-Matthew{_}222{_}15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her,  and she rose and served him.
G-Matthew{_}223{_}16 When evening had come, they brought to  him many who were demon-possessed.
G-Matthew{_}224{_}And he cast out the spirits with a  word, and healed all who were sick.
G-Matthew{_}225{_}17 This was to fulfill what was  spoken by the prophet Isaiah:  	"He took up our infirmities  		and bore our diseases."
G-Matthew{_}226{_}18 Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave  orders to go over to the other side.
G-Matthew{_}227{_}19 Then a certain scribe came and said  to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
G-Matthew{_}228{_}20 And Jesus said  to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of  Man has nowhere to lay his head."
G-Matthew{_}229{_}21 Another of the disciples said to  him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
G-Matthew{_}230{_}22 But Jesus said to him,  "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
G-Matthew{_}231{_}23 And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
G-Matthew{_}232{_}24  And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered  with the waves.
G-Matthew{_}233{_}But he was asleep.
G-Matthew{_}234{_}25 The disciples went and woke him,  saying, "Lord, save us!
G-Matthew{_}235{_}We are perishing!"
G-Matthew{_}236{_}26 And he said to them, "Why  are you afraid, O you of little faith?"
G-Matthew{_}237{_}Then he rose and rebuked the winds  and the sea, and there was a great calm.
G-Matthew{_}238{_}27 And the men marveled, saying,  "What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"
G-Matthew{_}239{_}28 When he had come to the other side, to the country of the  Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs,  exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
G-Matthew{_}240{_}29 And behold,  they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God?
G-Matthew{_}241{_}Have you  come here to torment us before the time?"
G-Matthew{_}242{_}30 Now a herd of many swine  was feeding at some distance from them.
G-Matthew{_}243{_}31 And the demons begged him,  "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine."
G-Matthew{_}244{_}32 And he said  to them, "Go."
G-Matthew{_}245{_}So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the  whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the  water.
G-Matthew{_}246{_}33 Then those who kept them fled, and they went away into the  city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon- possessed men.
G-Matthew{_}247{_}34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}248{_}And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
G-Matthew{_}249{_}9 	1 And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own  city.
G-Matthew{_}250{_}2 And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed.
G-Matthew{_}251{_}And  when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son;  your sins are forgiven."
G-Matthew{_}252{_}3 And behold, some of the scribes said to  themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
G-Matthew{_}253{_}4 But Jesus, knowing their  thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
G-Matthew{_}254{_}5 For which is  easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?
G-Matthew{_}255{_}6 But  that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive  sins"he then said to the paralytic"Rise, take up your bed and go  home."
G-Matthew{_}256{_}7 And he rose and went home.
G-Matthew{_}257{_}8 When the crowds saw it, they  were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
G-Matthew{_}258{_}9 As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew  sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me."
G-Matthew{_}259{_}And he rose and  followed him.
G-Matthew{_}260{_}10 And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many tax  collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
G-Matthew{_}261{_}11  And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does  your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
G-Matthew{_}262{_}12 But when Jesus  heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but  those who are sick.
G-Matthew{_}263{_}13 But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy,  and not sacrifice.'
G-Matthew{_}264{_}For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
G-Matthew{_}265{_}14 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we  and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
G-Matthew{_}266{_}15 And Jesus said  to them, "Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as he is with  them?
G-Matthew{_}267{_}The days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from  them, and then they will fast.
G-Matthew{_}268{_}16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth  on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear  is made worse.
G-Matthew{_}269{_}17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; if  they do, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are ruined.
G-Matthew{_}270{_}But they put new wine into new wineskins, and so both are preserved."
G-Matthew{_}271{_}18 While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler  came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come  and lay your hand on her and she will live."
G-Matthew{_}272{_}19 So Jesus rose and  followed him, and so did his disciples.
G-Matthew{_}273{_}20 And behold, a woman who had  suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and  touched the fringe of his garment.
G-Matthew{_}274{_}21 For she said to herself, "If I only  touch his garment, I shall be made well."
G-Matthew{_}275{_}22 Jesus turned, and when he  saw her he said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well."
G-Matthew{_}276{_}And the woman was made well from that moment.
G-Matthew{_}277{_}23 When Jesus came to  the ruler's house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, 24 he  said, "Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping."
G-Matthew{_}278{_}And they laughed at  him.
G-Matthew{_}279{_}25 But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took  her by the hand, and the girl arose.
G-Matthew{_}280{_}26 And the report of this went through  all that region.
G-Matthew{_}281{_}27 And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed  him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David."
G-Matthew{_}282{_}28 When he had  entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them,  "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
G-Matthew{_}283{_}They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
G-Matthew{_}284{_}29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done  to you."
G-Matthew{_}285{_}30 And their eyes were opened.
G-Matthew{_}286{_}And Jesus sternly warned them,  "See that no one knows it."
G-Matthew{_}287{_}31 But they went out and spread the news  about him all over that region.
G-Matthew{_}288{_}32 As they were going out, behold, a mute and demon-possessed  man was brought to him.
G-Matthew{_}289{_}33 And when the demon had been cast out, the  mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, "Never was anything  like this seen in Israel."
G-Matthew{_}290{_}34 But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons  by the prince of demons."
G-Matthew{_}291{_}35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in  their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing  every disease and every sickness.
G-Matthew{_}292{_}36 When he saw the crowds, he had  compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep  without a shepherd.
G-Matthew{_}293{_}37 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is  plentiful, but the laborers are few.
G-Matthew{_}294{_}38 Therefore pray the Lord of the  harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
G-Matthew{_}295{_}10 	1 And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them  authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease  and every sickness.
G-Matthew{_}296{_}2 The names of the twelve apostles are these: first,  Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of  Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and  Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4  Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
G-Matthew{_}297{_}5 These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: "Do not go  among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans.
G-Matthew{_}298{_}6 But go rather  to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
G-Matthew{_}299{_}7 And preach as you go, saying,  'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
G-Matthew{_}300{_}8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,  raise the dead, cast out demons.
G-Matthew{_}301{_}Freely you have received, freely give.
G-Matthew{_}302{_}9  Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts, 10 nor bag for your  journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy  of his food.
G-Matthew{_}303{_}11 Now whatever village or town you enter, inquire who in it  is worthy, and stay there until you go out.
G-Matthew{_}304{_}12 As you enter the house, give  it your greeting.
G-Matthew{_}305{_}13 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon  it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
G-Matthew{_}306{_}14 And if any one  will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your  feet when you leave that house or town.
G-Matthew{_}307{_}15 Truly, I say to you, it will be  more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and  Gomorrah than for that town.
G-Matthew{_}308{_}16 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.
G-Matthew{_}309{_}Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
G-Matthew{_}310{_}17 But beware of  men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their  synagogues.
G-Matthew{_}311{_}18 You will be brought before governors and kings for my  sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
G-Matthew{_}312{_}19 But when they deliver  you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say;  for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; 20 for it is not  you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
G-Matthew{_}313{_}21  Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and  children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
G-Matthew{_}314{_}22 And  you will be hated by all for my name's sake.
G-Matthew{_}315{_}But he who endures to the  end will be saved.
G-Matthew{_}316{_}23 When they persecute you in one city, flee to  another.
G-Matthew{_}317{_}For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities  of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
G-Matthew{_}318{_}24 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his  master.
G-Matthew{_}319{_}25 It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the  servant like his master.
G-Matthew{_}320{_}If they have called the master of the house  Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!
G-Matthew{_}321{_}26 "So do not fear them.
G-Matthew{_}322{_}For there is nothing covered that will  not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
G-Matthew{_}323{_}27 What I tell you in  the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear,  proclaim on the housetops.
G-Matthew{_}324{_}28 And do not fear those who kill the body  but cannot kill the soul.
G-Matthew{_}325{_}But rather fear him who can destroy both soul  and body in hell.
G-Matthew{_}326{_}29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
G-Matthew{_}327{_}And not one  of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father's will.
G-Matthew{_}328{_}30 But even  the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
G-Matthew{_}329{_}31 Fear not, therefore; you  are of more value than many sparrows.
G-Matthew{_}330{_}32 "Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will  also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}331{_}33 But whoever  denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in  heaven.
G-Matthew{_}332{_}34 "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth.
G-Matthew{_}333{_}I did  not come to bring peace, but a sword.
G-Matthew{_}334{_}35 For I have come  	to set a man 'against his father,  		and a daughter against her mother,  	and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;  36	and a man's enemies will be those of his own household.'
G-Matthew{_}335{_}37 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and  he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38 and  he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
G-Matthew{_}336{_}39 He  who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will  find it.
G-Matthew{_}337{_}40 "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me  receives him who sent me.
G-Matthew{_}338{_}41 He who receives a prophet because he is a  prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous  man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
G-Matthew{_}339{_}42 And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water  because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."
G-Matthew{_}340{_}11 	1 And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples,  he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
G-Matthew{_}341{_}2 Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he  sent word by his disciples 3 and said to him, "Are you the One who is to  come, or shall we look for another?"
G-Matthew{_}342{_}4 And Jesus answered them, "Go  and tell John what you hear and see: 5 the blind receive their sight and the  lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are  raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
G-Matthew{_}343{_}6 And blessed  is he who is not offended because of me."
G-Matthew{_}344{_}7 As they went away, Jesus  began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into  the wilderness to see?
G-Matthew{_}345{_}A reed shaken by the wind?
G-Matthew{_}346{_}8 But what did you go  out to see?
G-Matthew{_}347{_}A man clothed in soft garments?
G-Matthew{_}348{_}Indeed, those who wear soft  clothing are in kings' houses.
G-Matthew{_}349{_}9 Then what did you go out to see?
G-Matthew{_}350{_}A  prophet?
G-Matthew{_}351{_}Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
G-Matthew{_}352{_}10 For this is he of  whom it is written:  	'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,  		who will prepare your way before you.'
G-Matthew{_}353{_}11 Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen  one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of  heaven is greater than he.
G-Matthew{_}354{_}12 From the days of John the Baptist until now  the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it  by force.
G-Matthew{_}355{_}13 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
G-Matthew{_}356{_}14  And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.
G-Matthew{_}357{_}15 He  who has ears to hear, let him hear.
G-Matthew{_}358{_}16 "But to what shall I compare this generation?
G-Matthew{_}359{_}It is like  children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,  17	'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;  		we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
G-Matthew{_}360{_}18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a  demon.'
G-Matthew{_}361{_}19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say,  'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
G-Matthew{_}362{_}But wisdom is justified by her deeds."
G-Matthew{_}363{_}20 Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his  mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
G-Matthew{_}364{_}21 "Woe to  you, Chorazin!
G-Matthew{_}365{_}Woe to you, Bethsaida!
G-Matthew{_}366{_}For if the mighty works which  were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have  repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
G-Matthew{_}367{_}22 But I tell you, it will be  more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
G-Matthew{_}368{_}23 And you, Capernaum,  	will you be exalted to heaven?
G-Matthew{_}369{_}You shall be brought down to Hades.
G-Matthew{_}370{_}For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom,  it would have remained until this day.
G-Matthew{_}371{_}24 But I tell you that it shall be  more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for  you."
G-Matthew{_}372{_}25 At that time Jesus declared, "I thank you, Father, Lord of  heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and  intelligent and have revealed them to babes.
G-Matthew{_}373{_}26 Yes, Father, for this was  your good pleasure.
G-Matthew{_}374{_}27 "All things have been delivered to me by my Father.
G-Matthew{_}375{_}No one  knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the  Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
G-Matthew{_}376{_}28 Come to me,  all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
G-Matthew{_}377{_}29 Take  my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart,  and you will find rest for your souls.
G-Matthew{_}378{_}30 For my yoke is easy, and my  burden is light."
G-Matthew{_}379{_}12 	1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath.
G-Matthew{_}380{_}And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to  eat.
G-Matthew{_}381{_}2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Look, your  disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
G-Matthew{_}382{_}3 He said to  them, "Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those  who were with him: 4 how he entered the house of God and ate the  consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who  were with him, but only for the priests?
G-Matthew{_}383{_}5 Or have you not read in the Law  that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are  innocent?
G-Matthew{_}384{_}6 I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
G-Matthew{_}385{_}7 And if  you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you  would not have condemned the guiltless.
G-Matthew{_}386{_}8 For the Son of Man is Lord of  the Sabbath."
G-Matthew{_}387{_}9 And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue.
G-Matthew{_}388{_}10  And behold, there was a man with a withered hand.
G-Matthew{_}389{_}And they asked him,  "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
G-Matthew{_}390{_}so that they might accuse him.
G-Matthew{_}391{_}11  He said to them, "What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a  pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
G-Matthew{_}392{_}12 Of how much  more value is a man than a sheep!
G-Matthew{_}393{_}Therefore it is lawful to do good on the  Sabbath."
G-Matthew{_}394{_}13 Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
G-Matthew{_}395{_}And he  stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other.
G-Matthew{_}396{_}14 But the  Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him.
G-Matthew{_}397{_}15 Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there.
G-Matthew{_}398{_}And many followed  him, and he healed them all, 16 and ordered them not to make him known.
G-Matthew{_}399{_}17 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:  18	"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,  		my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased!
G-Matthew{_}400{_}I will put my Spirit upon him,  		and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
G-Matthew{_}401{_}19	He will not quarrel or cry out;  		nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
G-Matthew{_}402{_}20	A bruised reed he will not break,  		and a smoldering wick he will not quench,  	till he sends forth justice to victory;  21		and in his name will the Gentiles hope."
G-Matthew{_}403{_}22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was  blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and  saw.
G-Matthew{_}404{_}23 And all the people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son  of David?"
G-Matthew{_}405{_}24 But when the Pharisees heard this they said, "It is only by  Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."
G-Matthew{_}406{_}25  Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided  against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself  will not stand.
G-Matthew{_}407{_}26 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself.
G-Matthew{_}408{_}How then will his kingdom stand?
G-Matthew{_}409{_}27 And if I cast out demons by  Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out?
G-Matthew{_}410{_}Therefore they shall be  your judges.
G-Matthew{_}411{_}28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the  kingdom of God has come upon you.
G-Matthew{_}412{_}29 Or how can one enter a strong  man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man?
G-Matthew{_}413{_}And then he will plunder his house.
G-Matthew{_}414{_}30 He who is not with me is against  me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
G-Matthew{_}415{_}31 Therefore I tell you,  every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against  the Spirit will not be forgiven.
G-Matthew{_}416{_}32 Anyone who speaks a word against the  Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit  will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
G-Matthew{_}417{_}33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the  tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
G-Matthew{_}418{_}34 You brood  of vipers!
G-Matthew{_}419{_}how can you speak good, when you are evil?
G-Matthew{_}420{_}For out of the  abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
G-Matthew{_}421{_}35 The good man out of the  good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of  the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
G-Matthew{_}422{_}36 But I tell you that men will  have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they  have spoken.
G-Matthew{_}423{_}37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your  words you will be condemned."
G-Matthew{_}424{_}38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, "Teacher,  we want to see a sign from you."
G-Matthew{_}425{_}39 But he answered them, "An evil and  adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it  except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
G-Matthew{_}426{_}40 For as Jonah was three days and  three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three  days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
G-Matthew{_}427{_}41 The men of Nineveh  will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for  they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah  is here.
G-Matthew{_}428{_}42 The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this  generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to  hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than  Solomon is here.
G-Matthew{_}429{_}43 "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through  dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
G-Matthew{_}430{_}44 Then he says, 'I will return to  my house from which I came.'
G-Matthew{_}431{_}And when he comes he finds it empty,  swept, and put in order.
G-Matthew{_}432{_}45 Then he goes and takes with him seven other  spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the  last state of that man is worse than the first.
G-Matthew{_}433{_}So shall it also be with this  wicked generation."
G-Matthew{_}434{_}46 While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother  and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
G-Matthew{_}435{_}47 Someone told  him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to  you."
G-Matthew{_}436{_}48 But he replied to the man who told him, "Who is my mother,  and who are my brothers?"
G-Matthew{_}437{_}49 And stretching out his hand toward his  disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
G-Matthew{_}438{_}50 For whoever  does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
G-Matthew{_}439{_}13 	1 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
G-Matthew{_}440{_}2 And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and  sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore.
G-Matthew{_}441{_}3 Then he told them  many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow his seed.
G-Matthew{_}442{_}4  And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and  devoured them.
G-Matthew{_}443{_}5 Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have  much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of  soil.
G-Matthew{_}444{_}6 But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they  had no root they withered away.
G-Matthew{_}445{_}7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the  thorns grew up and choked them.
G-Matthew{_}446{_}8 But other seed fell on good soil and  yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
G-Matthew{_}447{_}9 He who  has ears, let him hear."
G-Matthew{_}448{_}10 The disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to  them in parables?"
G-Matthew{_}449{_}11 And he answered them, "To you it has been given  to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been  given.
G-Matthew{_}450{_}12 For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have  abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken  away from him.
G-Matthew{_}451{_}13 This is why I speak to them in parables, because  seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they  understand.
G-Matthew{_}452{_}14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says:  	'Hearing you will hear and shall not understand;  		and seeing you will see and not perceive.
G-Matthew{_}453{_}15	For this people's heart has grown dull.
G-Matthew{_}454{_}And their ears are hard of hearing,  			and their eyes they have closed,  			lest they should see with their eyes,  		and hear with their ears,  	and they understand with their hearts,  		and turn so that I should heal them.'
G-Matthew{_}455{_}16 But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.
G-Matthew{_}456{_}17  For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see  what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not  hear it.
G-Matthew{_}457{_}18 "Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 when anyone hears  the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes  and snatches away what was sown in his heart.
G-Matthew{_}458{_}This is the seed sown  along the path.
G-Matthew{_}459{_}20 But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is  he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; 21 yet he has  no root in himself, but endures only for a while.
G-Matthew{_}460{_}And when tribulation or  persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.
G-Matthew{_}461{_}22  Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word,  but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,  and he becomes unfruitful.
G-Matthew{_}462{_}23 But the one who received seed on the good  soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit  and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
G-Matthew{_}463{_}24 Another parable he put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom  of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while  men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat,  and went away.
G-Matthew{_}464{_}26 So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the  weeds appeared also.
G-Matthew{_}465{_}27 And the servants of the householder came and  said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?
G-Matthew{_}466{_}How then has  it weeds?'
G-Matthew{_}467{_}28 He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'
G-Matthew{_}468{_}The servants  said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them up?'
G-Matthew{_}469{_}29 But he  said, 'No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat  with them.
G-Matthew{_}470{_}30 Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time  I will tell the reapers.
G-Matthew{_}471{_}Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to  be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'"
G-Matthew{_}472{_}31 Another parable he put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom  of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;  32 it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of  shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make  nests in its branches."
G-Matthew{_}473{_}33 He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like  leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was  all leavened."
G-Matthew{_}474{_}34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and  without a parable he did not speak to them.
G-Matthew{_}475{_}35 So was fulfilled what was  spoken by the prophet:  	"I will open my mouth in parables,  		I will utter things hidden  			since the foundation of the world."
G-Matthew{_}476{_}36 Then he left the crowd and went into the house.
G-Matthew{_}477{_}And his  disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of  the field."
G-Matthew{_}478{_}37 He answered, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of  Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of  the kingdom.
G-Matthew{_}479{_}The weeds are the sons of the evil one, 39 and the enemy  who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the  reapers are angels.
G-Matthew{_}480{_}40 Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in  the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.
G-Matthew{_}481{_}41 The Son of Man will send  out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that  causes sin and all who do evil, 42 and will throw them into the furnace of  fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
G-Matthew{_}482{_}43 Then the  righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
G-Matthew{_}483{_}He who  has ears, let him hear.
G-Matthew{_}484{_}44 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a  field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and  sells all that he has and buys that field.
G-Matthew{_}485{_}45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of  fine pearls, 46 who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and  sold all that he had and bought it.
G-Matthew{_}486{_}47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown  into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; 48 which, when it was full,  they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good  into vessels, but threw the bad away.
G-Matthew{_}487{_}49 So it will be at the end of the age.
G-Matthew{_}488{_}The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous 50 and  throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and  gnashing of teeth."
G-Matthew{_}489{_}51 Jesus asked, "Have you understood all these things?"
G-Matthew{_}490{_}"Yes,"  they said to him.
G-Matthew{_}491{_}52 And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has  been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who  brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."
G-Matthew{_}492{_}53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from  there.
G-Matthew{_}493{_}54 And coming to his own country he taught them in their  synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man  get this wisdom and these mighty works?
G-Matthew{_}494{_}55 Is this not the carpenter's  son?
G-Matthew{_}495{_}Is not his mother called Mary?
G-Matthew{_}496{_}And his brothers James, Joseph,  Simon, and Judas?
G-Matthew{_}497{_}56 And are not all his sisters with us?
G-Matthew{_}498{_}Where then did  this man get all these things?"
G-Matthew{_}499{_}57 And they took offense at him.
G-Matthew{_}500{_}But Jesus  said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country  and in his own house."
G-Matthew{_}501{_}58 And he did not do many mighty works there,  because of their unbelief.
G-Matthew{_}502{_}14 	1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, 2  and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, he has risen from  the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him."
G-Matthew{_}503{_}3 For Herod had  laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of  Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, 4 because John had said to him, "It is  not lawful for you to have her."
G-Matthew{_}504{_}5 And though he wanted to put him to  death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.
G-Matthew{_}505{_}6 But  when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced  before them and pleased Herod, 7 so that he promised with an oath to give  her whatever she might ask.
G-Matthew{_}506{_}8 Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me  here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
G-Matthew{_}507{_}9 And the king was sorry;  but, because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to  her; 10 so he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
G-Matthew{_}508{_}11 And his head was  brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her  mother.
G-Matthew{_}509{_}12 Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and  they went and told Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}510{_}13 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat  to a lonely place by himself.
G-Matthew{_}511{_}But when the crowds heard it, they followed  him on foot from the towns.
G-Matthew{_}512{_}14 When Jesus went ashore he saw a great  throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
G-Matthew{_}513{_}15 When  it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote  place, and it's already getting late.
G-Matthew{_}514{_}Send the crowds away, so they can go  to the villages and buy themselves some food."
G-Matthew{_}515{_}16 Jesus said, "They do  not need to go away.
G-Matthew{_}516{_}You give them something to eat."
G-Matthew{_}517{_}17 They said to  him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."
G-Matthew{_}518{_}18 He said, "Bring  them here to me," 19 Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on  the grass.
G-Matthew{_}519{_}And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to  heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the  disciples gave them to the multitudes.
G-Matthew{_}520{_}20 And they all ate and were  satisfied.
G-Matthew{_}521{_}And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that  were left over.
G-Matthew{_}522{_}21 Now those who ate were about five thousand men,  besides women and children.
G-Matthew{_}523{_}22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go  before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.
G-Matthew{_}524{_}23 And  after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself  to pray.
G-Matthew{_}525{_}When evening came, he was there alone, 24 but the boat by this  time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for  the wind was against them.
G-Matthew{_}526{_}25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus  went to them, walking on the sea.
G-Matthew{_}527{_}26 But when the disciples saw him  walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It is a ghost!"
G-Matthew{_}528{_}And they  cried out for fear.
G-Matthew{_}529{_}27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take  courage!
G-Matthew{_}530{_}It is I; do not be afraid."
G-Matthew{_}531{_}28 And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it  is you, command me to come to you on the water."
G-Matthew{_}532{_}29 So he said,  "Come".
G-Matthew{_}533{_}Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and  came toward Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}534{_}30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and  beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
G-Matthew{_}535{_}31 Jesus immediately  reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little  faith, why did you doubt?"
G-Matthew{_}536{_}32 And when they got into the boat, the wind  ceased.
G-Matthew{_}537{_}33 Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying,  "Truly you are the Son of God."
G-Matthew{_}538{_}34 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
G-Matthew{_}539{_}35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that  surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick, 36 and begged  him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as  touched it were made well.
G-Matthew{_}540{_}15 	1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came  to Jesus and said, 2 "Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the  elders?
G-Matthew{_}541{_}For they do not wash their hands when they eat."
G-Matthew{_}542{_}3 He answered  them, "And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake  of your tradition?
G-Matthew{_}543{_}4 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your  mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.'
G-Matthew{_}544{_}5  But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you  might have received from me is a gift to God' 6 he is not to honor his  father with it.
G-Matthew{_}545{_}Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the  sake of your tradition.
G-Matthew{_}546{_}7 You hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}547{_}Well did Isaiah prophesy about  you, when he said:  8	'These people honor me with their lips,  		but their heart is far from me.
G-Matthew{_}548{_}9	In vain do they worship me,  		teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'"
G-Matthew{_}549{_}10 And he called the people to him and said to them, "Hear and  understand: 11 not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what  comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
G-Matthew{_}550{_}12 Then the disciples came  and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when  they heard this saying?"
G-Matthew{_}551{_}13 He answered, "Every plant which my heavenly  Father has not planted will be rooted up.
G-Matthew{_}552{_}14 Let them alone; they are  blind guides.
G-Matthew{_}553{_}And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a  pit."
G-Matthew{_}554{_}15 But Peter said to him, "Explain the parable to us."
G-Matthew{_}555{_}16 So Jesus  said, "Are you also still without understanding?
G-Matthew{_}556{_}17 Do you not yet see  that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?
G-Matthew{_}557{_}18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart,  and they defile a man.
G-Matthew{_}558{_}19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder,  adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.
G-Matthew{_}559{_}20 These are what  defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
G-Matthew{_}560{_}21 And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region  of Tyre and Sidon.
G-Matthew{_}561{_}22 And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region  came out and cried to him, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David!
G-Matthew{_}562{_}My daughter is severely demon-possessed."
G-Matthew{_}563{_}23 But he did not answer her  a word.
G-Matthew{_}564{_}And his disciples came and urged him, saying, "Send her away,  for she is crying out after us."
G-Matthew{_}565{_}24 He answered, "I was sent only to the  lost sheep of the house of Israel."
G-Matthew{_}566{_}25 But she came and knelt before him,  saying, "Lord, help me!"
G-Matthew{_}567{_}26 And he answered, "It is not good to take the  children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
G-Matthew{_}568{_}27 "Yes, Lord," she said, "yet  even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
G-Matthew{_}569{_}28 Then  Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith!
G-Matthew{_}570{_}Be it done for you as  you desire."
G-Matthew{_}571{_}And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
G-Matthew{_}572{_}29 And  Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee.
G-Matthew{_}573{_}And he  went up on the mountain, and sat down there.
G-Matthew{_}574{_}30 Then great crowds came  to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and  many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.
G-Matthew{_}575{_}31  So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed  made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified  the God of Israel.
G-Matthew{_}576{_}32 Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have  compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days  and have nothing to eat.
G-Matthew{_}577{_}And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest  they faint on the way."
G-Matthew{_}578{_}33 Then his disciples said to him, "Where could  we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?"
G-Matthew{_}579{_}34  And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"
G-Matthew{_}580{_}They said,  "Seven, and a few small fish."
G-Matthew{_}581{_}35 He told the crowd to sit down on the  ground.
G-Matthew{_}582{_}36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given  thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples  gave them to the crowds.
G-Matthew{_}583{_}37 And they all ate and were satisfied; and they  took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
G-Matthew{_}584{_}38  Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
G-Matthew{_}585{_}39 And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region  of Magadan.
G-Matthew{_}586{_}16 	1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they  asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
G-Matthew{_}587{_}2 He answered them, "When  it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.'
G-Matthew{_}588{_}3 And in  the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.'
G-Matthew{_}589{_}You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot  interpret the signs of the times.
G-Matthew{_}590{_}4 A wicked and adulterous generation  seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah."
G-Matthew{_}591{_}So he left them and departed.
G-Matthew{_}592{_}5 When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten  to take bread.
G-Matthew{_}593{_}6 Then Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the  leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
G-Matthew{_}594{_}7 And they discussed among  themselves, saying, "It is because we have taken no bread."
G-Matthew{_}595{_}8 But Jesus,  aware of this, said, "O men of little faith, why do you discuss among  yourselves the fact that you have no bread?
G-Matthew{_}596{_}9 Do you not yet perceive?
G-Matthew{_}597{_}Do  you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many  baskets you gathered?
G-Matthew{_}598{_}10 Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and  how many baskets you gathered?
G-Matthew{_}599{_}11 How is it that you do not understand  that I did not speak to you about bread?
G-Matthew{_}600{_}But beware of the leaven of the  Pharisees and Sadducees."
G-Matthew{_}601{_}12 Then they understood that he did not tell  them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees  and Sadducees.
G-Matthew{_}602{_}13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he  asked his disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"
G-Matthew{_}603{_}14 And  they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others  Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
G-Matthew{_}604{_}15 He said to them, "But who do you  say that I am?"
G-Matthew{_}605{_}16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of  the living God."
G-Matthew{_}606{_}17 And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon  Bar-Jonah!
G-Matthew{_}607{_}For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my  Father who is in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}608{_}18 And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this  rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail  against it.
G-Matthew{_}609{_}19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and  whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you  loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
G-Matthew{_}610{_}20 Then he strictly charged his  disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
G-Matthew{_}611{_}21 From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he  must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief  priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.
G-Matthew{_}612{_}22 Peter  took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, "Never, Lord!
G-Matthew{_}613{_}This shall  never happen to you!"
G-Matthew{_}614{_}23 But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind  me, Satan!
G-Matthew{_}615{_}You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of  the things of God, but the things of men."
G-Matthew{_}616{_}24 Then Jesus said to his  disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take  up his cross and follow me.
G-Matthew{_}617{_}25 For whoever desires to save his life will  lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
G-Matthew{_}618{_}26 What good  will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?
G-Matthew{_}619{_}Or  what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
G-Matthew{_}620{_}27 For the Son of Man is  to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward  each man according to what he has done.
G-Matthew{_}621{_}28 Truly, I say to you, there are  some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of  Man coming in his kingdom."
G-Matthew{_}622{_}17 	1 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his  brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
G-Matthew{_}623{_}2 And he was  transfigured before them.
G-Matthew{_}624{_}His face shone like the sun, and his clothes  became as white as the light.
G-Matthew{_}625{_}3 And behold, there appeared to them Moses  and Elijah, talking with him.
G-Matthew{_}626{_}4 And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good  for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for  you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
G-Matthew{_}627{_}5 While he was still speaking,  behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud  said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
G-Matthew{_}628{_}Listen to  him!"
G-Matthew{_}629{_}6 When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were  filled with awe.
G-Matthew{_}630{_}7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Rise.
G-Matthew{_}631{_}Don't be afraid."
G-Matthew{_}632{_}8 And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one  but Jesus only.
G-Matthew{_}633{_}9 And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus  commanded them, "Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised  from the dead."
G-Matthew{_}634{_}10 And the disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes  say that Elijah must come first?"
G-Matthew{_}635{_}11 Jesus replied, "Elijah is coming first  and will restore all things.
G-Matthew{_}636{_}12 But I tell you that Elijah has come already,  and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished.
G-Matthew{_}637{_}So also  the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands."
G-Matthew{_}638{_}13 Then the disciples  understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
G-Matthew{_}639{_}14 And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and  kneeling before him said, 15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an  epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often  into the water.
G-Matthew{_}640{_}16 And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not  heal him."
G-Matthew{_}641{_}17 Then Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation,  how long shall I be with you?
G-Matthew{_}642{_}How long shall I bear with you?
G-Matthew{_}643{_}Bring him  here to me."
G-Matthew{_}644{_}18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him,  and the boy was cured from that moment.
G-Matthew{_}645{_}19 Then the disciples came to  Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
G-Matthew{_}646{_}20 So he said to  them, "Because of your little faith.
G-Matthew{_}647{_}For truly, I say to you, if you have  faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move  from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to  you."
G-Matthew{_}648{_}22 Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them,  "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men, 23 and  they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day."
G-Matthew{_}649{_}And they were  greatly distressed.
G-Matthew{_}650{_}24 When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half- shekel tax went up to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the  temple tax?"
G-Matthew{_}651{_}25 He said, "Yes."
G-Matthew{_}652{_}And when he came into the house, Jesus  spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon?
G-Matthew{_}653{_}From whom do  the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from  others?"
G-Matthew{_}654{_}26 And when Peter said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then  the sons are free.
G-Matthew{_}655{_}27 Nevertheless, so that we may not offend them, go to  the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first.
G-Matthew{_}656{_}And when  you open its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it  to them for me and you."
G-Matthew{_}657{_}18 	1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the  greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
G-Matthew{_}658{_}2 He called to him a little child, and  put him in the midst of them, 3 and he said, "Truly, I say to you, unless  you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom  of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}659{_}4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the  greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}660{_}5 Whoever receives one little child like  this in my name receives me.
G-Matthew{_}661{_}6 "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me  to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around  his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.
G-Matthew{_}662{_}7 Woe to the world  because of temptations to sin!
G-Matthew{_}663{_}For temptations must come, but woe to the  man by whom the temptation comes!
G-Matthew{_}664{_}8 And if your hand or your foot  causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.
G-Matthew{_}665{_}It is better for you to enter  life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the  eternal fire.
G-Matthew{_}666{_}9 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it  away.
G-Matthew{_}667{_}It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes  and be thrown into the fire of hell.
G-Matthew{_}668{_}10 "See that you do not despise one of these little ones.
G-Matthew{_}669{_}For I tell  you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in  heaven.
G-Matthew{_}670{_}12 What do you think?
G-Matthew{_}671{_}If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of  them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the  mountains in search of the one that went astray?
G-Matthew{_}672{_}13 And if he finds it,  truly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray.
G-Matthew{_}673{_}14 So it is not the will of your Father who is  in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
G-Matthew{_}674{_}15 "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault,  between you and him alone.
G-Matthew{_}675{_}If he listens to you, you have gained your  brother.
G-Matthew{_}676{_}16 But if he will not listen, take one or two others along with  you, so that 'every matter may be established by the word of two or three  witnesses.'
G-Matthew{_}677{_}17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if  he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and  a tax collector.
G-Matthew{_}678{_}18 "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be  bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in  heaven.
G-Matthew{_}679{_}19 Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about  anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}680{_}20 For  where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the  midst of them."
G-Matthew{_}681{_}21 Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how often shall my  brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
G-Matthew{_}682{_}Up to seven times?"
G-Matthew{_}683{_}22 Jesus  said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.
G-Matthew{_}684{_}23  Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to  settle accounts with his servants.
G-Matthew{_}685{_}24 When he began the settlement, one  was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
G-Matthew{_}686{_}25 And as he was  not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and  children and all that he had, and payment to be made.
G-Matthew{_}687{_}26 So the servant  fell on his knees before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will  pay you everything.'
G-Matthew{_}688{_}27 The master of that servant took pity on him,  released him, and forgave him the debt.
G-Matthew{_}689{_}28 But that servant went out and  found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he  laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you  owe.'
G-Matthew{_}690{_}29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him,  'Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.'
G-Matthew{_}691{_}30 But he refused, and  went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.
G-Matthew{_}692{_}31 When his  fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed,  and went and told their master all that had happened.
G-Matthew{_}693{_}32 Then his master,  after he had called him, said to him, 'You wicked servant!
G-Matthew{_}694{_}I forgave you  all that debt because you begged me.
G-Matthew{_}695{_}33 Should not you have had mercy  on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'
G-Matthew{_}696{_}34 And in anger his  master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back  all he owed.
G-Matthew{_}697{_}35 So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you  do not forgive your brother from your heart."
G-Matthew{_}698{_}19 	1 Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away  from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
G-Matthew{_}699{_}2 And  large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
G-Matthew{_}700{_}3 Some Pharisees  came to him to test him.
G-Matthew{_}701{_}They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his  wife for any and every reason?"
G-Matthew{_}702{_}4 And he answered them, "Have you not  read that he who made them at the beginning 'made them male and  female,' 5 and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and  mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?
G-Matthew{_}703{_}6  So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
G-Matthew{_}704{_}Therefore what God has joined  together, let man not separate."
G-Matthew{_}705{_}7 They said to him, "Why then did Moses  command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?"
G-Matthew{_}706{_}8 He  said to them, "Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted  you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
G-Matthew{_}707{_}9 And I  say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries  another woman commits adultery."
G-Matthew{_}708{_}10 The disciples said to him, "If such  is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
G-Matthew{_}709{_}11 But he  said to them, "Not all men can accept this saying, but only those to whom  it has been given.
G-Matthew{_}710{_}12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from  their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by  men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the  sake of the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}711{_}He who is able to accept it, let him accept  it."
G-Matthew{_}712{_}13 Then little children were brought to him that he might put his  hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
G-Matthew{_}713{_}14 But Jesus  said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to  such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
G-Matthew{_}714{_}15 And he laid his hands on them  and went from there.
G-Matthew{_}715{_}16 Now behold, one came up and said to him, "Teacher, what  good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
G-Matthew{_}716{_}17 And he said to him, "Why  do you ask me about what is good?
G-Matthew{_}717{_}There is only one who is good.
G-Matthew{_}718{_}If you  want to enter life, keep the commandments."
G-Matthew{_}719{_}18 He said to him, "Which  ones?"
G-Matthew{_}720{_}And Jesus said, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit  adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, 19 honor  your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
G-Matthew{_}721{_}20 The young man said to him, "All these I have kept.
G-Matthew{_}722{_}What do I still  lack?"
G-Matthew{_}723{_}21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you  possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and  come, follow me."
G-Matthew{_}724{_}22 But when the young man heard this, he went away  sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
G-Matthew{_}725{_}23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard  for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
G-Matthew{_}726{_}24 Again I tell you, it is  easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to  enter the kingdom of God."
G-Matthew{_}727{_}25 When the disciples heard this they were  greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
G-Matthew{_}728{_}26 But Jesus  looked at them and said to them, "With men this is impossible, but with  God all things are possible."
G-Matthew{_}729{_}27 Then Peter answered him, "Behold, we  have left everything and followed you.
G-Matthew{_}730{_}What then shall we have?"
G-Matthew{_}731{_}28  Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when  the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me  will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
G-Matthew{_}732{_}29 And  every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or  children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and  inherit eternal life.
G-Matthew{_}733{_}30 But many who are first will be last, and the last  first.
G-Matthew{_}734{_}20 	1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out  early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
G-Matthew{_}735{_}2 Now when he had  agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his  vineyard.
G-Matthew{_}736{_}3 And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing  idle in the marketplace, 4 and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard  too, and whatever is right I will give you.'
G-Matthew{_}737{_}So they went.
G-Matthew{_}738{_}5 Again he went  out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.
G-Matthew{_}739{_}6  And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle,  and said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day?'
G-Matthew{_}740{_}7 They  said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.'
G-Matthew{_}741{_}He said to them, 'You also go  into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.'
G-Matthew{_}742{_}8 And when  evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, 'Call the  laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the  first.'
G-Matthew{_}743{_}9 And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour,  they each received a denarius.
G-Matthew{_}744{_}10 So when the first came, they thought  they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.
G-Matthew{_}745{_}11  And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,  12 saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you made  them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.'
G-Matthew{_}746{_}13  But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong.
G-Matthew{_}747{_}Did you  not agree with me for a denarius?
G-Matthew{_}748{_}14 Take what is yours and go your way.
G-Matthew{_}749{_}I wish to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.
G-Matthew{_}750{_}15 Is it not lawful  for me to do what I want with my own money?
G-Matthew{_}751{_}Or are you envious  because I am generous?'
G-Matthew{_}752{_}16 So the last will be first, and the first will be  last."
G-Matthew{_}753{_}17 Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve  disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, 18 "Behold, we are going  up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests  and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, 19 and deliver  him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will  be raised on the third day."
G-Matthew{_}754{_}20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to him with her sons  and, kneeling down, asked something of him.
G-Matthew{_}755{_}21 And he said to her,  "What do you want?"
G-Matthew{_}756{_}She said to him, "Grant that these two sons of mine  may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom."
G-Matthew{_}757{_}22  But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking for.
G-Matthew{_}758{_}Are you  able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?"
G-Matthew{_}759{_}They said to him, "We are  able."
G-Matthew{_}760{_}23 He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my  right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has  been prepared by my Father."
G-Matthew{_}761{_}24 And when the ten heard it, they were  indignant with the two brothers.
G-Matthew{_}762{_}25 But Jesus called them to him and  said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their  great men exercise authority over them.
G-Matthew{_}763{_}26 Yet it shall not be so among  you; but whoever desires to become great among you must be your  servant.
G-Matthew{_}764{_}27 And whoever wants to be first among you must be your  slave28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,  and to give his life as a ransom for many."
G-Matthew{_}765{_}29 And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
G-Matthew{_}766{_}30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard  that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of  David!"
G-Matthew{_}767{_}31 The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; but they  cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
G-Matthew{_}768{_}32 And  Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for  you? "
G-Matthew{_}769{_}33 They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened."
G-Matthew{_}770{_}34 And Jesus  had compassion on them and touched their eyes.
G-Matthew{_}771{_}Immediately they  received their sight and followed him.
G-Matthew{_}772{_}21 	1 Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage,  at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, "Go  into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey  tied, and a colt with her.
G-Matthew{_}773{_}Untie them and bring them to me.
G-Matthew{_}774{_}3 If any one  says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and he  will send them immediately."
G-Matthew{_}775{_}4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken  by the prophet, saying:  5	"Tell the daughter of Zion,  	'Behold, your King is coming to you,  		lowly, and sitting on a donkey,  			a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
G-Matthew{_}776{_}6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
G-Matthew{_}777{_}7 They  brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus  sat on them.
G-Matthew{_}778{_}8 And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,  while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
G-Matthew{_}779{_}9  The crowds that went before him and those that followed shouted,  	"Hosanna to the Son of David!
G-Matthew{_}780{_}Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
G-Matthew{_}781{_}Hosanna in the highest!"
G-Matthew{_}782{_}10 And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who  is this?"
G-Matthew{_}783{_}11 So the crowds said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth  of Galilee."
G-Matthew{_}784{_}12 And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who  sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money- changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
G-Matthew{_}785{_}13 And he said to them,  "It is written,  	'My house shall be called a house of prayer,'  		but you have made it a 'den of robbers.'"
G-Matthew{_}786{_}14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he  healed them.
G-Matthew{_}787{_}15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the  wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple,  "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
G-Matthew{_}788{_}they were indignant; 16 and they said to  him, "Do you hear what these are saying?"
G-Matthew{_}789{_}And Jesus said to them, "Yes.
G-Matthew{_}790{_}Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you  have perfected praise'?"
G-Matthew{_}791{_}17 Then he left them and went out of the city to  Bethany, and he lodged there.
G-Matthew{_}792{_}18 In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was  hungry.
G-Matthew{_}793{_}19 And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it, and found  nothing on it but leaves only.
G-Matthew{_}794{_}And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come  from you again!"
G-Matthew{_}795{_}And immediately the fig tree withered.
G-Matthew{_}796{_}20 And when the  disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither away  so soon?"
G-Matthew{_}797{_}21 And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have  faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree,  but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,'  it will be done.
G-Matthew{_}798{_}22 And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if  you have faith."
G-Matthew{_}799{_}23 And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the  elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By  what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this  authority?"
G-Matthew{_}800{_}24 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question;  and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I  do these things.
G-Matthew{_}801{_}25 The baptism of Johnwhere was it from?
G-Matthew{_}802{_}From  heaven or from men?"
G-Matthew{_}803{_}And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If  we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe  him?'
G-Matthew{_}804{_}26 But if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all  hold that John was a prophet."
G-Matthew{_}805{_}27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not  know."
G-Matthew{_}806{_}And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I  do these things.
G-Matthew{_}807{_}28 "What do you think?
G-Matthew{_}808{_}A man had two sons; and he went to the  first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'
G-Matthew{_}809{_}29 He answered,  'I will not,' but afterward he regretted it and went.
G-Matthew{_}810{_}30 Then he went to the  second and said the same thing.
G-Matthew{_}811{_}And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but he did  not go.
G-Matthew{_}812{_}31 Which of the two did the will of his father?"
G-Matthew{_}813{_}They said, "The  first."
G-Matthew{_}814{_}Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the  harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
G-Matthew{_}815{_}32 For John came to you  in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax  collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you  did not afterward repent and believe him.
G-Matthew{_}816{_}33 "Hear another parable: there was a landowner who planted a  vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it and built a  tower.
G-Matthew{_}817{_}And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country.
G-Matthew{_}818{_}34  When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to  get his fruit.
G-Matthew{_}819{_}35 And the tenants took his servants, beat one, killed one,  and stoned another.
G-Matthew{_}820{_}36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first,  and they did the same to them.
G-Matthew{_}821{_}37 Last of all, he sent his son to them  saying, 'They will respect my son,' 38 But when the tenants saw the son,  they said to themselves, 'This is the heir.
G-Matthew{_}822{_}Come, let us kill him and seize  his inheritance.'
G-Matthew{_}823{_}39 So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and  killed him.
G-Matthew{_}824{_}40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what  will he do to those tenants?"
G-Matthew{_}825{_}41 They said to him, "He will put those  wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants  who will give him the fruits in their seasons."
G-Matthew{_}826{_}42 Jesus said to them,  "Have you never read in the Scriptures:  	'The stone which the builders rejected  		has become the chief cornerstone;  	this was the Lord's doing,  		and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
G-Matthew{_}827{_}43 "Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you  and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it.
G-Matthew{_}828{_}44 [And he who falls on this  stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him  to powder."]
G-Matthew{_}829{_}45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,  they perceived that he was speaking about them.
G-Matthew{_}830{_}46 But when they tried  to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be a  prophet.
G-Matthew{_}831{_}22 	1 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying: 2 "The  kingdom of heaven is like a king who arranged a marriage for his son, 3  and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding;  but they were not willing to come.
G-Matthew{_}832{_}4 Again, he sent out other servants,  saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my  oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and everything is ready.
G-Matthew{_}833{_}Come to the  wedding.'"
G-Matthew{_}834{_}5 But they made light of it and went off, one to his own farm,  another to his business.
G-Matthew{_}835{_}6 And the rest seized his servants, treated them  shamefully, and killed them.
G-Matthew{_}836{_}7 The king was enraged.
G-Matthew{_}837{_}He sent his army  and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
G-Matthew{_}838{_}8 Then he said to his  servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not  worthy.
G-Matthew{_}839{_}9 Go therefore to the highways, and invite to the marriage feast as  many as you find.'
G-Matthew{_}840{_}10 And those servants went out into the streets and  gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall  was filled with guests.
G-Matthew{_}841{_}11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he  saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.
G-Matthew{_}842{_}12 And he said  to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?'
G-Matthew{_}843{_}And he was speechless.
G-Matthew{_}844{_}13 Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind  him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness;  there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
G-Matthew{_}845{_}14 For many are called, but  few are chosen."
G-Matthew{_}846{_}15 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle  him in his talk.
G-Matthew{_}847{_}16 And they sent their disciples to him, along with the  Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the  way of God in truth, and you care for no man; for you do not regard the  position of men.
G-Matthew{_}848{_}17 Tell us, then, what do you think?
G-Matthew{_}849{_}Is it lawful to pay  taxes to Caesar, or not?"
G-Matthew{_}850{_}18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why  are you testing me, you hypocrites?
G-Matthew{_}851{_}19 Show me the money for the tax."
G-Matthew{_}852{_}And they brought him a denarius.
G-Matthew{_}853{_}20 And he said to them, "Whose image  and inscription is this?"
G-Matthew{_}854{_}21 They said, "Caesar's."
G-Matthew{_}855{_}Then he said to them,  "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the  things that are God's."
G-Matthew{_}856{_}22 When they heard it, they marveled; and they  left him and went away.
G-Matthew{_}857{_}23 That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no  resurrection, came to him and asked him a question, 24 saying, "Teacher,  Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry  the widow, and raise up children for his brother.
G-Matthew{_}858{_}25 Now there were seven  brothers among us.
G-Matthew{_}859{_}The first one married and died, and having no  children, he left his wife to his brother.
G-Matthew{_}860{_}26 So the second also, and the  third, down to the seventh.
G-Matthew{_}861{_}27 After them all, the woman died.
G-Matthew{_}862{_}28  Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be?
G-Matthew{_}863{_}For  they all had her."
G-Matthew{_}864{_}29 But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because  you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
G-Matthew{_}865{_}30 For in the  resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like  angels in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}866{_}31 But as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not  read what was said to you by God, 32 'I am the God of Abraham, and the  God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
G-Matthew{_}867{_}He is not the God of the dead, but  of the living."
G-Matthew{_}868{_}33 And when the multitudes heard this, they were  astonished at his teaching.
G-Matthew{_}869{_}34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the  Sadducees, they gathered together.
G-Matthew{_}870{_}35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked  him a question, to test him.
G-Matthew{_}871{_}36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment  in the Law?"
G-Matthew{_}872{_}37 Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God  with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
G-Matthew{_}873{_}38  This is the great and first commandment.
G-Matthew{_}874{_}39 And the second is like it:  'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
G-Matthew{_}875{_}40 On these two  commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."
G-Matthew{_}876{_}41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked  them, 42 "What do you think about the Christ?
G-Matthew{_}877{_}Whose son is he?"
G-Matthew{_}878{_}They  said to him, "The son of David."
G-Matthew{_}879{_}43 He said to them, "How is it then that  David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord', saying,  44	'The Lord said to my Lord,  	"Sit at my right hand,  		till I put your enemies under your feet"'?
G-Matthew{_}880{_}45 If David then calls him 'Lord,' how is he his son?"
G-Matthew{_}881{_}46 And no one was  able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him  any more questions.
G-Matthew{_}882{_}23 	1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 "The  scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
G-Matthew{_}883{_}3 So you must observe and  do whatever they tell you.
G-Matthew{_}884{_}But do not do what they do; for they preach,  but do not practice.
G-Matthew{_}885{_}4 They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay  them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with  their finger.
G-Matthew{_}886{_}5 But they do all their works to be seen by men; for they  make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long.
G-Matthew{_}887{_}6  And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the  synagogues, 7 and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men,  'Rabbi.'
G-Matthew{_}888{_}8 But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one  Master, and you are all brethren.
G-Matthew{_}889{_}9 And do not call anyone on earth your  'Father,' for you have one Father, he who is in heaven.
G-Matthew{_}890{_}10 Nor are you to  be called 'Teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
G-Matthew{_}891{_}11 He who is  greatest among you shall be your servant.
G-Matthew{_}892{_}12 For whoever exalts himself  will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
G-Matthew{_}893{_}13 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}894{_}For you  shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter  yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in.
G-Matthew{_}895{_}15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}896{_}For you  travel land and sea to win a single proselyte, and when he becomes one,  you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
G-Matthew{_}897{_}16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If any one swears by the  temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple, he is  bound by his oath.'
G-Matthew{_}898{_}17 You blind fools!
G-Matthew{_}899{_}For which is greater, the gold or  the temple that has made the gold sacred?
G-Matthew{_}900{_}18 And you say, 'If anyone  swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that  is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
G-Matthew{_}901{_}19 You blind men!
G-Matthew{_}902{_}For which is greater,  the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
G-Matthew{_}903{_}20 Therefore, he who  swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
G-Matthew{_}904{_}21 And he who  swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
G-Matthew{_}905{_}22 And he  who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits  on it.
G-Matthew{_}906{_}23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}907{_}For you pay  tithe of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier  matters of the Law, justice and mercy and faith.
G-Matthew{_}908{_}These you ought to have  done, without neglecting the others.
G-Matthew{_}909{_}24 You blind guides, who strain out  a gnat and swallow a camel!
G-Matthew{_}910{_}25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}911{_}For you  cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of  extortion and self-indulgence.
G-Matthew{_}912{_}26 Blind Pharisee!
G-Matthew{_}913{_}First cleanse the inside  of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.
G-Matthew{_}914{_}27 Woe to  you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}915{_}For you are like whitewashed  tombs which outwardly appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead  men's bones and all uncleanness.
G-Matthew{_}916{_}28 Even so you also outwardly appear  righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
G-Matthew{_}917{_}29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
G-Matthew{_}918{_}for you build  the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, 30  And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not  have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
G-Matthew{_}919{_}31 Thus  you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered  the prophets.
G-Matthew{_}920{_}32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers' guilt.
G-Matthew{_}921{_}33 You  serpents!
G-Matthew{_}922{_}You brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to  hell?
G-Matthew{_}923{_}34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes.
G-Matthew{_}924{_}Some  of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your  synagogues and persecute from town to town, 35 that on you may come  all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous  Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered  between the temple and the altar.
G-Matthew{_}925{_}36 Truly, I say to you, all this will come  upon this generation.
G-Matthew{_}926{_}37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone  those who are sent to you!
G-Matthew{_}927{_}How often I have longed to gather your  children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you  were not willing!
G-Matthew{_}928{_}38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
G-Matthew{_}929{_}39 For I  tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who  comes in the name of the Lord.'"
G-Matthew{_}930{_}24 	1 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples  came up to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
G-Matthew{_}931{_}2 But he  answered them, "You see all these things, do you not?
G-Matthew{_}932{_}Truly, I say to you,  there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown  down."
G-Matthew{_}933{_}3 Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to  him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will this be?
G-Matthew{_}934{_}And what will be the  sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
G-Matthew{_}935{_}4 And Jesus answered  them: "Take heed that no one deceives you.
G-Matthew{_}936{_}5 For many will come in my  name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.
G-Matthew{_}937{_}6 And you will  hear of wars and rumors of wars.
G-Matthew{_}938{_}See that you are not alarmed; for all  these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
G-Matthew{_}939{_}7 For nation will  rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be  famines and earthquakes in various places.
G-Matthew{_}940{_}8 All these are the beginning  of birth pains.
G-Matthew{_}941{_}9 Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you  to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
G-Matthew{_}942{_}10 And  then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one  another.
G-Matthew{_}943{_}11 And many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
G-Matthew{_}944{_}12  And because wickedness will increase, the love of most will grow cold.
G-Matthew{_}945{_}13 But he who endures to the end will be saved.
G-Matthew{_}946{_}14 And this gospel of the  kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all  nations, and then the end will come.
G-Matthew{_}947{_}15 "So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination  of desolation,' spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader  understand) 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
G-Matthew{_}948{_}17  Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his  house.
G-Matthew{_}949{_}18 And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.
G-Matthew{_}950{_}19 But woe for those who are pregnant and for those who are nursing  babies in those days!
G-Matthew{_}951{_}20 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on  the Sabbath.
G-Matthew{_}952{_}21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not  been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.
G-Matthew{_}953{_}22  And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved; but  for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
G-Matthew{_}954{_}23 Then if any one  says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'
G-Matthew{_}955{_}or 'There he is!'
G-Matthew{_}956{_}do not believe it.
G-Matthew{_}957{_}24 For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and  wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
G-Matthew{_}958{_}25 See, I have told you  beforehand.
G-Matthew{_}959{_}26 So if they say to you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do  not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
G-Matthew{_}960{_}27 For  as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will  the coming of the Son of Man be.
G-Matthew{_}961{_}28 Wherever the carcass is, there the  eagles will be gathered together.
G-Matthew{_}962{_}29 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days  	the sun will be darkened,  		and the moon will not give its light;  	the stars will fall from heaven,  		and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
G-Matthew{_}963{_}30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all  the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man  coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
G-Matthew{_}964{_}31 And he  will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather  together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the  other.
G-Matthew{_}965{_}32 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch  becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
G-Matthew{_}966{_}33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right  at the door.
G-Matthew{_}967{_}34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till  all these things take place.
G-Matthew{_}968{_}35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my  words will not pass away.
G-Matthew{_}969{_}36 "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels  of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
G-Matthew{_}970{_}37 But as the days of Noah  were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
G-Matthew{_}971{_}38 For as in the days  before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in  marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and they did not  know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the  coming of the Son of Man be.
G-Matthew{_}972{_}40 Then two men will be in the field; one  will be taken and the other left.
G-Matthew{_}973{_}41 Two women will be grinding at the  mill; one will be taken and the other left.
G-Matthew{_}974{_}42 Watch therefore, for you do  not know on what day your Lord is coming.
G-Matthew{_}975{_}43 But know this, that if the  owner of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was  coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be  broken into.
G-Matthew{_}976{_}44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is  coming at an hour you do not expect.
G-Matthew{_}977{_}45 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master  has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
G-Matthew{_}978{_}46  Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so  doing.
G-Matthew{_}979{_}47 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.
G-Matthew{_}980{_}48  But if that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying  away a long time,' 49 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants, and  to eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will  come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not  aware of, 51 and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the  hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
G-Matthew{_}981{_}25 	1 "Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins  who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
G-Matthew{_}982{_}2 Five of  them were foolish, and five were wise.
G-Matthew{_}983{_}3 For when the foolish took their  lamps, they took no oil with them; 4 but the wise took oil in their flasks  with their lamps.
G-Matthew{_}984{_}5 While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered  and slept.
G-Matthew{_}985{_}6 But at midnight there was a cry: 'Behold, the bridegroom!
G-Matthew{_}986{_}Come out to meet him.'
G-Matthew{_}987{_}7 Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their  lamps.
G-Matthew{_}988{_}8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for  our lamps are going out.'
G-Matthew{_}989{_}9 But the wise replied, 'No, there may not be  enough for both us and you; go rather to those who sell oil and buy some  for yourselves.'
G-Matthew{_}990{_}10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and  those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was  shut.
G-Matthew{_}991{_}11 Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open  to us!'
G-Matthew{_}992{_}12 But he replied, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.'
G-Matthew{_}993{_}13  Therefore keep watch, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
G-Matthew{_}994{_}14 "For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his  servants and entrusted his property to them.
G-Matthew{_}995{_}15 To one he gave five  talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his  ability.
G-Matthew{_}996{_}Then he went on his journey.
G-Matthew{_}997{_}16 He who had received the five  talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more.
G-Matthew{_}998{_}17 So also, he who had the two talents gained two more.
G-Matthew{_}999{_}18 But he who  had received the one talent went and dug in the ground, and hid his  master's money.
G-Matthew{_}1000{_}19 Now after a long time the master of those servants  came and settled accounts with them.
G-Matthew{_}1001{_}20 So he who had received the five  talents came and brought five other talents, saying, 'Master, you delivered  to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents.'
G-Matthew{_}1002{_}21 His master  said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful  over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things.
G-Matthew{_}1003{_}Enter into the  joy of your master.'
G-Matthew{_}1004{_}22 He also who had received the two talents came and  said, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two  more talents.'
G-Matthew{_}1005{_}23 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful  servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler  over many things.
G-Matthew{_}1006{_}Enter into the joy of your master.'
G-Matthew{_}1007{_}24 Then he who had  received the one talent came and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard  man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not  scattered seed.
G-Matthew{_}1008{_}25 So I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the  ground.
G-Matthew{_}1009{_}Here you have what is yours.'
G-Matthew{_}1010{_}26 But his master answered him,  'You wicked and lazy servant!
G-Matthew{_}1011{_}You knew that I reap where I have not  sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed?
G-Matthew{_}1012{_}27 Then you ought to  have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would  have received back my own with interest.
G-Matthew{_}1013{_}28 Therefore take the talent  from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
G-Matthew{_}1014{_}29 For to every one  who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him  who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
G-Matthew{_}1015{_}30 And cast the  worthless servant into the outer darkness.
G-Matthew{_}1016{_}There will be weeping and  gnashing of teeth.'
G-Matthew{_}1017{_}31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels  with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
G-Matthew{_}1018{_}32 All the nations will  be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another as a  shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
G-Matthew{_}1019{_}33 And he will put the sheep  on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
G-Matthew{_}1020{_}34 Then the King will say to  those on his right hand, 'Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the  kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 for I was  hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a  stranger and you took me in, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was  sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.'
G-Matthew{_}1021{_}37 Then the  righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed  you, or thirsty and give you drink?
G-Matthew{_}1022{_}38 When did we see you a stranger  and take you in, or naked and clothe you?
G-Matthew{_}1023{_}39 When did we see you sick  or in prison and go to visit you?'
G-Matthew{_}1024{_}40 And the King will answer them,  'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren,  you did it to me.'
G-Matthew{_}1025{_}41 "Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me,  you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his  angels: 42 for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and  you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not take me in,  naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit  me.'
G-Matthew{_}1026{_}44 Then they also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or  thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to  you?'
G-Matthew{_}1027{_}45 Then he will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do  it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'
G-Matthew{_}1028{_}46 And they will  go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
G-Matthew{_}1029{_}26 	1 When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his  disciples, 2 "You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of  Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
G-Matthew{_}1030{_}3 Then the chief priests and the  elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was  called Caiaphas, 4 and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
G-Matthew{_}1031{_}5 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the  people."
G-Matthew{_}1032{_}6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the  leper, 7 a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive  perfume, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
G-Matthew{_}1033{_}8 But when  the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
G-Matthew{_}1034{_}9 For  this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor."
G-Matthew{_}1035{_}10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the  woman?
G-Matthew{_}1036{_}For she has done a beautiful thing to me.
G-Matthew{_}1037{_}11 For you always have  the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
G-Matthew{_}1038{_}12 For in pouring  this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
G-Matthew{_}1039{_}13 Truly, I  say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she  has done will also be told in memory of her."
G-Matthew{_}1040{_}14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went  to the chief priests 15 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I  deliver him to you?"
G-Matthew{_}1041{_}And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
G-Matthew{_}1042{_}16 And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.
G-Matthew{_}1043{_}17 Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the  disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare for you  to eat the Passover?"
G-Matthew{_}1044{_}18 He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and  say to him, 'The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover  at your house with my disciples.'"
G-Matthew{_}1045{_}19 So the disciples did as Jesus had  directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
G-Matthew{_}1046{_}20 When evening had  come, he sat at the table with the twelve.
G-Matthew{_}1047{_}21 And as they were eating, he  said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."
G-Matthew{_}1048{_}22 And they were  very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?"
G-Matthew{_}1049{_}23 He answered, "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will  betray me.
G-Matthew{_}1050{_}24 The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to  that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
G-Matthew{_}1051{_}It would have been better  for that man if he had not been born."
G-Matthew{_}1052{_}25 Then Judas, who was betraying  him, answered, "Rabbi, is it I?"
G-Matthew{_}1053{_}He said to him, "You have said it."
G-Matthew{_}1054{_}26 Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and  broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my  body."
G-Matthew{_}1055{_}27 Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,  saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
G-Matthew{_}1056{_}28 For this is my blood of the covenant,  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
G-Matthew{_}1057{_}29 I tell you, I  will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I  drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
G-Matthew{_}1058{_}30 And when they had  sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
G-Matthew{_}1059{_}31 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of  me this night; for it is written,  	'I will strike the shepherd,  		and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
G-Matthew{_}1060{_}32 But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."
G-Matthew{_}1061{_}33 Peter  declared to him, "Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall  away."
G-Matthew{_}1062{_}34 Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, this very night, before  the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
G-Matthew{_}1063{_}35 Peter said to him,  "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you."
G-Matthew{_}1064{_}And so said all the  disciples.
G-Matthew{_}1065{_}36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called  Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and  pray."
G-Matthew{_}1066{_}37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and  he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
G-Matthew{_}1067{_}38 Then he said to them, "My soul  is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
G-Matthew{_}1068{_}Stay here and watch with me."
G-Matthew{_}1069{_}39  And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, "O my Father, if  it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as  you will."
G-Matthew{_}1070{_}40 Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and  he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?
G-Matthew{_}1071{_}41 Watch  and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation.
G-Matthew{_}1072{_}The spirit indeed is  willing, but the flesh is weak."
G-Matthew{_}1073{_}42 Again, a second time, he went away  and prayed, "O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it,  your will be done."
G-Matthew{_}1074{_}43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for  their eyes were heavy.
G-Matthew{_}1075{_}44 So he left them, went away again, and prayed  the third time, saying the same words.
G-Matthew{_}1076{_}45 Then he came to the disciples  and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting?
G-Matthew{_}1077{_}Behold, the hour is  at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
G-Matthew{_}1078{_}46 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
G-Matthew{_}1079{_}47 While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve,  and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests  and the elders of the people.
G-Matthew{_}1080{_}48 Now the betrayer had given them a sign,  saying, "The one I kiss is the man; seize him."
G-Matthew{_}1081{_}49 And at once he went up  to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!"
G-Matthew{_}1082{_}and kissed him.
G-Matthew{_}1083{_}50 Jesus said to  him, "Friend, why are you here?"
G-Matthew{_}1084{_}Then they came up and laid hands on  Jesus and seized him.
G-Matthew{_}1085{_}51 And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus  stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high  priest, and cut off his ear.
G-Matthew{_}1086{_}52 But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back  in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
G-Matthew{_}1087{_}53 Do  you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me  more than twelve legions of angels?
G-Matthew{_}1088{_}54 But how then could the Scriptures  be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?"
G-Matthew{_}1089{_}55 At that hour Jesus said  to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and  clubs to capture me?
G-Matthew{_}1090{_}Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did  not seize me.
G-Matthew{_}1091{_}56 But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the  prophets might be fulfilled."
G-Matthew{_}1092{_}Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.
G-Matthew{_}1093{_}57 And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas  the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
G-Matthew{_}1094{_}58 But  Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high  priest.
G-Matthew{_}1095{_}He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end.
G-Matthew{_}1096{_}59 Now  the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against  Jesus that they might put him to death, 60 but they found none, though  many false witnesses came forward.
G-Matthew{_}1097{_}At last two came forward 61 and said,  "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it  in three days.'"
G-Matthew{_}1098{_}62 And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no  answer to make?
G-Matthew{_}1099{_}What is it that these men testify against you?"
G-Matthew{_}1100{_}63 But  Jesus remained silent.
G-Matthew{_}1101{_}And the high priest said to him, "I charge you  under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of  God."
G-Matthew{_}1102{_}64 Jesus said to him, "It is as you said.
G-Matthew{_}1103{_}But I say to you,  	hereafter you will see the Son of Man  		sitting at the right hand of the Power,  		and coming on the clouds of heaven."
G-Matthew{_}1104{_}65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken  blasphemy!
G-Matthew{_}1105{_}Why do we need any more witnesses?
G-Matthew{_}1106{_}Look, now you have  heard his blasphemy.
G-Matthew{_}1107{_}66 What do you think?"
G-Matthew{_}1108{_}They answered, "He is  worthy of death."
G-Matthew{_}1109{_}67 Then they spat in his face and struck him with their  fists; and others slapped him, 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ!
G-Matthew{_}1110{_}Who is  the one who struck you?"
G-Matthew{_}1111{_}69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant  girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
G-Matthew{_}1112{_}70 But  he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking  about."
G-Matthew{_}1113{_}71 And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him  and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
G-Matthew{_}1114{_}72  But again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man!"
G-Matthew{_}1115{_}73 After a  little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you are  also one of them, for your accent betrays you."
G-Matthew{_}1116{_}74 Then he began to  invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man."
G-Matthew{_}1117{_}And  immediately the rooster crowed.
G-Matthew{_}1118{_}75 And Peter remembered the word Jesus  had said, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
G-Matthew{_}1119{_}So he  went out and wept bitterly.
G-Matthew{_}1120{_}27 	1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the  people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
G-Matthew{_}1121{_}2 And they bound  him, and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
G-Matthew{_}1122{_}3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he  repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests  and the elders, 4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."
G-Matthew{_}1123{_}And they said, "What is that to us?
G-Matthew{_}1124{_}You see to it!"
G-Matthew{_}1125{_}5 Then he threw down  the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged  himself.
G-Matthew{_}1126{_}6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not  lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the money of blood."
G-Matthew{_}1127{_}7  So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury  strangers in.
G-Matthew{_}1128{_}8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to  this day.
G-Matthew{_}1129{_}9 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,  saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on  whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, 10 and they gave  them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
G-Matthew{_}1130{_}11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked  him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
G-Matthew{_}1131{_}So Jesus said to him, "It is as you  say."
G-Matthew{_}1132{_}12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he  made no answer.
G-Matthew{_}1133{_}13 Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many  things they testify against you?"
G-Matthew{_}1134{_}14 But he gave him no answer, not even  to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.
G-Matthew{_}1135{_}15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for  the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
G-Matthew{_}1136{_}16 And at that time they  had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
G-Matthew{_}1137{_}17 So when they had gathered,  Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas  or Jesus who is called Christ?"
G-Matthew{_}1138{_}18 For he knew it was out of envy that  they had handed him over.
G-Matthew{_}1139{_}19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat,  his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man,  for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
G-Matthew{_}1140{_}20 But the  chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas  and destroy Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}1141{_}21 The governor answered them, "Which of the two do  you want me to release to you?"
G-Matthew{_}1142{_}They said, "Barabbas!"
G-Matthew{_}1143{_}22 Pilate said to  them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"
G-Matthew{_}1144{_}They all  said, "Let him be crucified!"
G-Matthew{_}1145{_}23 And he said, "Why, what evil has he  done?"
G-Matthew{_}1146{_}But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!"
G-Matthew{_}1147{_}24 When  Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting,  he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am  innocent of this man's blood.
G-Matthew{_}1148{_}See to it yourselves."
G-Matthew{_}1149{_}25 And all the people  answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
G-Matthew{_}1150{_}26 Then he released  Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to  be crucified.
G-Matthew{_}1151{_}27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the  Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him.
G-Matthew{_}1152{_}28 And they  stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 29 and when they had twisted  a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand.
G-Matthew{_}1153{_}And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail,  King of the Jews!"
G-Matthew{_}1154{_}30 And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck  him on the head.
G-Matthew{_}1155{_}31 And when they had mocked him, they took the robe  off him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
G-Matthew{_}1156{_}32 Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by  name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.
G-Matthew{_}1157{_}33 And when they came  to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull), 34 they  offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he  would not drink it.
G-Matthew{_}1158{_}35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his  garments among them by casting lots; 36 and sitting down, they kept  watch over him there.
G-Matthew{_}1159{_}37 And they put up over his head the charge written  against him:   THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
G-Matthew{_}1160{_}38 Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on  the left.
G-Matthew{_}1161{_}39 And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their  heads 40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in  three days, save yourself!
G-Matthew{_}1162{_}If you are the Son of God, come down from the  cross."
G-Matthew{_}1163{_}41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked  him, saying, 42 "He saved others; he cannot save himself.
G-Matthew{_}1164{_}He is the King  of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in  him.
G-Matthew{_}1165{_}43 He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for  he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
G-Matthew{_}1166{_}44 And the robbers who were crucified  with him also reviled him in the same way.
G-Matthew{_}1167{_}45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was  darkness over all the land.
G-Matthew{_}1168{_}46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out  with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"
G-Matthew{_}1169{_}that is, "My God, my  God, why have you forsaken me?"
G-Matthew{_}1170{_}47 When some of those standing there  heard this, they said, "This man is calling Elijah."
G-Matthew{_}1171{_}48 Immediately one of  them ran and took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a  reed, and offered it to him to drink.
G-Matthew{_}1172{_}49 The rest said, "Let him alone; let  us see if Elijah will come to save him."
G-Matthew{_}1173{_}50 And Jesus cried out again with  a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
G-Matthew{_}1174{_}51 And behold, the curtain of the  temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the  rocks were split; 52 the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the  saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs  after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
G-Matthew{_}1175{_}54 So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus,  saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified,  and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
G-Matthew{_}1176{_}55 And many women were  also there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee,  ministering to him; 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the  mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
G-Matthew{_}1177{_}57 And when it was evening, there came a rich man from  Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of  Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}1178{_}58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
G-Matthew{_}1179{_}Then Pilate  ordered it to be given to him.
G-Matthew{_}1180{_}59 When Joseph took the body, he wrapped  it in a clean linen cloth, 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had  hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb,  and departed.
G-Matthew{_}1181{_}61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there  opposite the tomb.
G-Matthew{_}1182{_}62 The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief  priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate 63 and said, "Sir, we  remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, 'After three  days I will rise again.'
G-Matthew{_}1183{_}64 Therefore order that the tomb be made secure  until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away,  and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead.'
G-Matthew{_}1184{_}So the last deception  will be worse than the first."
G-Matthew{_}1185{_}65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard;  go your way, make it as secure as you know how."
G-Matthew{_}1186{_}66 So they went and  made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.
G-Matthew{_}1187{_}28 	1 Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to  dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
G-Matthew{_}1188{_}2 And  behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended  from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat  on it.
G-Matthew{_}1189{_}3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as  snow.
G-Matthew{_}1190{_}4 And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.
G-Matthew{_}1191{_}5 But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you  seek Jesus who was crucified.
G-Matthew{_}1192{_}6 He is not here; for he has risen, as he  said.
G-Matthew{_}1193{_}Come, see the place where he lay.
G-Matthew{_}1194{_}7 Then go quickly and tell his  disciples that he has risen from the dead.
G-Matthew{_}1195{_}And behold, he is going before  you to Galilee; there you will see him.
G-Matthew{_}1196{_}Behold, I have told you."
G-Matthew{_}1197{_}8 So they  departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his  disciples.
G-Matthew{_}1198{_}9 And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Hail!"
G-Matthew{_}1199{_}And they came  to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
G-Matthew{_}1200{_}10 Then Jesus said  to them, "Do not be afraid.
G-Matthew{_}1201{_}Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and  there they will see me."
G-Matthew{_}1202{_}11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went  into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had  happened.
G-Matthew{_}1203{_}12 When they had assembled with the elders and consulted  together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 and said,  "Tell them, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we  were asleep.'
G-Matthew{_}1204{_}14 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy  him and keep you out of trouble."
G-Matthew{_}1205{_}15 So they took the money and did as  they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to  this day.
G-Matthew{_}1206{_}16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain  which Jesus had appointed for them.
G-Matthew{_}1207{_}17 When they saw him, they  worshipped him; but some doubted.
G-Matthew{_}1208{_}18 And Jesus came and said to them,  "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
G-Matthew{_}1209{_}19 Go  therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of  the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to  observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you always,  even to the end of the age."
