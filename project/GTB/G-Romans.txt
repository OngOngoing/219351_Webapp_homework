G-Romans{_}1{_}The Letter of Paul  to the Romans  1 1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set  apart for the gospel of God 2 which he promised beforehand through his  prophets in the Holy Scriptures, 3 concerning his Son, who was born of  the seed of David according to the flesh, 4 and declared to be the Son of  God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection  from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
G-Romans{_}2{_}5 Through him we have received  grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of  his name among all the nations, 6 among whom you also are called to  belong to Jesus Christ;  	7 To all in Rome who are beloved of God, called to be saints:  	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus  Christ.
G-Romans{_}3{_}8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,  because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
G-Romans{_}4{_}9 For God is my  witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that  without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, 10 asking that  somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you.
G-Romans{_}5{_}11  For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to  strengthen you12 that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by  each other's faith.
G-Romans{_}6{_}13 I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I  often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so  until now) in order that I might have some harvest among you, just as I  have had among the other Gentiles.
G-Romans{_}7{_}14 I am under obligation both to  Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish: 15 so I am  eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
G-Romans{_}8{_}16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God  for the salvation of everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the  Greek.
G-Romans{_}9{_}17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to  faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
G-Romans{_}10{_}18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all  ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress  the truth, 19 for what may be known about God is plain to them, because  God has shown it to them.
G-Romans{_}11{_}20 For since the creation of the world his  invisible nature, even his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen,  being understood by the things that have been made.
G-Romans{_}12{_}So they are without  excuse; 21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or  give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their  foolish hearts were darkened.
G-Romans{_}13{_}22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools,  23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like  mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
G-Romans{_}14{_}24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to  impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25  because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and  served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
G-Romans{_}15{_}Amen.
G-Romans{_}16{_}26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
G-Romans{_}17{_}Even their  women exchanged natural relations for unnatural.
G-Romans{_}18{_}27 And the men  likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with  passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and  receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.
G-Romans{_}19{_}28 And  since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them  over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done.
G-Romans{_}20{_}29 They were filled  with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity.
G-Romans{_}21{_}Full of envy,  murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of  God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,  31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
G-Romans{_}22{_}32 Though they know God's  righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not  only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who  practice them.
G-Romans{_}23{_}2 1 Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are who  judge another; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you  condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.
G-Romans{_}24{_}2 We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those  who do such things.
G-Romans{_}25{_}3 Do you think, O man, that when you judge those  who do such things and yet do the same yourself, you will escape the  judgment of God?
G-Romans{_}26{_}4 Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness  and forbearance and patience?
G-Romans{_}27{_}Do you not know that God's kindness is  meant to lead you to repentance?
G-Romans{_}28{_}5 But by your hardness and your  impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath  when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
G-Romans{_}29{_}6 For he "will render to  each one according to his works": 7 to those who by patience in doing  good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life; 8  but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey  wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.
G-Romans{_}30{_}9 There will be tribulation and  distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the  Greek, 10 but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the  Jew first and also the Greek.
G-Romans{_}31{_}11 For God shows no partiality.
G-Romans{_}32{_}12 All who  have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who  have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
G-Romans{_}33{_}13 For it is not the  hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of  the law who will be justified.
G-Romans{_}34{_}14 When Gentiles, who have not the law, do  by nature things required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even  though they do not have the law.
G-Romans{_}35{_}15 They show that the requirements of  the law are written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness,  and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them 16 on that day when,  according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men by Christ  Jesus.
G-Romans{_}36{_}17 But if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law and boast  of your relation to God 18 and know his will and approve of what is  excellent, because you are instructed in the law, 19 and if you are sure  that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 20  an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the  embodiment of knowledge and truth21 you, then, who teach others, do  you not teach yourself?
G-Romans{_}37{_}You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
G-Romans{_}38{_}22  You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
G-Romans{_}39{_}You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
G-Romans{_}40{_}23 You who boast in the law,  do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
G-Romans{_}41{_}24 For, as it is written, "The  name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
G-Romans{_}42{_}25  Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the  law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
G-Romans{_}43{_}26 So, if a man who  is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his  uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
G-Romans{_}44{_}27 The one who is not  circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even  though you have the written code and circumcision, are a breaker of the  law.
G-Romans{_}45{_}28 For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true  circumcision something outward and in the flesh.
G-Romans{_}46{_}29 He is a Jew who is  one inwardly; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit,  and not by the written code.
G-Romans{_}47{_}His praise is not from men but from God.
G-Romans{_}48{_}3 1 Then what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of  circumcision?
G-Romans{_}49{_}2 Much in every way!
G-Romans{_}50{_}To begin with, they are entrusted  with the oracles of God.
G-Romans{_}51{_}3 What if some did not have faith?
G-Romans{_}52{_}Will their  faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
G-Romans{_}53{_}4 Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}54{_}Let God be  true, though every man a liar.
G-Romans{_}55{_}As it is written:  	"That you may be justified in your words  	and prevail when you are judged."
G-Romans{_}56{_}5 But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God,  what shall we say?
G-Romans{_}57{_}That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us?
G-Romans{_}58{_}(I speak in a  human way.)
G-Romans{_}59{_}6 Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}60{_}For then how could God judge the world?
G-Romans{_}61{_}7  But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why  am I still being condemned as a sinner?
G-Romans{_}62{_}8 Why not say  as we are being  slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say"Let us  do evil that good may come"?
G-Romans{_}63{_}Their condemnation is just.
G-Romans{_}64{_}9 What then?
G-Romans{_}65{_}Are we Jews any better off?
G-Romans{_}66{_}Certainly not; for we  have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the  power of sin.
G-Romans{_}67{_}10 As it is written:  	"There is none righteous, no, not one;  11		there is no one who understands,  			no one who seeks for God.
G-Romans{_}68{_}12	All have turned aside, together they have become worthless;  		there is no one who does good,  			not even one."
G-Romans{_}69{_}13	"Their throat is an open grave;  		they use their tongues to practice deceit."
G-Romans{_}70{_}"The poison of asps is under their lips."
G-Romans{_}71{_}14		"Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
G-Romans{_}72{_}15	"Their feet are swift to shed blood;  16		in their ways are ruin and misery,  17	and the way of peace they do not know."
G-Romans{_}73{_}18		"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
G-Romans{_}74{_}19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those  who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole  world may be held accountable to God.
G-Romans{_}75{_}20 Therefore no flesh will be  justified in his sight by works of the law, for through the law comes  knowledge of sin.
G-Romans{_}76{_}21 But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart  from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, 22 the  righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
G-Romans{_}77{_}For  there is no difference, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of  God, 24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that  is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as an atoning sacrifice by  his blood, to be received through faith.
G-Romans{_}78{_}This was to demonstrate his  righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins  committed beforehand; 26 and it was to demonstrate his righteousness at  the present time, that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has  faith in Jesus.
G-Romans{_}79{_}27 Where then is our boasting?
G-Romans{_}80{_}It is excluded.
G-Romans{_}81{_}On what law?
G-Romans{_}82{_}On  the law of works?
G-Romans{_}83{_}No, but on the law of faith.
G-Romans{_}84{_}28 For we hold that a man  is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
G-Romans{_}85{_}29 Or is God the God of  Jews only?
G-Romans{_}86{_}Is he not the God of Gentiles also?
G-Romans{_}87{_}Yes, of Gentiles also, 30  since there is one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the  uncircumcised through their faith.
G-Romans{_}88{_}31 Do we then nullify the law by this  faith?
G-Romans{_}89{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}90{_}On the contrary, we uphold the law.
G-Romans{_}91{_}4 1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according  to the flesh, has found?
G-Romans{_}92{_}2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has  something to boast about, but not before God.
G-Romans{_}93{_}3 For what does the  scripture say?
G-Romans{_}94{_}"Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as  righteousness."
G-Romans{_}95{_}4 Now to him who works, his wages are not reckoned as a  gift but as his due.
G-Romans{_}96{_}5 And to one who does not work but trusts him who  justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.
G-Romans{_}97{_}6 So also  David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons  righteousness apart from works:  7	"Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,  		and whose sins are covered;  8	blessed is the man against whom the Lord  		will not reckon his sin."
G-Romans{_}98{_}9 Is this blessedness only upon the circumcised, or also upon the  uncircumcised?
G-Romans{_}99{_}For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as  righteousness.
G-Romans{_}100{_}10 How then was it reckoned to him?
G-Romans{_}101{_}Was it after he had  been circumcised, or before?
G-Romans{_}102{_}It was not after, but before he was  circumcised.
G-Romans{_}103{_}11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the  righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that  he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised,  in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them.
G-Romans{_}104{_}12 And he is also  the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also  walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he  was circumcised.
G-Romans{_}105{_}13 The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that he would  be heir of the world, was not through the law but through the  righteousness of faith.
G-Romans{_}106{_}14 For if those who are of the law are to be the  heirs, faith has no value and the promise is void, 15 because the law  brings wrath, for where there is no law there is no transgression.
G-Romans{_}107{_}16  Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may  be guaranteed to all his descendantsnot only to those who are of the  law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, for he is the father  of us all 17 (as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations")  in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the  dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did.
G-Romans{_}108{_}18 In hope, he  believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he  had been told, "So shall your descendants be."
G-Romans{_}109{_}19 And he did not weaken  in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead  since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the  barrenness of Sarah's womb.
G-Romans{_}110{_}20 He did not waver at the promise of God  through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,  21 being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
G-Romans{_}111{_}22 That is why it was "reckoned to him as righteousness."
G-Romans{_}112{_}23 But the  words, "it was reckoned to him," were written not for his sake alone, 24  but for us also.
G-Romans{_}113{_}It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised  from the dead Jesus our Lord, 25 who was delivered to death for our sins  and was raised for our justification.
G-Romans{_}114{_}5 1 Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom we have  obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice  in our hope of the glory of God.
G-Romans{_}115{_}3 And not only that, but we rejoice in our  sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; 4 and  perseverance, character; and character, hope.
G-Romans{_}116{_}5 And hope does not  disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the  Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
G-Romans{_}117{_}6 When we were still weak, at the  right time Christ died for the ungodly.
G-Romans{_}118{_}7 Why, one will hardly die for a  righteous manthough perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die.
G-Romans{_}119{_}8 But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still  sinners Christ died for us.
G-Romans{_}120{_}9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified  by his blood, much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of  God.
G-Romans{_}121{_}10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God  through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall  we be saved by his life.
G-Romans{_}122{_}11 Not only so, but we also rejoice in God  through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our  reconciliation.
G-Romans{_}123{_}12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and  death through sin, so death spread to all men, because all men sinned.
G-Romans{_}124{_}(13  For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted  when there is no law.
G-Romans{_}125{_}14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to  Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of  Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.
G-Romans{_}126{_}15 But the free gift is  not like the trespass.
G-Romans{_}127{_}For if by the one man's trespass many died, much  more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus  Christ, abounded to many.
G-Romans{_}128{_}16 And the free gift is not like the effect of  that one man's sin.
G-Romans{_}129{_}For the judgment following one trespass brought  condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.
G-Romans{_}130{_}17 For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man,  much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift  of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)
G-Romans{_}131{_}18 So  then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's  act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.
G-Romans{_}132{_}19 For just  as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners,  so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made  righteous.
G-Romans{_}133{_}20 Law came in, that the trespass might increase.
G-Romans{_}134{_}But where sin  increased, grace abounded all the more, 21 so that, as sin reigned in  death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through  Jesus Christ our Lord.
G-Romans{_}135{_}6 1 What shall we say then?
G-Romans{_}136{_}Shall we continue in sin that grace  may abound?
G-Romans{_}137{_}2 Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}138{_}How can we who died to sin live any longer  in it?
G-Romans{_}139{_}3 Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ  Jesus were baptized into his death?
G-Romans{_}140{_}4 We were buried therefore with him  through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the  dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
G-Romans{_}141{_}5  For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly  also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
G-Romans{_}142{_}6 We know that our old  self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away  with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
G-Romans{_}143{_}7 For he who has died has  been freed from sin.
G-Romans{_}144{_}8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we  shall also live with him.
G-Romans{_}145{_}9 For we know that Christ, being raised from the  dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.
G-Romans{_}146{_}10 The  death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to  God.
G-Romans{_}147{_}11 So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in  Christ Jesus.
G-Romans{_}148{_}12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you  obey its passions.
G-Romans{_}149{_}13 Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of  wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought  from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of  righteousness.
G-Romans{_}150{_}14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are  not under law but under grace.
G-Romans{_}151{_}15 What then?
G-Romans{_}152{_}Shall we sin because we are not under law but  under grace?
G-Romans{_}153{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}154{_}16 Do you not know that if you yield  yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom  you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which  leads to righteousness?
G-Romans{_}155{_}17 But thanks be to God, that you who were once  slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of  teaching to which you were committed, 18 and, having been set free from  sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.
G-Romans{_}156{_}19 I am speaking in human  terms, because of the weakness of your flesh.
G-Romans{_}157{_}For just as you once yielded  your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now  yield your members to righteousness for holiness.
G-Romans{_}158{_}20 When you were  slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
G-Romans{_}159{_}21 But then what  return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed?
G-Romans{_}160{_}The  end of those things is death.
G-Romans{_}161{_}22 But now that you have been set free from  sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its  end, eternal life.
G-Romans{_}162{_}23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God  is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
G-Romans{_}163{_}7 	1 Do you not know, brethrenfor I am speaking to those who  know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he  lives?
G-Romans{_}164{_}2 For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as  he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her  husband.
G-Romans{_}165{_}3 So then, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with  another man while her husband is alive.
G-Romans{_}166{_}But if her husband dies, she is  free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an  adulteress.
G-Romans{_}167{_}4 Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the  body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised  from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God.
G-Romans{_}168{_}5 While we were  living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work  in our members to bear fruit for death.
G-Romans{_}169{_}6 But now, by dying to what once  held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new  way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
G-Romans{_}170{_}7 What shall we say, then?
G-Romans{_}171{_}Is the law sin?
G-Romans{_}172{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}173{_}Indeed,  I would not have known what sin was except through the law.
G-Romans{_}174{_}For I would  not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "You  shall not covet."
G-Romans{_}175{_}8 But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment,  produced in me all kinds of covetous desire.
G-Romans{_}176{_}For apart from the law sin  lies dead.
G-Romans{_}177{_}9 I was once alive apart from the law, but when the  commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
G-Romans{_}178{_}10 The very  commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me.
G-Romans{_}179{_}11 For  sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it  killed me.
G-Romans{_}180{_}12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just  and good.
G-Romans{_}181{_}13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me?
G-Romans{_}182{_}Certainly  not!
G-Romans{_}183{_}But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order  that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin  might become sinful beyond measure.
G-Romans{_}184{_}14 We know that the law is  spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.
G-Romans{_}185{_}15 I do not understand what I  do.
G-Romans{_}186{_}For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.
G-Romans{_}187{_}16 Now if I do  what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
G-Romans{_}188{_}17 So then, it is no  longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
G-Romans{_}189{_}18 For I know that  nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh.
G-Romans{_}190{_}I can will to do what  is good, but I cannot do it.
G-Romans{_}191{_}19 For I do not do the good I want to do; but  the evil I do not want to do is what I do.
G-Romans{_}192{_}20 Now if I do what I do not  want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
G-Romans{_}193{_}21  So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with  me.
G-Romans{_}194{_}22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I see in  my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making  me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.
G-Romans{_}195{_}24 Wretched  man that I am!
G-Romans{_}196{_}Who will deliver me from this body of death?
G-Romans{_}197{_}25 Thanks  be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord!
G-Romans{_}198{_}So then, I of myself serve the  law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
G-Romans{_}199{_}8 	1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in  Christ Jesus.
G-Romans{_}200{_}2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me  free from the law of sin and death.
G-Romans{_}201{_}3 For what the law could not do, in  that it was weakened through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son  in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin: he condemned sin in the flesh,  4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in  us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
G-Romans{_}202{_}5  For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of  the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the  things of the Spirit.
G-Romans{_}203{_}6 To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the  mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
G-Romans{_}204{_}7 For the mind that is set on the flesh  is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so; 8 and  those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
G-Romans{_}205{_}9 But you are not in the  flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you.
G-Romans{_}206{_}And  if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.
G-Romans{_}207{_}10  But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your  spirit is alive because of righteousness.
G-Romans{_}208{_}11 If the Spirit of him who raised  Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead  will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in  you.
G-Romans{_}209{_}12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live  according to the flesh.
G-Romans{_}210{_}13 For if you live according to the flesh you will  die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will  live.
G-Romans{_}211{_}14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
G-Romans{_}212{_}15 For  you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received  the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father."
G-Romans{_}213{_}16 The Spirit  himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and  if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if  indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with  him.
G-Romans{_}214{_}18 I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not  worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us.
G-Romans{_}215{_}19 For the  creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.
G-Romans{_}216{_}20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by  the will of him who subjected it in hope; 21 because the creation itself  will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty  of the children of God.
G-Romans{_}217{_}22 We know that the whole creation has been  groaning in birth pangs together until now.
G-Romans{_}218{_}23 And not only the creation,  but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as  we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
G-Romans{_}219{_}24  For in this hope we were saved.
G-Romans{_}220{_}But hope that is seen is not hope.
G-Romans{_}221{_}For  who hopes for what he sees?
G-Romans{_}222{_}25 But if we hope for what we do not see,  we wait for it with patience.
G-Romans{_}223{_}26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not  know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for  us with groans that words cannot express.
G-Romans{_}224{_}27 And he who searches the  hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit  intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
G-Romans{_}225{_}28 And we know  that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are  called according to his purpose.
G-Romans{_}226{_}29 For those whom he foreknew he also  predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the  firstborn among many brethren.
G-Romans{_}227{_}30 And those whom he predestined, he  also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he  justified, he also glorified.
G-Romans{_}228{_}31 What then shall we say to this?
G-Romans{_}229{_}If God is for us, who can be  against us?
G-Romans{_}230{_}32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us  all, how will he not also give us all things with him?
G-Romans{_}231{_}33 Who shall bring  any charge against God's elect?
G-Romans{_}232{_}It is God who justifies.
G-Romans{_}233{_}34 Who is he who  condemns?
G-Romans{_}234{_}It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the  dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us.
G-Romans{_}235{_}35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
G-Romans{_}236{_}Shall tribulation, or  distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
G-Romans{_}237{_}36  As it is written:  	"For your sake we are being killed all the day long;  		we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."
G-Romans{_}238{_}37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who  loved us.
G-Romans{_}239{_}38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor  principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, 39 nor  height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate  us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
G-Romans{_}240{_}9 	1 I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my  conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit, 2 that I have great sorrow  and unceasing anguish in my heart.
G-Romans{_}241{_}3 For I could wish that I myself were  accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen  according to the flesh.
G-Romans{_}242{_}4 They are Israelites, and to them belong the  adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and  the promises.
G-Romans{_}243{_}5 Of them are the patriarchs, and from them, according to  the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, forever blessed.
G-Romans{_}244{_}Amen.
G-Romans{_}245{_}6 But it is not as though the word of God had failed.
G-Romans{_}246{_}For not all  who are descended from Israel are Israel, 7 nor are they all children of  Abraham because they are his descendants; but, "Through Isaac shall your  descendants be named."
G-Romans{_}247{_}8 In other words, it is not the children of the  flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are  reckoned as descendants.
G-Romans{_}248{_}9 For this is what the promise said: "About this  time I will return and Sarah shall have a son."
G-Romans{_}249{_}10 And not only so, but  also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our father Isaac,  11 though the twins were not yet born and had done nothing either good  or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might stand, not because of  works but because of his call, 12 she was told, "The older will serve the  younger."
G-Romans{_}250{_}13 As it is written,  	"Jacob I loved,  		but Esau I hated."
G-Romans{_}251{_}14 What shall we say then?
G-Romans{_}252{_}Is there injustice with God?
G-Romans{_}253{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}254{_}15 For he says to Moses,  	"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,  		and I will have compassion  			on whom I have compassion."
G-Romans{_}255{_}16 So it depends not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy.
G-Romans{_}256{_}17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "I have raised you up for this very  purpose, that I may show my power in you, and that my name may be  proclaimed in all the earth."
G-Romans{_}257{_}18 Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills,  and he hardens the heart of whom he wills.
G-Romans{_}258{_}19 You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault?
G-Romans{_}259{_}For  who can resist his will?"
G-Romans{_}260{_}20 But who are you, O man, to answer back to  God?
G-Romans{_}261{_}Will what is formed say to him who formed it, "Why have you made  me like this?"
G-Romans{_}262{_}21 Does not the potter have right over the clay, to make out  of the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?
G-Romans{_}263{_}22 What  if God, choosing to show his wrath and to make his power known,  endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,  23 in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy,  which he has prepared beforehand for glory, 24 even us whom he has  called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
G-Romans{_}264{_}25 As indeed  he says in Hosea:  	"I will call them who were not my people 'my people,'  		and her who was not beloved I will call 'my beloved.'"
G-Romans{_}265{_}26	"And it will happen that in the very place  		where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,'  			they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
G-Romans{_}266{_}27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the  sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
G-Romans{_}267{_}28  For the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth with speed and  finality."
G-Romans{_}268{_}29 And as Isaiah said:  	"Unless the Lord of hosts had left us children,  		we would have become like Sodom,  		and we would have been made like Gomorrah."
G-Romans{_}269{_}30 What shall we say, then?
G-Romans{_}270{_}That Gentiles who did not pursue  righteousness have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; 31 but  Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, has not attained that law.
G-Romans{_}271{_}32  Why?
G-Romans{_}272{_}Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works.
G-Romans{_}273{_}They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, 33 as it is written:  	"Behold, I lay in Zion a stone that will make men stumble,  		and a rock that will make them fall;  	and he who believes in him will not be put to shame."
G-Romans{_}274{_}10 	1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that  they may be saved.
G-Romans{_}275{_}2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for  God, but it is not according to knowledge.
G-Romans{_}276{_}3 For, being ignorant of the  righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own,  they did not submit to God's righteousness.
G-Romans{_}277{_}4 For Christ is the end of the  law, that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
G-Romans{_}278{_}5 For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law,  "The man who does those things shall live by them."
G-Romans{_}279{_}6 But the  righteousness based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will  ascend into heaven?'"
G-Romans{_}280{_}(that is, to bring Christ down) 7 or "Who will  descend into the abyss?"
G-Romans{_}281{_}(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
G-Romans{_}282{_}8 But  what does it say?
G-Romans{_}283{_}"The word is near you,  		in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith which we preach); 9 because, if you confess  with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God  raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
G-Romans{_}284{_}10 For man believes with his  heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his mouth and so is saved.
G-Romans{_}285{_}11 The scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to shame."
G-Romans{_}286{_}12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is  Lord of all and bestows his riches on all who call upon him.
G-Romans{_}287{_}13 For,  "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
G-Romans{_}288{_}14 How then can they call on him in whom they have not  believed?
G-Romans{_}289{_}And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
G-Romans{_}290{_}And how can they hear without a preacher?
G-Romans{_}291{_}15 And how can they preach  unless they are sent?
G-Romans{_}292{_}As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those  who preach good news!"
G-Romans{_}293{_}16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
G-Romans{_}294{_}For  Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
G-Romans{_}295{_}17 So faith comes  from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
G-Romans{_}296{_}18 But I ask, have they  not heard?
G-Romans{_}297{_}Indeed they have; for  	"Their voice has gone out to all the earth,  		and their words to the ends of the world."
G-Romans{_}298{_}19 Again I ask, did Israel not understand?
G-Romans{_}299{_}First Moses says,  	"I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;  		by a foolish nation I will make you angry."
G-Romans{_}300{_}20 But Isaiah is very bold and says,  	"I was found by those who did not seek me;  		I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
G-Romans{_}301{_}21 But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a  disobedient and contrary people."
G-Romans{_}302{_}11 	1 I ask, then, has God rejected his people?
G-Romans{_}303{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}304{_}I  myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of  Benjamin.
G-Romans{_}305{_}2 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.
G-Romans{_}306{_}Do you  not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God  against Israel? 3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down  your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."
G-Romans{_}307{_}4 But what is  God's reply to him?
G-Romans{_}308{_}"I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who  have not bowed the knee to Baal."
G-Romans{_}309{_}5 So too at the present time there is a  remnant, chosen by grace.
G-Romans{_}310{_}6 And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on  the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.
G-Romans{_}311{_}7 What  then?
G-Romans{_}312{_}Israel did not obtain what it sought.
G-Romans{_}313{_}The elect obtained it, but the  rest were hardened, 8 as it is written:  	"God gave them a spirit of stupor,  		eyes that they should not see  		and ears that they should not hear,  	down to this very day."
G-Romans{_}314{_}9 And David says:  	"Let their table become a snare and a trap,  		a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
G-Romans{_}315{_}10	Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,  		and bend their backs forever."
G-Romans{_}316{_}11 So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall?
G-Romans{_}317{_}Certainly not!
G-Romans{_}318{_}But  through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel  jealous.
G-Romans{_}319{_}12 Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their  failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness  mean!
G-Romans{_}320{_}13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles.
G-Romans{_}321{_}Inasmuch then as I am an  apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 14 in the hope that I may  somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of  them.
G-Romans{_}322{_}15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will  their acceptance be but life from the dead?
G-Romans{_}323{_}16 If the dough offered as  firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so  are the branches.
G-Romans{_}324{_}17 And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild  olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive  tree, 18 do not boast over the branches.
G-Romans{_}325{_}If you do boast, remember that  you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
G-Romans{_}326{_}19 You will say  then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
G-Romans{_}327{_}20 That is  true.
G-Romans{_}328{_}They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast  only by faith.
G-Romans{_}329{_}So do not be proud, but stand in awe.
G-Romans{_}330{_}21 For if God did not  spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
G-Romans{_}331{_}22 Therefore  consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who  fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness;  otherwise you also will be cut off.
G-Romans{_}332{_}23 And they also, if they do not persist  in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
G-Romans{_}333{_}24  For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were  grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more  will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!
G-Romans{_}334{_}25 I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so  that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part  until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
G-Romans{_}335{_}26 And so all Israel will  be saved, as it is written:  	"The Deliverer will come from Zion,  		he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;  27	and this will be my covenant with them  		when I take away their sins."
G-Romans{_}336{_}28 As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as  regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
G-Romans{_}337{_}29 For  the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
G-Romans{_}338{_}30 Just as you were once  disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their  disobedience, 31 so they have now been disobedient in order that by the  mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.
G-Romans{_}339{_}32 For God has bound  all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.
G-Romans{_}340{_}33 Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge  of God!
G-Romans{_}341{_}How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding  out!
G-Romans{_}342{_}34	 "For who has known the mind of the Lord?
G-Romans{_}343{_}Or who has been his counselor?"
G-Romans{_}344{_}35	"Or who has given a gift to him  		that he might be repaid?"
G-Romans{_}345{_}36 For from him and through him and to him are all things.
G-Romans{_}346{_}To him be  glory forever.
G-Romans{_}347{_}Amen.
G-Romans{_}348{_}12 	1 I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to  present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,  which is your spiritual worship.
G-Romans{_}349{_}2 Do not be conformed to this world but  be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is  the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
G-Romans{_}350{_}3 For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not  to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with  sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has  assigned him.
G-Romans{_}351{_}4 For as in one body we have many members, and all the  members do not have the same function, 5 so we, though many, are one  body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
G-Romans{_}352{_}6 Having gifts  that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy,  in proportion to our faith; 7 if service, let us use it in our serving; he who  teaches, in his teaching; 8 he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives,  with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who does acts of mercy,  with cheerfulness.
G-Romans{_}353{_}9 Let love be genuine.
G-Romans{_}354{_}Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
G-Romans{_}355{_}10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in  showing honor.
G-Romans{_}356{_}11 Never be lacking in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serving  the Lord.
G-Romans{_}357{_}12 Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be faithful in  prayer.
G-Romans{_}358{_}13 Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.
G-Romans{_}359{_}14  Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
G-Romans{_}360{_}15 Rejoice with  those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
G-Romans{_}361{_}16 Live in harmony with  one another.
G-Romans{_}362{_}Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly.
G-Romans{_}363{_}Do not be  conceited.
G-Romans{_}364{_}17 Repay no one evil for evil, but have regard for what is noble  in the sight of all.
G-Romans{_}365{_}18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live  peaceably with all.
G-Romans{_}366{_}19 Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but leave it to  the wrath of God; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," says  the Lord.
G-Romans{_}367{_}20 No, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give  him drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head."
G-Romans{_}368{_}21  Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
G-Romans{_}369{_}13 	1 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities.
G-Romans{_}370{_}For  there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have  been instituted by God.
G-Romans{_}371{_}2 Therefore he who resists the authority resists  what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring judgment on  themselves.
G-Romans{_}372{_}3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil.
G-Romans{_}373{_}Do  you want to have no fear of him who is in authority?
G-Romans{_}374{_}Then do what is  good, and you will have praise from him.
G-Romans{_}375{_}4 For he is God's servant to you  for good.
G-Romans{_}376{_}But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword  in vain; he is God's servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the  wrongdoer.
G-Romans{_}377{_}5 Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath  but also for the sake of conscience.
G-Romans{_}378{_}6 For the same reason you also pay  taxes, for the authorities are God's ministers, attending to this very thing.
G-Romans{_}379{_}7 Pay all of them their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to  whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom  honor is due.
G-Romans{_}380{_}8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who  loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
G-Romans{_}381{_}9 The commandments, "You shall  not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal,"  "You shall not covet," and any other commandment there may be, are  summed up in this sentence, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
G-Romans{_}382{_}10 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of  the law.
G-Romans{_}383{_}11 And do this, knowing the hour, that now it is full time for  you to wake from sleep.
G-Romans{_}384{_}For now our salvation is nearer than when we  first believed.
G-Romans{_}385{_}12 The night is far gone, the day is at hand.
G-Romans{_}386{_}Let us then cast  off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
G-Romans{_}387{_}13 Let us walk  properly, as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness  and lust, not in quarreling and jealousy.
G-Romans{_}388{_}14 But put on the Lord Jesus  Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.
G-Romans{_}389{_}14 	1 As for the man who is weak in faith, accept him, but not for  disputes over opinions.
G-Romans{_}390{_}2 One believes he may eat anything, but the man  whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.
G-Romans{_}391{_}3 Let not him who eats despise  him who does not, and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on  him who eats; for God has accepted him.
G-Romans{_}392{_}4 Who are you to judge the  servant of another?
G-Romans{_}393{_}To his own master he stands or falls.
G-Romans{_}394{_}And he will be  made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand.
G-Romans{_}395{_}5 One man  esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day  alike.
G-Romans{_}396{_}Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.
G-Romans{_}397{_}6 He who  observes the day, observes it to the Lord.
G-Romans{_}398{_}He who eats, eats to the Lord,  for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and  gives thanks to God.
G-Romans{_}399{_}7 For none of us lives to himself, and none of us  dies to himself.
G-Romans{_}400{_}8 If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to  the Lord.
G-Romans{_}401{_}So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
G-Romans{_}402{_}9  For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of  the dead and of the living.
G-Romans{_}403{_}10 Why do you judge your brother?
G-Romans{_}404{_}Or you,  why do you despise your brother?
G-Romans{_}405{_}For we shall all stand before the  judgment seat of God.
G-Romans{_}406{_}11 For it is written:  	"As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,  		and every tongue shall confess to God."
G-Romans{_}407{_}12 So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.
G-Romans{_}408{_}13 Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore,  but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our  brother's way.
G-Romans{_}409{_}14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing  is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for  him it is unclean.
G-Romans{_}410{_}15 If your brother is distressed because of what you eat,  you are no longer walking in love.
G-Romans{_}411{_}Do not by your eating destroy the one  for whom Christ died.
G-Romans{_}412{_}16 So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.
G-Romans{_}413{_}17  For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and  peace and joy in the Holy Spirit; 18 he who serves Christ in this way is  acceptable to God and approved by men.
G-Romans{_}414{_}19 Let us therefore pursue what  makes for peace and for mutual edification.
G-Romans{_}415{_}20 Do not, for the sake of  food, destroy the work of God.
G-Romans{_}416{_}Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong  for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
G-Romans{_}417{_}21 It is  right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother  stumble.
G-Romans{_}418{_}22 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God.
G-Romans{_}419{_}Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves.
G-Romans{_}420{_}23 But  he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from  faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.
G-Romans{_}421{_}15 	1 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak,  and not to please ourselves.
G-Romans{_}422{_}2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his  good, to build him up.
G-Romans{_}423{_}3 For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it  is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."
G-Romans{_}424{_}4  For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction,  that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we  might have hope.
G-Romans{_}425{_}5 May the God of patience and encouragement grant  you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus, 6 that  you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our  Lord Jesus Christ.
G-Romans{_}426{_}7 Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ also welcomed  you, to the glory of God.
G-Romans{_}427{_}8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant  of the circumcised to show God's truth, to confirm the promises made to  the patriarchs, 9 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his  mercy.
G-Romans{_}428{_}As it is written:  	"Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,  		and sing to your name";  10 and again it says:  	"Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people!"
G-Romans{_}429{_}11 and again,  	"Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,  		and praise him, all you peoples";  12 And again, Isaiah says:  	"There shall be a root of Jesse;  		and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles,  	in him the Gentiles shall hope."
G-Romans{_}430{_}13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so  that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
G-Romans{_}431{_}14 I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you  yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to  instruct one another.
G-Romans{_}432{_}15 But I have written very boldly to you on some  points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me  from God, 16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the  priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles  might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
G-Romans{_}433{_}17 Therefore I have  reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
G-Romans{_}434{_}18 For I will not  venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished  through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed19 by  the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from  Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of  Christ.
G-Romans{_}435{_}20 And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not  where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's  foundation, 21 but as it is written:  	"They shall see who have not been told of him,  		and those who have not heard shall understand."
G-Romans{_}436{_}22 This is the reason why I have often been hindered from  coming to you.
G-Romans{_}437{_}23 But now, since I no longer have any place for work in  these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, 24 I  plan to do so when I go to Spain.
G-Romans{_}438{_}I hope to see you while passing through,  and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your  company for a while.
G-Romans{_}439{_}25 Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid  for the saints.
G-Romans{_}440{_}26 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a  contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
G-Romans{_}441{_}27 They were  pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them.
G-Romans{_}442{_}For if the Gentiles  have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of  service to them in material blessings.
G-Romans{_}443{_}28 When therefore I have completed  this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to  Spain.
G-Romans{_}444{_}29 And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the  fullness of the blessing of Christ.
G-Romans{_}445{_}30 Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by  the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for  me, 31 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my  service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 32 so that by God's  will I may come to you with joy, and together with you be refreshed.
G-Romans{_}446{_}33  The God of peace be with you all.
G-Romans{_}447{_}Amen.
G-Romans{_}448{_}16 	1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the  church in Cenchrea, 2 that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner  worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she has need from you, for  she has been a helper of many and of myself also.
G-Romans{_}449{_}3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,  4 who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I but also all the  churches of the Gentiles give thanks; 5 greet also the church that meets in  their house.
G-Romans{_}450{_}Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert of  Asia for Christ.
G-Romans{_}451{_}6 Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.
G-Romans{_}452{_}7 Greet  Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners; they are  men of note among the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.
G-Romans{_}453{_}8  Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
G-Romans{_}454{_}9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow  worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
G-Romans{_}455{_}10 Greet Apelles, who is  approved in Christ.
G-Romans{_}456{_}Greet those who belong to the household of  Aristobulus.
G-Romans{_}457{_}11 Greet Herodion, my kinsman.
G-Romans{_}458{_}Greet those in the  household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
G-Romans{_}459{_}12 Greet Tryphena and  Tryphosa, those workers in the Lord.
G-Romans{_}460{_}Greet the beloved Persis, who has  worked hard in the Lord.
G-Romans{_}461{_}13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his  mother and mine.
G-Romans{_}462{_}14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas,  Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.
G-Romans{_}463{_}15 Greet Philologus and  Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with  them.
G-Romans{_}464{_}16 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
G-Romans{_}465{_}All the churches of Christ  greet you.
G-Romans{_}466{_}17 I urge you, brethren, to take note of those who cause  divisions and difficulties, contrary to the doctrine which you have  learned; avoid them.
G-Romans{_}467{_}18 For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ,  but their own appetites, and by smooth and flattering words they deceive  the hearts of the simple.
G-Romans{_}468{_}19 For your obedience has become known to all,  so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good,  and innocent about what is evil.
G-Romans{_}469{_}20 And the God of peace will soon crush  Satan under your feet.
G-Romans{_}470{_}The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
G-Romans{_}471{_}21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, and  Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
G-Romans{_}472{_}22 I, Tertius, who wrote this letter,  greet you in the Lord.
G-Romans{_}473{_}23 Gaius, who is my host and the host of the whole  church, greets you.
G-Romans{_}474{_}Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and  Quartus, our brother.
G-Romans{_}475{_}25 Now to him who is able to establish you according to my  gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of  the mystery which was kept secret for long ages 26 but is now revealed  and made known to all nations through the prophetic writings, according  to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of  faith27 to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ!
G-Romans{_}476{_}Amen.
