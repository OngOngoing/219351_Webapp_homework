10019{_}100{_}CHAPTER XV.
10019{_}101{_}"SPOTTED."
10019{_}102{_}When the bell of St. Cow's began ringing for Ritualistic morning-service, with a sound as of some incontinently rambling dun spinster of the lacteal herd--now near at hand in cracked dissonance, as the wind blows hither; now afar, in tinkling distance, as the wind blows hence--MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON was several miles away from Bumsteadville upon his walking-match, with head already bumped like a pineapple, and face curiously swelled, from amateur practice with the Indian Club.
10019{_}103{_}Being by that time cold enough for breakfast, and willing to try the virtues of some soothing application to his right eye, which, from a bruise just below it, was nearly closed, the badly banged young man suspended his murderous calisthenics at the door of a rustic hotel, and there entered to secure a wayside meal.
10019{_}104{_}The American country "hotel," or half-way house, is, perhaps, one of the most depressing fictions ever encountered by stage-passenger, or pedestrian afield: and depends so exclusively upon the imagination for any earthly distinction from the retired and neglected private hiding-place of some decayed and morbid agricultural family, that only the conventional swing sign-board before the door saves the cognizant mind from a painfully dense confusion.
10019{_}105{_}Smelling about equally of eternal wash-day, casual cow-shed, and passing feather-bed, it sustains a lank, middle-aged, gristly man to come out at the same hour every day and grunt unintelligibly at the stage-driver, an expressionless boy in a bandless straw-hat and no shoes to stare blankly from the doorway at the same old pole-horse he has mechanically thus inspected from infancy, and one speckled hen of mature years to poise observingly on single leg at the head of the shapeless black dog asleep at the sunny end of the low wooden stoop.
10019{_}106{_}It is the one rural spot on earth where a call for fresh eggs evokes remonstrative and chronic denial; where chickens for dinner are sternly discredited as mere freaks of legendary romance, and an order for a glass of new milk is incredulously answered by a tumblerful of water which tastes of whitewash-brush.
10019{_}107{_}Whosoever sleeps there of a night shall be crowded by walls which rub off into a faint feather-bed of the flavor and consistency of geese used whole, and have for his feverish breakfast in the morning a version of broiled ham as racy of attic-salt as the rasher of BACON'S essays.
10019{_}108{_}And to him who pays his bill there, ere he straggles weakly forth to repair his shattered health by frenzied flight, shall be given in change such hoary ten-cent shreds of former postal currency as he has not hitherto deemed credible, sticking together in inextricable conglomeration by such fragments of fish-scales as he never before believed could be gathered by handled small-money from palms not sufficiently washed after piscatorial diversion.
10019{_}109{_}It was in at a country hotel, then, that the young Southern pedestrian turned for temporary rest and a meal, and pitiless was the cross-examination instituted by the inevitable lank, middle-aged gristly man, before he could reconcile it with his duty as a cautious public character to reveal the treasures of the larder.
10019{_}110{_}Those bumps on the head, that swollen eye, and nose, came--did they?--from swinging this here club for exercise.
10019{_}111{_}Well, he wanted to know, now!
10019{_}112{_}People generally used two of the clubs at once--did they?--but one was enough for a beginner.
10019{_}113{_}Well, he _wanted_ to know, now!
10019{_}114{_}Could he supply a couple of poached eggs and a cup of milk?
10019{_}115{_}No, young man; but a slice of corned pork and a bowl of tea were within the resources of the establishment.
10019{_}116{_}When at length upon the road again, the bruised youth resolved to follow a cattle-track "across lots," for the greater space in which to exercise with his Indian club as he walked.
10019{_}117{_}Like any other novice in the practice, he could not divest his mind of the impression, that the frightful thumps he continually received, in twirling the merciless thing around and behind his devoted head, were due to some kind of crowding influence from the boundaries on either side the way, and it was to gain relief from such damaging contraction of area that he left the highway for the wider wintry fields.
10019{_}118{_}Going onward in these latter at an irregular pace; sometimes momentarily stunned into a rangy stagger by a sounding blow on the cerebrum or the cerebellum; and, again, irritated almost to a run by contusion of shoulder-blade or funny-bone; he finally became aware that two men were following him through the lots, and that with a closeness of attention indicating more than common interest.
10019{_}119{_}To the perception of his keenly sensitive Southern nature they at once became ribald Yankee vandals, hoping for unseemly amusement from the detection of some awkwardness in the Indian-club-play of a defeated but not conquered Southern Gentleman; and, in the haughty sectional pride of his contemptuous soul, he indignantly determined to show not the least consciousness of their disrespectful observation.
10019{_}120{_}Twirling the club around and around his battered head with increasing velocity, he smiled scornfully to himself, nor deigned a single backward glance at the one of his two followers who approached more rapidly than the other.
10019{_}121{_}He heard the hindermost say to the foremost, "Leave him alone, I tell you, and he'll knock himself down in a minute," and, in a passionately reckless effort of sheer bravado to catch the club from one hand with the other while it yet circled swiftly over his skull, he accidentally brought the ungovernable weapon into tremendous contact with the top of his head, and dashed himself violently to the earth.
10019{_}122{_}"Didn't I tell you he'd do it?"
10019{_}123{_}cried the hindermost of the two strangers, coming up; while the other coolly seated himself upon the prostrated victim.
10019{_}124{_}"These here Indian clubs always throw a man if he ain't got muscle in his arms; and this here little Chivalry has got arms like a couple of canes."
10019{_}125{_}"Arise from me instantly, fellow.
10019{_}126{_}You're sitting upon my breast-pin," exclaimed MONTGOMERY to the person sitting upon him.
10019{_}127{_}They suffered him to regain his feet, which he did with extreme hauteur, and surveyed his bumped head and swollen countenance with undisguised wonder.
10019{_}128{_}"How dare you treat a Southerner in this way?"
10019{_}129{_}continued the young man, his head aching inexpressibly.
10019{_}130{_}"I thought the war was over long ago.
10019{_}131{_}If money is your object, seek out a citizen of some other section than mine; for the South is out of funds just now, owing to the military outrages of Northern scorpions."
10019{_}132{_}"We're constables, Mr. PENDRAGON," was the reply, "and it is our duty to take you back to the main road, where a couple of your friends are waiting for you."
10019{_}133{_}Staring from one to the other in speechless wonder at what this fresh outrage upon the down-trodden South could mean, MONTGOMERY allowed them to replace his Indian club in his hand, and conduct him back to the public road; where, to his increased bewilderment, he found Gospeler SIMPSON and the Ritualistic organist.
10019{_}134{_}"What is the matter, gentlemen?"
10019{_}135{_}he asked, in great agitation: "must I take the oath of Loyalty; or am I required by Yankee philanthropy to marry a negress?"
10019{_}136{_}At the sound of his voice, Mr. BUMSTEAD left the shoulder of Mr. SIMPSON, upon which he had been leaning with great weight, and, coming forward in three long skips, deliberately wound his right hand in the speaker's neck-tie.
10019{_}137{_}"Where are those nephews--where's that umbrella?"
10019{_}138{_}demanded the organist, with considerable ferocity.
10019{_}139{_}"Nephews!--umbrella!"
10019{_}140{_}gasped the other.
10019{_}141{_}"The EDWINS--bone handle," explained Mr. BUMSTEAD, lurching towards his captive.
10019{_}142{_}"Mr. MONTGOMERY," interposed the Gospeler, sadly, Mr. DROOD went out with you last night, late, from his estimable uncle's lodgings, and has not been seen since.
10019{_}143{_}Where is he?"
10019{_}144{_}"He went back into the house again, sir, after I had walked him up and down the road a few times."
10019{_}145{_}"Well, then, where's that umbrella?"
10019{_}146{_}roared the organist, who seemed quite beside himself with grief and excitement.
10019{_}147{_}"Mr. BUMSTEAD, pray be more calm," implored the Reverend OCTAVIUS.
10019{_}148{_}"Mr. MONTGOMERY, this agitated gentleman's nephew has been mysteriously missing ever since he went out with you at midnight: also an alpaca umbrella."
10019{_}149{_}"Upon my honor, I know nothing of either," ejaculated the unhappy Southerner.
10019{_}150{_}Mr. BUMSTEAD, still holding him by the neck-tie, cast a fiery and unsettled glance around at nothing in particular; then ground his teeth audibly, and scowled.
10019{_}151{_}"My boy's missing!"
10019{_}152{_}he said, hissingly.--"Y'understand?--he's missing.--I must insist upon searching the prisoner."
10019{_}153{_}In the presence of Gospeler and constables, and loftily regardless alike of their startled wonder and the young man's protests, the maddened uncle of the lost DROOD deliberately examined all the captive's pockets in succession.
10019{_}154{_}In one of them was a penknife, which, after thoughtfully trying it upon his pink nails, he abstractedly placed in his own pocket.
10019{_}155{_}Searching next the overwhelmed Southerner's travelling-satchel, he found in it an apple, which he first eyed with marked suspicion, and then bit largely into, as though half expecting to find in it some traces of his nephew.
10019{_}156{_}"I'll keep this suspicious fruit," he remarked, with a hollow laugh; and, bearing unreservedly upon the nearer arm of the hapless MONTGOMERY, and eating audibly as he surged onward, he started on the return march for Bumsteadville.
10019{_}157{_}Not a word more was spoken until, after a cool Christmas stroll of about eight and a quarter miles, the whole party stood before Judge SWEENEY in the house of the latter.
10019{_}158{_}There, when the story had been sorrowfully repeated by the Gospeler, Mr. BUMSTEAD exhibited the core of the apple, and tickled the magistrate almost into hysterics by whispering very closely in his ear, that it was a core curiously similar to that of the last apple eaten by his nephew; and, having been found in an apple from the prisoner's satchel, might be useful in evidence.
10019{_}159{_}Judge SWEENEY wished to know if Mr. PENDRAGON had any political relations, or could influence any votes?
10019{_}160{_}and, upon being answered in the negative, eyed the young man sternly, and said that appearances were decidedly against him.
10019{_}161{_}He could not exactly commit him to jail without accusation, although the apple-core and his political unimportance subjected him to grave suspicion: but he should hold the Gospeler responsible for the youth's appearance at any time when his presence should be required.
10019{_}162{_}Mr. BUMSTEAD, whose eyes were becoming very glassy, then suggested that a handbill should be at once printed and circulated, to the effect that there had been Lost, or Stolen, two Black Alpaca Nephews, about 5 feet 8 inches high, with a bone handle, light eyes and hair, and whalebone ribs; and that if the said EDWIN would return, with a brass ferule slightly worn, the finder should receive earnest thanks, and be seen safely to his home by J. BUMSTEAD.
10019{_}163{_}Mr. Gospeler SIMPSON and Judge SWEENEY agreed that a handbill should be issued: but thought it might confuse the public mind if the missing nephew and the lost umbrella were not kept separate.
10019{_}164{_}"Has either 'f you gen'l'men ever been 'n Uncle?"
10019{_}165{_}asked the Ritualistic organist, with dark intensity.
10019{_}166{_}They shook their heads.
10019{_}167{_}"_Then,_" said Mr. BUMSTEAD, with great force,--"THEN, gen'l'men, you-knownor-wahritis-to-lose-'n-umbrella!"
10019{_}168{_}Before they could decide in their weaker minds what the immediate connection was, he had left them, at a sharp slant, in great intellectual disturbance, and was passing out through the entry-way with both his hands against the wall.
10019{_}169{_}Early next morning, while young Mr. PENDRAGON was locked in his room, startled and wretched, the inconsolable uncle of EDWIN DROOD was energetically ransacking every part of Bumsteadville for the missing man.
10019{_}170{_}House after house he visited, like some unholy inspector: peering up chimneys, prodding under carpets, and staying a long time in cellars where there was cider.
10019{_}171{_}Not a bit of paper or cloth blew along the turnpike but he eagerly picked it up, searched in it with the most anxious care, and finally placed it in his hat.
10019{_}172{_}Going to the Pond, with a borrowed hatchet, he cut a bole in the thick ice, lost the hatchet, and, after bathing his head in the water, declared that his alpaca nephew was not there.
10019{_}173{_}Finding an antique flask in one of his pockets, he gradually removed all the liquid contents therefrom with a tubular straw, but still could discern no traces of EDWIN DROOD.
10019{_}174{_}All the live-long day he prosecuted his researches, to the great discomposure of the populace: and, with whitewash all over the back of his coat, and very dingy hands, had just seated himself at his own fireside in the evening, when Mr. DIBBLE came in.
10019{_}175{_}"This is a strange disappearance," said Mr. DIBBLE.
10019{_}176{_}"And it was good as new," groaned the organist, with but one eye open.
10019{_}177{_}"Almost new!--_what_ was?"
10019{_}178{_}"Th'umbrella."
10019{_}179{_}"Mr. BUMSTEAD," returned the old man, coldly, "I am not talking of an umbrella, but of Mr.
10019{_}180{_}EDWIN."
10019{_}181{_}"Yesh, I know," said the uncle.
10019{_}182{_}"Awright.
10019{_}183{_}I'm li'lle sleepy; tha'sall."
10019{_}184{_}"I've just seen my ward, Mr.
10019{_}185{_}BUMSTEAD."
10019{_}186{_}"'She puerwell, shir?"
10019{_}187{_}"She is _not_ pretty well.
10019{_}188{_}Nor is Miss PENDRAGON."
10019{_}189{_}"I'm vahr' sorry," said Mr. BUMSTEAD, just audibly.
10019{_}190{_}"Miss PENDRAGON scorns the thought of any blame for her brother," continued Mr. DIBBLE, eyeing the fire.
10019{_}191{_}"It had a bun-bone handle," muttered the other, dreamily.
10019{_}192{_}Then, with a momentary brightening--"'scuse me, shir: whah'll y'take?"
10019{_}193{_}"Nothing, sir!"
10019{_}194{_}was the sharp response.
10019{_}195{_}"I'm not at all thirsty.
10019{_}196{_}But there is something more to tell you.
10019{_}197{_}At the last meeting of my ward and your nephew--just before your dinner here,--they concluded to break their engagement of marriage, for certain good reasons, and thenceforth be only brother and sister to each other."
10019{_}198{_}Starting forward in his chair, with partially opened eyes, the white-washed and dingy Mr. BUMSTEAD managed to get off his hat, covering himself with a bandanna handkerchief and innumerable old pieces of paper and cloth, as he did so, from head to foot; made a feeble effort to throw it at the aged lawyer; and then, chair and all, tumbled forward with a crash to the rug, where he lay in a refreshing sleep.

10019{_}200{_}A QUAKER friend of mine once observed that he loved the Ocean for its Broad Brim.
10019{_}201{_}So do I, but not for that alone.
10019{_}202{_}I am partial to it on account of the somewhat extensive facilities it affords for Sea Bathing.
10019{_}203{_}Learning to swim, by the way, was my principal Elementary study.
10019{_}204{_}I have just returned from taking a plunge in company with many other distinguished persons.
10019{_}205{_}How it cools one to rush into the "Boiling Surf."
10019{_}206{_}How refreshing to dive Below the Billow.
10019{_}207{_}I don't think I could ever have a Surfeit of the Surf, I am so fond of it.
10019{_}208{_}Oh!
10019{_}209{_}the Sea!
10019{_}210{_}the Sea!
10019{_}211{_}with its darkly, deeply cerulean--but stop!
10019{_}212{_}I am getting out of my depth.
10019{_}213{_}Would that I were a poet, that I--But I ain't, so what's the use?
10019{_}214{_}As I sat on the verandah of the ------ Hotel the other morning, gazing on the broad expanse of Ocean and wiping the perspiration which trickled from my lofty brow, (the thermometer marked 90 degrees,) I could not help recalling the beautifully appropriate lines of the celebrated bard:      "When the sun's perpendicular rays       Begin to illumine the Sea,     The fishies exclaim in amaze       'Confound it!
10019{_}215{_}how hot it will be!'"
10019{_}216{_}What a pity that the Bathing here has a drawback.
10019{_}217{_}I refer, of course, to the Under Tow, which has caused some Untoward accidents.
10019{_}218{_}Those who have experienced it, say it is impossible to keep your Feet when caught by the Under Tow.
10019{_}219{_}Presence of mind is indispensable in such a case, but, unfortunately, timid swimmers are too apt to lose their Heads as well as their feet.
10019{_}220{_}Some of the lady visitors are Beautiful Swimmers, and their Divers Charms excite universal admiration.
10019{_}221{_}Many of these fair Amphitrites are so constantly in or on the water that it would hardly be a Fib to call them Amphibious.
10019{_}222{_}Their husbands and brothers are, I regret to say, not so much On the Water, preferring something a trifle stronger semi-occasionally, if not oftener.
10019{_}223{_}You know what a popular amusement crabbing is here.
10019{_}224{_}I seldom indulge in it myself, as I have bad luck, which makes me Crabbed.
10019{_}225{_}Our "distinguished guests," as JENKINS would say, are very numerous, and it is truly an edifying sight to see judges, legislators, eminent politicians, and other "Heads of the People" bobbing about in the water together.
10019{_}226{_}Some folks don't seem to care what they spend when they come here, and no sooner arrive at the Branch than they Branch out into all sorts of extravagance.
10019{_}227{_}There is some superb horseflesh here just now, and the fastest nags may be seen doing their Level best on the Smooth Beach.
10019{_}228{_}The Race Track, Grand Stand, &c., are all that the vivid fancy of a PUNCHINELLO can paint them.
10019{_}229{_}The bathing costumes!
10019{_}230{_}who can do justice to them and their lovely wearers?
10019{_}231{_}Some time ago, (as I am informed,) a lady made her appearance on the beach as a Nereid.
10019{_}232{_}Did you Ne'er read of the Nereids, Mr. PUNCHINELLO?
10019{_}233{_}If you have, you are aware that they were the Sea Nymphs of the Ancients, in other words the Old Maids of the Sea, who never got married, and frequently played Scaly tricks on Mariners.
10019{_}234{_}The Nereid referred to was arrayed in pea green and spangles, with green tresses, which is very well known to be the correct costume of a mermaid of antiquity, copied from the latest Paris fashions.
10019{_}235{_}This Spritely lady was, however, unprovided with a tail, which was Unmermaidenlike in the Extreme.
10019{_}236{_}You know how brilliant the Hops are, so I will Skip them.
10019{_}237{_}One thing, however, is worth noting.
10019{_}238{_}At some of the Hotels they have a Spread on the carpet before the dancing begins, as well as a supper afterwards.
10019{_}239{_}The excellent music of the Hotel bands is Instrumental in drawing crowds of listeners to the Ball rooms.
10019{_}240{_}Some Chinese Jugglers gave an entertainment here the other evening, but I didn't go, not being in the Juggler Vein.
10019{_}241{_}Yours Reverentially,  CHINCAPIN.

10019{_}248{_}Little JACK HORNER     Sat in a corner.
10019{_}249{_}Eating a Christmas Pie:     He put in his thumb     And pulled out a plum,       And said, "What a brave boy am I."
10019{_}250{_}In Canto I, I have shown the varied emotions which seized the tender soul of Old Mother HUBBARD'S Dog.
10019{_}251{_}Emotions so fierce in their sorrow, that they left not a single wiggle in his tail: his hopes were crushed, his expectations ruined.
10019{_}252{_}In Canto II I have pictured the musical propensities of the genus _Cat_, the wandering vagaries of the moon-dane cow, the purp's withering contempt thereat, and the frisky evolutions of the dish which rolled off on its ear.
10019{_}253{_}In Canto III I have portrayed the "tender passion" and its melancholy result on the hill-side--a fitting illustration of the fact that the course of true love never did run smooth, especially if there were big rocks to knock one's toes against.
10019{_}254{_}And now, in Canto IV, I am about to portray childish innocence in the pursuit of bliss.
10019{_}255{_}All things are graded, with the trifling exception of many of our streets.
10019{_}256{_}But who cares about this grade of bliss?
10019{_}257{_}I don't, and I am sure the poet didn't when he sang the lines at the head of this chapter.
10019{_}258{_}Bliss is graded.
10019{_}259{_}The old man in Wall street, with white hair and white necktie, and smooth polished tongue, has his degree of bliss when he is engaged in throwing stones at the Apes in the tree-top, that they may return the throw with gold cocoa-nuts.
10019{_}260{_}The young lady has her degree of bliss when her waist is entwined by "Dear CHAWLES," who soothes her troubled spirit with the tender melody of "Red as a beet is she,"--alluding to her would-be rival.
10019{_}261{_}The nice young man has his degree of bliss when he chews a tooth-pick--poor goose!
10019{_}262{_}(not the nice young man, but the fowl which gave the quill,)--and is given a smile by a dark-eyed female in a passing stage.
10019{_}263{_}And Infantdom has--But our poet beautifully illustrates this in the stanzas we have quoted.
10019{_}264{_}"Little JACK HORNER,"  says he, with the easy grace of one perfectly familiar with the subject he is to treat; neither frightened at its immensity, nor putting himself in the way of a dilemma by stopping to examine details.
10019{_}265{_}Little JACK was the poet's pet because he was the afflicted one of the household, and poets know full well how to sympathize with affliction.
10019{_}266{_}Perhaps JACK sat down to dinner next to cross-eyed SUSAN ANN, "by Brother BILL'S gal," and perhaps JACK'S nose was tickled by a little blue-bottle, and that he sneezed right into her soup-plate; and then he was hurried from the table for blowing a fly into SUSAN ANN'S soup!
10019{_}267{_}He would lose his dinner.
10019{_}268{_}His napkin would miss its accustomed wash!
10019{_}269{_}"Shall it be thus?
10019{_}270{_}No!"
10019{_}271{_}says the poet.
10019{_}272{_}"Dry your tears, little JACK, go to the well-stocked pantry, my boy, and get something to eat.
10019{_}273{_}The jury will not convict you of stealing, for their verdict will be that you did the deed in self-defence."
10019{_}274{_}And he did--go to the closet, and--      "Sat in the corner,     Eating a Christmas Pie."
10019{_}275{_}See the smiles as they wreathe themselves on his chubby countenance.
10019{_}276{_}How little JACK looks at the pie!
10019{_}277{_}how he turns it round and round to find the best spot whereon to begin the attack!
10019{_}278{_}How he smacks his lips, and thinks how nice it would be if he _could_ wish to give SUSAN ANN a taste!
10019{_}279{_}But he can't.
10019{_}280{_}Suddenly an idea strikes JACK.
10019{_}281{_}He has heard Uncle TOM talk of a big war between Frawnce and Proossia, and all about the soldiers and the cannon, and the big noises.
10019{_}282{_}Little JACK will make war on the pie.
10019{_}283{_}He will be Frawnce, the pie will be Proossia.
10019{_}284{_}He sets it squarely before him on the floor; rolls up his sleeves, may be; his eyes sparkle with determination; he finds the most vulnerable spot in the crust; he makes one bold dive with his thumb, it goes down, down down, crushing everything before it; it feels something; renewed vigor flows through JACK'S veins, and gives him new strength for the attack; victory crowns him; and, in the words of the poet,      "He pulled out a plum,     And said, 'What a brave boy am I.'"
10019{_}285{_}--Now he is happy.
10019{_}286{_}He has realized his fondest hopes.
10019{_}287{_}The blue-bottle has no tickle for him now.
10019{_}288{_}He was Frawnce and he has licked Proossia.
10019{_}289{_}There is nothing left but the plate, and his teeth are not hard enough for that.

10019{_}303{_}For a youth of fourteen he is said to have gone through the trying ceremonies with great credit until directed by his mamma to dance with a venerable female of noble blood, just as he was about to lend a beautiful American miss through the mazes of a Schottische.
10019{_}304{_}The son of his father took one glance at the ancient dame, and one at the lovely creature beside him, and then set up a right royal blubber of disappointment.

10019{_}311{_}Punchinello's Vacations.
10019{_}312{_}It was hot when Mr. PUNCHINELLO started for Niagara.
10019{_}313{_}So hot that no allusions to Fahrenheit would give an idea of the tremendous preponderance of caloric in the atmosphere.
10019{_}314{_}The trip was full of discomforts, and there was great danger, at one time, that the train would arrive at Niagara with a load of desiccated bodies.
10019{_}315{_}Of course the water all boiled away in the engine-tanks, causing endless stoppages; and of course the hot sun, pouring directly upon the roof of the cars, caused the boards thereof to curl up and twist about in such fantastic fashion, that they afforded no protection whatever to the passengers, who were obliged to resort to sunshades and umbrellas, or get under the seats.
10019{_}316{_}Added to this were the facts that the ice-water in the coolers scalded the mouth; the brass-work on the seats blistered the hands; and the empty stoves, almost red-hot from their exposure to the sun, superheated the cars to a degree that was maddening.
10019{_}317{_}Added to these was the fact that the intense heat expanded the rails until they were several miles longer than usual, and thus the passengers suffered the tortures of the transit for an increased length of time.
10019{_}318{_}When, at last, Mr. P. was conveyed, in a stifling hack, (the fare had risen, under the unusual circumstances, about one hundred and ten degrees,) to a stifling little room under the hot roof of an hotel exposed to the sun on every side, and had taken an extempore Russian bath while changing his linen, and had partaken of a hot dinner, he might have been excused for saying that he would like to cool off a little.
10019{_}319{_}Inquiring if there was any stream of water convenient, he was directed to the river Niagara, which runs hard by the hotel.
10019{_}320{_}Reaching the banks of the river, Mr. P. was very much pleased by the prospect.
10019{_}321{_}There is a considerable depression in the bed of the stream at one point, and the water runs over the rocks quite rapidly, carrying with it such leaves, twigs, steamboats or other objects that may be floating upon its surface.
10019{_}322{_}Mr. P. immediately perceived the advantages of this condition of things to a a gentleman suffering from the heat, and procuring a boat, he rowed close to the foot of a cascade formed by the inclination in the bed of the river, and throwing out his anchor, revelled in the luxury of the cool spray and the refreshing sound of the rushing water.
10019{_}323{_}[Illustration]  Does not this look cool?
10019{_}324{_}When sufficiently refreshed, Mr. P. rowed to shore, feeling like another man.
10019{_}325{_}With the greatest confidence in its merits, he recommends his plan to those who may be suffering from the summer heat.
10019{_}326{_}After breakfast the next morning, Mr. P. set out to see what he could see.
10019{_}327{_}He did not engage the services of any hackman or professional guide.
10019{_}328{_}He had heard of their extortions, and determined to submit to nothing of the kind.
10019{_}329{_}He intended relying entirely upon himself.
10019{_}330{_}He walked some distance without meeting with any of the places of interest of which he had heard so much.
10019{_}331{_}Meeting at length with a respectable elderly gentleman, Mr. P. inquired of him the way to the Cave of the Winds.
10019{_}332{_}"The Cave of the Winds?
10019{_}333{_}Ah!"
10019{_}334{_}said this worthy person.
10019{_}335{_}"You turn to your left here, sir--ah!
10019{_}336{_}and then you keep on for about--ah!
10019{_}337{_}half a mile, and you will--ah!
10019{_}338{_}see a gate--ah!
10019{_}339{_}Behind that is a man and the cave--ah!"
10019{_}340{_}Mr. P. thanked him and was proceeding on his way, when the worthy citizen touched him on the arm, saying:  "Twenty-one dollars, if you please, sir."
10019{_}341{_}"Twenty-one dev----developments!"
10019{_}342{_}cried Mr. P; "Why, what do you mean?"
10019{_}343{_}"Information, sir; fifty cents a word; forty-two words; twenty-one dollars."
10019{_}344{_}It must not be supposed that Mr. P. submitted tamely to this outrage, but after a long dispute, it was agreed to refer the matter to the arbitration of three of the principal citizens.
10019{_}345{_}They promptly decided that the charge was just and must be paid, but, owing to Mr. P.'s earnest protestations, they agreed to throw out the "ahs," as being of doubtful value as information.
10019{_}346{_}The sum thus saved to Mr. P. exactly paid for drinks for the party.
10019{_}347{_}Mr. P. now very sensibly concluded that it was about time to leave, if his editors, his printers, and the employes in his pun-factory were to expect any pay that week, and so he set out for home in the evening, taking a shortcut by the way of Montreal.
10019{_}348{_}He thought that a day might be very profitably spent here, especially if he could fall in with any of the French-Canadians, of whose peculiarities he had heard so much.
10019{_}349{_}The study of human nature was always Mr. P.'s particular forte.
10019{_}350{_}On the morning of his arrival, Mr. P. met, in the dining-room of the hotel, a gentleman who was unmistakably a Frenchman, and being in Canada, was probably Canadian.
10019{_}351{_}As they were sitting together at the table, Mr. P., having mentally rubbed up his knowledge of the French language, addressed his companion thus:  "_Avez-vous le chapeau de mon frere?_"  The gentleman thus politely addressed, bowed, smiled, and after a little hesitation answered:  "_Non, Monsieur; mais jai le fromage de votre soeur._"  "_Eh bien_" said Mr. P., as he scratched his head for a moment.
10019{_}352{_}"_Otez vous vos souliers et vos bas?_"  The other answered promptly, "_Je n'ote ni les uns ni les autres._"  "_Votre pere,_" remarked Mr. P., "_a-t-il la chandelle de votre oncle?_"  His companion remained silent for a minute or two, and then he said:  "I forget the French of the answer to that, but I know the English of it; it is 'no, sir, but he has the apples-of-the-ground-of-sugar of my mother-in-law.'"
10019{_}353{_}When Mr. P. discovered, after a little conversation in the vernacular, that his companion was a New York dry-goods clerk, he gave up the study of the French-Canadian character and went on with his breakfast.
10019{_}354{_}When he went out into the streets to see the lions of the city he was delighted to meet with some old friends.
10019{_}355{_}In company with them he visited the Government House; the Cathedral; the Statue of NELSON; the VICTORIA bridge; and everything else of interest in the place.
10019{_}356{_}But nothing was so delightful to him as the faces of these old friends, from whom he had been separated so long.

10019{_}374{_}The sympathy exhibited by the _Sun_ reporters and editors for the unhappy victim of Ogre Tammany is particularly touching.
10019{_}375{_}Association with the Wickedest Man in New York, the Honorable JOHN ALLEN, _protege_ of the Reverend OLIVER DYER, has evidently demoralized the pure beings who control the immaculate sheet known as the _Sun_, whose putrescent light "shines for all."
10019{_}376{_}These panders to the depraved taste of a depraved portion of the community, may exult in the spectacle presented in the City of New York on Sunday, the 7th inst., but is it not a sorrowful thing in a so-called Christian land to see a murderer borne with triumph to his grave, while pseudo philanthropists deck his bier with flowers, and deliberately charge a great political party with having hunted the wretched man to his death?
10019{_}377{_}Was there no nobler game worth the killing by Tammany?
10019{_}378{_}Was there not a "stag of Ten" to be found, to be struck, if party necessities required it?
10019{_}379{_}Would OAKEY HALL and PETER B. SWEENY put such a slight upon these bastard allies of the O'BRIENS and MORRISSEYS whose columns are open to the highest bidder, and whose lips reek venom while their hands are ever ready to strike a victim in the back, as to pass them by while they were on the war-path?
10019{_}380{_}But hold--perhaps we have a clue to this singular conduct of the Tammany warriors.
10019{_}381{_}They may have foreseen how apt the sweet people are to confer immortality upon those whose death becomes them better than their life, and therefore wisely forebore to disturb those blissful with murderers and felons which seem to bind the Satellites of the _Sun_ and the denizens of the Tombs together.

10019{_}535{_}Mr. Punchinello: As the acknowledged redresser of American wrongs and the enemy of public nuisances, we beg your attention to a vice which seems to be upon the increase, and which grows in strength with what it feeds upon.
10019{_}536{_}As the vice in question appears to be upon the increase, and to fascinate its victims by the allurements of the excitement, we consider it worthy of PUNCHINELLO'S lance, or, in other words, of being transfixed upon PUNCHINELLO'S quill.
10019{_}537{_}We refer to the loafing which invariably takes place upon the occasion of the relaying of the wooden pavement.
10019{_}538{_}I say wooden more particularly, inasmuch as new fangled varieties of pavement, such as Concrete, Nicholson, etc., although they have their day, cannot be said to compete for a moment in public regard with the good old fashioned kind first described.
10019{_}539{_}Of all the causes that arrest public attention, surely this laying of wooden pavement is the most enduring and effectual.
10019{_}540{_}People of every grade and degree make a dead halt as they approach this centre of interest, and at once settle down for a prolonged inspection of the works before them.
10019{_}541{_}It is true that everybody has seen the same thing one hundred and fifty times, but this description of indulgence appears to grow by what it feeds upon, and the fascinated victim watches the operation of the workers with a gratification which knows no abatement.
10019{_}542{_}The usual formula gone through upon these occasions is as follows:  Citizen approaches the scene of interest, and sees crowds of spectators upon each side; he glances at the workmen, and, after taking stock of both them and the overseer, proceeds to read the opinion of his fellows in their faces, after which he settles down in right earnest with his hands in his pockets for a prolonged stare.
10019{_}543{_}This latter may continue for periods varying from ten minutes to an hour and three quarters, according to inclination or opportunity.
10019{_}544{_}If the spectator is a man of business, it is just possible that he may content himself with measuring the size of the blocks with his eye, and then pass on, content to know that he, as one out of many taxpayers, is getting the value of what they are called on to pay for.
10019{_}545{_}But with the mass of the onlookers, the pouring of the hot pitch into the gravelled interstices is watched with a satisfaction ever new, like that bestowed in the pantomime upon the application by the clown of the red-hot poker.
10019{_}546{_}There is also the pleasure of seeing others at hard work, and the indulgence of everybody's belief (which is common to all present,) that he or she could suggest an improvement upon the work proceeding, and the manner of doing it.
10019{_}547{_}Then they look at each other once more and depart contented.
10019{_}548{_}Upon a moderate calculation, the amount of time devoted by human beings to this amusing study, in the City of New York, amounts to 2,450,000 hours per annum.

10019{_}552{_}People have been looking at England with much curiosity to see what she really does intend.
10019{_}553{_}With the facilities which our _special wire_ affords, I am enabled to report a highly interesting soliloquy delivered by the Rt.
10019{_}554{_}Hon.
10019{_}555{_}W. E. GLADSTONE, to his bed-post, at his home in Spring Gardens, London, after a hot night's debate at St. STEPHEN'S.
10019{_}556{_}Our reporter concealed himself in the key-hole and took _verbatim_ notes.
10019{_}557{_}As in the case of the speeches delivered by the rival monarchs to their armies, which you published a week in advance of the speeches themselves, the following can be relied on:  "I'm tired of answering questions.
10019{_}558{_}Let me think awhile.
10019{_}559{_}Is war the only alternative?
10019{_}560{_}They blame me for not talking out.

10019{_}564{_}nothing cheerful that side.
10019{_}565{_}"France can rock _her_ irreconcilables to sleep to the war lullaby of that man we have so trusted only to betray us; _our_ irreconcilables only wait for war to side with our enemy.
10019{_}566{_}Prussia, grasping bull-dog as she is, makes capital out of it, and calls us to her side, while our stupid people burn with a Prussian fever, which may turn to a plague to-morrow.
10019{_}567{_}"Is the Prussian whom we have helped to humble to be our only ally?
10019{_}568{_}Then must we write ourselves down asses in Constantinople.
10019{_}569{_}"If we had some other head besides weather-cock expediency.
10019{_}570{_}France has an Emperor, Prussia a King to lead them; we have a Queen who takes walks in the Isle of Wight; and her son--bah!

10019{_}576{_}They are too much afraid of the German vote, thank Heaven, to side with France, but "Alabama" is her watchword, and she only waits to strangle us.
10019{_}577{_}LAFAYETTE and the Hessians are only memories, they have no votes.
10019{_}578{_}Ah!
10019{_}579{_}it was a mistake to sympathize with the South.
10019{_}580{_}"Our statesmen--Heaven save the mark!--are our worst enemies.

10019{_}584{_}We may sign treaties, but we cannot write them.

10019{_}598{_}The great West has long been famous for the loose, untrammelled freedom with which its inhabitants treat everything and everybody.
10019{_}599{_}Breadth, no less than length, is a striking feature of Western settlements, and that this element is conspicuous in the journalism of those singular abodes, no less than in the social life of their inhabitants, generally, is evidenced in the following advertisement cut from "_The Times_"--a paper published at Leavenworth, Kansas:  "NOTICE TO DRIVERS OF FAST STOCK.--Hold your horses and do not drive so fast.
10019{_}600{_}All gay and festive cusses caught driving faster than ordinary gait in the city, will be brought before Judge Vaughan, for instance--the fine is $20.
10019{_}601{_}H. A. ROBERTSON, City Marshal."
10019{_}602{_}The City Marshal of Leavenworth is clearly a pot-companion of the first (whiskey and) water.
10019{_}603{_}He declines to address his fellow-citizens in the commonplace terms usually recognised in more prosaic communities.
10019{_}604{_}To adopt his own style of phraseology, ROBERTSON is clearly a "gay and festive cuss."
10019{_}605{_}He is a specimen brick from Kansas, and doubtless always carries one in his hat.
10019{_}606{_}The expression "ordinary gait," as applied to driving in Kansas, where everybody owns "fast stock," is rather equivocal in these quieter latitudes to be sure, but we may guess that, at Leavenworth, a man who rides or drives at a pace of twenty miles an hour, is liable, "for instance," to a fine of $20, or just one dollar per mile.
10019{_}607{_}Kansas maybe a very nice place to live in, for some people, but we would hardly recommend Mr. ROBERT BONNER to emigrate thither, and so risk the probability of being advertised as a "gay and festive cuss."

10019{_}609{_}Of all public performers, there are none who "draw" better than the gymnasts who risk their necks by attempting hazardous feats.
10019{_}610{_}The fool who attaches himself by the heels to the car of an ascending balloon is sure to have thousands of feeble-minded females waving handkerchiefs at him.
10019{_}611{_}BLONDIN, the great French tomfool, brought more people to Niagara Falls to see him, possibly, add a new Fall to the prospect, than ever the Falls themselves did.
10019{_}612{_}And when another donkey announces that he is going to stand upon his head on the point of a church spire, that church is sure to be thronged--outside.
10019{_}613{_}These performances, and all of their sort, should be made punishable, and will probably be so when a hundred or two performers shall have been killed, in addition to those who have already suffered.
10019{_}614{_}Not nearly so exciting as performances of the kind referred to, though, perhaps, quite as rash, are the ocean voyages occasionally essayed by tiny, toy ships.

10019{_}665{_}CHAPTER I.
10019{_}666{_}In a room in a palatial tenement house in Avenue D, stood GILBERT FERNANDE FROU FROU SNOGGS.
10019{_}667{_}G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}668{_}was rampant.
10019{_}669{_}"Why?"
10019{_}670{_}you say.
10019{_}671{_}Gentle reader, hurry me not.
10019{_}672{_}Let the tale wag on.
10019{_}673{_}She was talking to her mamma.
10019{_}674{_}"Now," said G.F.F.F.S., "I prognosticated that my maternal relative would become oblivions of my reiterated solicitations to perambulate the Avenue, and make the acquisition of four yards of cerulean hued ribbon," and she stamped her tiny number eights on the floor.
10019{_}675{_}You will notice that, even in her anger, she did not forget her English.
10019{_}676{_}"You can purchase it on the morrow," replied her mamma.
10019{_}677{_}"I will not remain acquiescent.
10019{_}678{_}I will promenade upon my profluence to Sixth Avenue, and purchase the ceruleous ribbon immediately," said G.F.F.F.S., putting on her waterproof and sun-bonnet.
10019{_}679{_}Her mother pointed to the paternal turnip, which hung over the mantel, and showed her that old Time was "doing stunts" at 10-1/2.
10019{_}680{_}But G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}681{_}was obstinate.
10019{_}682{_}She put on her chignon, her curls, her breast elevator, her bustle, her high-heeled shoes, a little rouge, a little whiting and a bit of court-plaster, and sallied forth, down the dumb-waiter to the cellar, and thence, through the ash-hole, to the street.
10019{_}683{_}CHAPTER II.
10019{_}684{_}The deed was done!!!
10019{_}685{_}The purchase was made find G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}686{_}walked towards her palatial paternal mansion.
10019{_}687{_}She felt slightly timid, for, as she looked at the heavens, she saw that ARCTURUS, who had been playing tag with CASTOR and POLLUX all the evening, had reached hunk, the Great Bear.
10019{_}688{_}From the astronomical knowledge which she had acquired at the Vavasour Female Academy, she knew that the paternal turnip now pointed to the witching hour of 11-1/2.
10019{_}689{_}Suddenly she found herself surrounded by a party of bandits, (she thought she was in Greece, but she was only in the 19th Ward.)
10019{_}690{_}They seized her.
10019{_}691{_}"Not a word," said the leader.
10019{_}692{_}"Your money or your life."
10019{_}693{_}Now G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}694{_}had lots of life and very little money, so she could hardly determine whether to give up some of her life or all of her money.
10019{_}695{_}"Illustrious banditti," said she, "the auriferous contents of my reticulated depository are notable for minuteness.
10019{_}696{_}Be conservators of my pullulating existence."
10019{_}697{_}"I say, TOM," said the leader, "what's her little game?"
10019{_}698{_}"It sounds like Irish," said TOM.
10019{_}699{_}"Hand over your stamps," said the leader.
10019{_}700{_}G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}701{_}slowly drew out her net purse, when suddenly the robbers fled.
10019{_}702{_}G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}703{_}felt that her hero had come, and, like all the ARAMINTAS in the novels, she fainted and was caught in the arms of--  CHAPTER III.
10019{_}704{_}The author tried to persuade the editor to allow him to write "to be continued" after the last thrilling chapter, but the editor was inexorable, hence this chapter, "in the arms of"--a little red-headed policeman.
10019{_}705{_}G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}706{_}smiled gently, but, as soon as she had opened her eyes, and had cast them on the red head, freckled face, pug-nose, and little eyes of MIKE MCFLYNN, she sprang to her feet.
10019{_}707{_}It was better than forty gallons of hartshorn.
10019{_}708{_}She had wasted a faint.
10019{_}709{_}"_Perdidi animi deliquium_," said she.
10019{_}710{_}"Mother of MOSES, but you was heavy!"
10019{_}711{_}said MCFLYNN.
10019{_}712{_}But she did not wait, and a pair of number eight shoes might have been seen by an inquisitive reporter, cutting around the corners and stamping up seven flights of stairs.
10019{_}713{_}MORAL.
10019{_}714{_}When the paternal turnip solemnly points to 10-1/2, G.F.F.F.S.
10019{_}715{_}puts her number eights on the mantel, looks reflectively at a sore-eyed kitten, and falls into polysyllables.

10019{_}717{_}Late advices from China convey the intelligence that the American-Chinese General WARD, who died in the service of the Celestial empire, has been postmortuarily brevetted to the rank of a "major god," and is now regularly worshipped as such by JOHN PIGTAIL.
10019{_}718{_}Possibly the antithesis to this may turn up on the cards, here.
10019{_}719{_}In the course of events the bronze idol to which our PHILLIPSES and SUMNERS used to bend the knee, has been prostrated from his pedestal by the Fifteenth Amendment.
10019{_}720{_}Coolie labor, with its possible abuses, may engage the attention of the philanthropists, next, and we may yet behold JOHN PIGTAIL on a pedestal, in the character of an American "major god."

10019{_}722{_}In the culinary department of a newspaper we find a recipe for making "bird's nest pudding," which would surely make the pigtail of a JOHN Chinaman stick straight up on end.
10019{_}723{_}The component parts of the pudding are apples, sugar, milk, five eggs, and vanilla.
10019{_}724{_}Perhaps the inventor of the pudding once found a bird's nest with five eggs in it, and has thus essayed to immortalize the interesting fact.

10019{_}956{_}Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
10019{_}957{_}It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
10019{_}958{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10019{_}959{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10019{_}969{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10019{_}970{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10019{_}971{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10019{_}972{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
10019{_}973{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
10019{_}974{_}To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

10019{_}976{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

10019{_}978{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10019{_}980{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10019{_}981{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10019{_}982{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10019{_}983{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10019{_}984{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10019{_}985{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10019{_}986{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10019{_}987{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10019{_}988{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10019{_}989{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10019{_}990{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10019{_}991{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10019{_}992{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10019{_}993{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10019{_}994{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10019{_}995{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10019{_}996{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
