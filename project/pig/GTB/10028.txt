10028{_}5{_}[Advertisement]  AMERICA'S NATIONAL GAME  By A. G. SPALDING  PRICE, $2.00 NET  A book of 600 pages, profusely illustrated with over 100 full page engravings, and having sixteen forceful cartoons by Homer C. Davenport, the famous American artist.
10028{_}6{_}The above work should have a place in every public library in this country, as also in the libraries of public schools and private houses.
10028{_}7{_}The author of "America's National Game" is conceded, always, everywhere, and by everybody, to have the best equipment of any living writer to treat the subject that forms the text of this remarkable volume, viz., the story of the origin, development and evolution of Base Ball, the National Game of our country.
10028{_}8{_}Almost from the very inception of the game until the present time--as player, manager and magnate--Mr. Spalding has been closely identified with its interests.
10028{_}9{_}Not infrequently he has been called upon in times of emergency to prevent threatened disaster.
10028{_}10{_}But for him the National Game would have been syndicated and controlled by elements whose interests were purely selfish and personal.
10028{_}11{_}The book is a veritable repository of information concerning players, clubs and personalities connected with the game in its early days, and is written in a most interesting style, interspersed with enlivening anecdotes and accounts of events that have not heretofore been published.
10028{_}12{_}The response on the part of the press and the public to Mr. Spalding's efforts to perpetuate the early history of the National Game has been very encouraging and he is in receipt of hundreds of letters and notices, a few of which are here given.
10028{_}13{_}ROBERT ADAMSON, New York, writing from the office of Mayor Gaynor, says:--"Seeing the Giants play is my principal recreation and I am interested in reading everything I can find about the game.
10028{_}14{_}I especially enjoy what you [Mr. Spalding] have written, because you stand as the highest living authority on the game."
10028{_}15{_}BARNEY DREYFUSS, owner of the Pittsburg National League club:--"It does honor to author as well as the game.
10028{_}16{_}I have enjoyed reading it very much."
10028{_}17{_}WALTER CAMP, well known foot ball expert and athlete, says:--"It is indeed a remarkable work and one that I have read with a great deal of interest."
10028{_}18{_}JOHN B.
10028{_}19{_}DAY, formerly President of the New York Nationals:--"Your wonderful work will outlast all of us."
10028{_}20{_}W. IRVING SNYDER, formerly of the house of Peck & Snyder:--"I have read the book from cover to cover with great interest."
10028{_}21{_}ANDREW PECK, formerly of the celebrated firm of Peck & Snyder:--"All base ball fans should read and see how the game was conducted in early years."
10028{_}22{_}MELVILLE E. STONE, New York, General Manager Associated Press:--"I find it full of valuable information and very interesting.
10028{_}23{_}I prize it very highly."
10028{_}24{_}GEORGE BARNARD, Chicago:--"Words fail to express my appreciation of the book.
10028{_}25{_}It carries me back to the early days of base ball and makes me feel like a young man again."
10028{_}26{_}CHARLES W. MURPHY, President Chicago National League club:--"The book is a very valuable work and will become a part of every base ball library in the country."
10028{_}27{_}JOHN F. MORILL, Boston, Mass., old time base ball star.--"I did not think it possible for one to become so interested in a book on base ball.
10028{_}28{_}I do not find anything in it which I can criticise."
10028{_}29{_}RALPH D. PAINE, popular magazine writer and a leading authority on college sport:--"I have been reading the book with a great deal of interest.
10028{_}30{_}'It fills a long felt want,' and you are a national benefactor for writing it."
10028{_}31{_}GEN. FRED FUNSTON, hero of the Philippine war:--"I read the book with a great deal of pleasure and was much interested in seeing the account of base ball among the Asiatic whalers, which I had written for Harper's Round Table so many years ago."
10028{_}32{_}DEWOLF HOPPER, celebrated operatic artist and comedian:--"Apart from the splendid history of the evolution of the game, it perpetuates the memories of the many men who so gloriously sustained it.
10028{_}33{_}It should be read by every lover of the sport."
10028{_}34{_}HUGH NICOL, Director of Athletics, Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind.
10028{_}35{_}:--"No one that has read this book has appreciated it more than I.
10028{_}36{_}Ever since I have been big enough, I have been in professional base ball, and you can imagine how interesting the book is to me."
10028{_}37{_}MRS. BRITTON, owner of the St. Louis Nationals, through her treasurer, H.D.
10028{_}38{_}Seekamp, writes:--"Mrs. Britton has been very much interested in the volume and has read with pleasure a number of chapters, gaining valuable information as to the history of the game."
10028{_}39{_}REV.
10028{_}40{_}CHARLES H. PARKHURST, D.D., New York:--"Although I am not very much of a 'sport,' I nevertheless believe in sports, and just at the present time in base ball particularly.
10028{_}41{_}Perhaps if all the Giants had an opportunity to read the volume before the recent game (with the Athletics) they might not have been so grievously outdone."
10028{_}42{_}BRUCE CARTWRIGHT, son of Alexander J. Cartwright, founder of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club, the first organization of ball players in existence, writing from his home at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, says:--"I have read the book with great interest and it is my opinion that no better history of base ball could have been written."
10028{_}43{_}GEORGE W. FROST, San Diego, Calif.:--"You and 'Jim' White, George Wright, Barnes, McVey, O'Rourke, etc., were little gods to us back there in Boston in those days of '74 and '75, and I recall how indignant we were when you 'threw us down' for the Chicago contract.
10028{_}44{_}The book is splendid.
10028{_}45{_}I treasure it greatly."
10028{_}46{_}A.J.
10028{_}47{_}REACH, Philadelphia, old time professional expert:--"It certainly is an interesting revelation of the national game from the time, years before it was so dignified, up to the present.
10028{_}48{_}Those who have played the game, or taken an interest in it in the past, those at present engaged in it, together with all who are to engage in it, have a rare treat in store."
10028{_}49{_}DR. LUTHER H. GULICK, Russell Sage Foundation:--"Mr. Spalding has been the largest factor in guiding the development of the game and thus deserves to rank with other great men of the country who have contributed to its success.
10028{_}50{_}It would have added to the interest of the book if Mr. Spalding could have given us more of his own personal experiences, hopes and ambitions in connection with the game."
10028{_}51{_}_Pittsburg Press_:--"Historical incidents abound and the book is an excellent authority on the famous sport."
10028{_}52{_}_Philadelphia Telegraph_:--"In this book Mr. Spalding has written the most complete and authoritative story of base ball yet published."
10028{_}53{_}_New York Herald_:--"If there is anyone in the country competent to write a book on base ball it is A.G. Spalding who has been interested in the game from its early beginnings."
10028{_}54{_}I.E.
10028{_}55{_}Sanborn, Chicago _Tribune_:--"'America's National Game' has been added to the _Tribune's_ sporting reference library as an invaluable contribution to the literature of the national pastime."
10028{_}56{_}O.C.
10028{_}57{_}Reichard, Chicago _Daily News_:--"It is cleverly written and presents information and dates of great value to the newspaper man of to-day!"
10028{_}58{_}George C. Rice, Chicago _Journal_:--"I have read the book through, and take pleasure in stating that it is a complete history of the game from the beginning until the present time."
10028{_}59{_}Sherman R. Duffy, Sporting Editor _Chicago Journal_:--"It is a most interesting work and one for which there was need.
10028{_}60{_}It is the most valuable addition to base ball literature that has yet been put out."
10028{_}61{_}Joseph H. Vila, New York _Sun_:--"I have read it carefully and with much interest.
10028{_}62{_}It is the best piece of base ball literature I have ever seen, and I congratulate you on the work."
10028{_}63{_}Tim Murnane, Sporting Editor _Boston Globe_:--"You have given to the world a book of inestimable value, a classic in American history; a book that should be highly prized in every home library in the country."
10028{_}64{_}Francis C. Richter, Editor _Sporting Life_, Philadelphia:--"From a purely literary standpoint, your work is to me amazing.
10028{_}65{_}Frankly, I would not change a line, for the reason that the story is told in a way to grip the reader and hold his interest continually."
10028{_}66{_}_Los Angeles Times_ (editorial):--"Spalding's book has been out six months and ninety thousand copies have been sold.
10028{_}67{_}We understand there will be other editions.
10028{_}68{_}America has taken base ball seriously for at last two generations, and it is time enough that the fad was given an adequate text book."
10028{_}69{_}Caspar Whitney, Editor _Outdoor America_, and one of the leading authorities in the world on sport:--"You have made an invaluable contribution to the literature of the game, and one none else could have made.
10028{_}70{_}Moreover, you've done some very interesting writing, which is a distinct novelty in such books--too often dull and uninteresting."
10028{_}71{_}_New York World_:--"Albert G. Spalding, who really grew up with the sport, has written 'America's National Game,' which he describes as not a history, but the simple story of the game as he has come to know it.
10028{_}72{_}His book, therefore, is full of living interest.
10028{_}73{_}It is a volume generously illustrated and abounds in personal memories of base ball in the making."
10028{_}74{_}_New York Sun_:--"There is a mass of interesting information regarding base ball, as might be expected, in Mr. Spalding's 'America's National Game.'
10028{_}75{_}It is safe to say that before Spalding there was no base ball.
10028{_}76{_}The book is no record of games and players, but it is historical in a broader sense, and the author is able to give his personal decisive testimony about many disputed points."
10028{_}77{_}_Evening Telegram_, New York:--"In clear, concise, entertaining, narrative style, Albert G. Spalding has contributed in many respects the most interesting work pertaining to base ball, the national game, which has been written.
10028{_}78{_}"There is so much in it of interest that the temptation not to put it down until it is completed is strong within the mind of every person who begins to read it.
10028{_}79{_}As a historical record it is one of those volumes which will go further to straighten some disputed points than all of the arguments which could be advanced in good natured disputes which might last for months."
10028{_}80{_}_Providence_ (R.
10028{_}81{_}I.)
10028{_}82{_}_Tribune_:--"The pictures of old time teams players and magnates of a bygone era will interest every lover of the game, and no doubt start many discussions and recollections among the old timers."
10028{_}83{_}_New York Evening Mail_:--"Were it possible to assemble the grand army of base ball fans in convention, their first act probably would be to pass a vote of thanks to Mr. A.G. Spalding for his work 'America's National Game'."
10028{_}84{_}_Columbus_ (Ohio) _Dispatch_:--"Never before has been put in print so much of authentic record of this distinctly national game, and it will be long, if ever, until so thoroughly interesting and useful a volume is published to cover the same field."
10028{_}85{_}_New Orleans Picayune_:--"The pictures of old time teams, players and magnates of a bygone era will interest every lover of the game.
10028{_}86{_}Homer Davenport, America's great cartoonist, has contributed drawings in his inimitable style of various phases of the game."
10028{_}87{_}_Indianapolis Star_:--"From cover to cover, the 542 pages are filled with material for 'fanning bees,' which the average 'fan' never before encountered.
10028{_}88{_}It is an interesting volume for anyone who follows the national pastime and a valuable addition to any library."
10028{_}89{_}_Buffalo News_:--"No book on base ball has ever been written that is superior to this one by A.G. Spalding.
10028{_}90{_}The book is admirably written, yet without any frills.
10028{_}91{_}Many of the more notable incidents recounted in this book are having wide publication by themselves."
10028{_}92{_}_Brooklyn Times_:--"The book is practically a compendium of the salient incidents in the evolution of professional base ball.
10028{_}93{_}Mr. Spalding is pre-eminently fitted to perform this service, his connection with the game having been contemporaneous with its development, as player, club owner and league director."
10028{_}94{_}_Washington_ (D. C.) _Star_:--"This work appeals with peculiar force to the public.
10028{_}95{_}Mr. Spalding's name is almost synonymous with base ball.
10028{_}96{_}He has worked to the end of producing a volume which tells the story of the game vividly and accurately.
10028{_}97{_}Taken altogether, this is a most valuable and entertaining work."
10028{_}98{_}_New York American_:--"One of the best selling books of the season has been 'America's National Game,' by A.G. Spalding.
10028{_}99{_}The first edition of five thousand copies has been sold out (in two months) and a second edition of five thousand is now on the press.
10028{_}100{_}As a Christmas gift from father to son, it is most appropriate."
10028{_}101{_}_Cincinnati Enquirer_:--"As a veteran of the diamond, well qualified to do so, Mr. Spalding has committed to print a professional's version of the distinctly American game.
10028{_}102{_}This well known base ball celebrity has a store of familiar anecdotes embracing the entire period of the game as now played and the reader will find it most interesting."
10028{_}103{_}_Teacher and Home, New York_:--"Every live father of a live boy will want to buy this book.
10028{_}104{_}It is said of some of the 'best sellers' that they hold one to the end.
10028{_}105{_}This book holds the reader with its anecdote, its history, its pictures; but it will have no end; for no home--no American home--will be complete hereafter without it."
10028{_}106{_}_Buffalo Times_:--"A.G. Spalding, with whose name every American boy is familiar, has been prevailed upon to commit to print events which were instrumental in guiding the destinies of the National League during the trying period of its early days.
10028{_}107{_}To write upon base ball in a historical manner, and yet not fall into the habit of quoting interminable statistics, is a feat that few could accomplish."
10028{_}108{_}_Cincinnati Times-Star_:--"'America's National Game,' A.G. Spalding's great book upon the diamond sport, is now upon the market and receiving well merited attention.
10028{_}109{_}It tells the story as Mr. Spalding saw it, and no man has been in position to see more.
10028{_}110{_}When 'Al' Spalding, the sinewy pitcher of nearly forty years ago, came into the arena, the game was young, and through all the changing seasons that have seen it mature into full bloom, its closest watcher and strongest friend has been the same 'Al' Spalding."
10028{_}111{_}_Cincinnati Time-Star_:--"The book is at once a history, a cyclopaedia and a most entertaining volume."
10028{_}112{_}_New York American_:--"'America's National Game' tells for the first time the history of the national game of base ball."
10028{_}113{_}_Portland Oregonian_:--"The book is of rare interest and has such personal value in the story line that one hardly knows where to begin in making quotations from it--all the stories told are so admirable."
10028{_}114{_}JOHN T. NICHOLSON, Principal Public School 186, New York:--"It's a great book."
10028{_}115{_}REV.
10028{_}116{_}W.A.
10028{_}117{_}SUNDAY, Evangelist:--"No one in America is better qualified to talk of base ball, from its inception to its present greatness, than A.G.
10028{_}118{_}Spalding."
10028{_}119{_}WM.
10028{_}120{_}L. VEECK and ED.
10028{_}121{_}W. SMITH, of the Chicago _American_:--"We have found much enjoyment in reading the book, and it is very valuable in our work."
10028{_}122{_}W.H.
10028{_}123{_}CONANT, Gossamer Rubber Co., Boston, Mass.
10028{_}124{_}:--"I have read the book with great pleasure and it produced a vivid reminiscence of the striking events in base ball, so full of interest to all lovers of the game."
10028{_}125{_}JOSEPH B. MACCABE, Editor East Boston (Mass.)
10028{_}126{_}_Argus-Advocate_, and ex-President Amateur Athletic Union:--"I want to express my gratitude, as a humble follower of manly sport, for the compilation of this historic work."
10028{_}127{_}JOHN A. LOWELL, President John A. Lowell Bank Note Company, Boston, Mass.
10028{_}128{_}:--"I have read the book with great interest and it certainly is a valuable compilation of facts relating to the history of base ball, the great national game of America.
10028{_}129{_}I prize it very highly."
10028{_}130{_}WM.
10028{_}131{_}F. GARCELON, Harvard Athletic Association, Cambridge, Mass.
10028{_}132{_}:--"I think 'America's National Game' is not only intensely interesting but most valuable, as giving the history of the game.
10028{_}133{_}Better still, my nine year old boy is looking forward to the time when he can get it away from me."
10028{_}134{_}GUSTAV T. KIRBY, President of the Amateur Athletic Union:--"Not only as a historical sketch of this great national game, but also as a technical dissertation on base ball as it was and is, this book will not only be of interest but of benefit to all of us Americans who are interested in sport--and what American is not interested in sport?--and being interested in sport, chiefly in base ball."
10028{_}135{_}EVERETT C. BROWN, Chicago, ex-president of the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States:--"It is very seldom that any history of any sport or anything pertaining to athletics approaches the interest with which one reads a popular work of fiction, but I can truthfully say that I have read the story of the great national game with as much interest as I have read any recent work of fiction."
10028{_}136{_}THOMAS F. GRAHAM, Judge Superior Court, San Francisco:--"'America's National Game' contains matter on the origin and development of base ball--the greatest game ever devised by man--that will be of the utmost interest to the base ball loving people, not only of this, but of every English speaking country; and I am sure it will perpetuate the name of A.G. Spalding to the end of time."

10028{_}142{_}INTRODUCTION   In preparing this issue of SPALDING'S OFFICIAL BASE BALL GUIDE for the season of 1913, it has occurred to the Editor that the season of 1912, and the period which followed its completion, have been filled, with a great deal of unusual and uncommon vicissitude.
10028{_}143{_}In the first place the personnel of the National League, the oldest Base Ball organization in the world, has been greatly changed by reason of death and purchase of one franchise.
10028{_}144{_}New owners have brought new faces into the game, and when the National League starts on this year's campaign there will be some younger but equally as ambitious men at the heads of some of the clubs.
10028{_}145{_}The players have effected an organization.
10028{_}146{_}That, too, is an incident of interest, for it is well within the memory of the Base Ball "fans" of this day what happened when another organization was perfected in the past.
10028{_}147{_}For this organization it may be said that the members promise that it will be their object to bring about better deportment on the part of their own associates and that they will work their best for the advancement of Base Ball from a professional standpoint.
10028{_}148{_}If they do this they will be of benefit to the sport.
10028{_}149{_}If they work from selfish motives it is inevitable that eventually there will be a clash, as there was in the past.
10028{_}150{_}The last world's series which was played was the greatest special series of games which has been played in the history of the national pastime.
10028{_}151{_}There may have been single games and there may have been series which have attracted their full measure of interest from the Base Ball "fans," but there never has been a special series so filled with thrills and excitement as that between the New York and Boston clubs.
10028{_}152{_}The GUIDE this year enters into the subject thoroughly with photographs and a story of the games and feels that the readers will enjoy the account of the contests.
10028{_}153{_}Some innovations have been attempted in this number of the GUIDE which should interest Base Ball readers.
10028{_}154{_}Attention is called to the symposium by prominent Base Ball writers which brings up a subject of interest in regard to future world's series.
10028{_}155{_}There are other special articles, including something about the Base Ball writers of the South, who have decided to organize a chapter of their own.
10028{_}156{_}The year 1912 was one of progress and advancement on the part of Base Ball throughout the world.
10028{_}157{_}To-day it not only is stronger than ever as America's national game but it is making fast progress in other countries because of the attractiveness of the pastime.
10028{_}158{_}The Editor of the GUIDE wishes its thousands of readers an even more enjoyable Base Ball year in 1913 than they had in 1912.
10028{_}159{_}This publication is now one of worldwide circulation, and carries the gospel of Base Ball, not only across the Atlantic ocean, but across the Pacific ocean as well.
10028{_}160{_}One of these days it may be its province to report a series for the international championship, and then Base Ball will have become the universal game of the world, a place toward which it is rapidly tending.
10028{_}161{_}THE EDITOR.
10028{_}162{_}EDITORIAL COMMENT  BY JOHN B.
10028{_}163{_}FOSTER.
10028{_}164{_}PROGRESS OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL GAME  Two more nations have been conquered by the national game of the United States; a whole race has succumbed to the fascinations of the greatest of all outdoor sports.
10028{_}165{_}Both France and Sweden have announced their intention of organizing Base Ball leagues.
10028{_}166{_}That of Sweden is well under way.
10028{_}167{_}Indeed, they have a club in Stockholm and there are more to follow, while the French, who have gradually been awakening to the joys of athletic pastime in which they have hitherto chosen to participate in other ways, hope to have a new league by the expiration of the present summer.
10028{_}168{_}There is no doubt as to their intention to play Base Ball.
10028{_}169{_}They are making efforts to procure suitable players from the United States to coach them and the French promoters of the sport are determined that their young men shall be given every opportunity to take advantage of the game of which they have heard so much, and have seen so little.
10028{_}170{_}Last year in the GUIDE it was the pleasure of the editor to call attention to the fact that the Japanese had so thoroughly grasped Base Ball that they were bent on some day playing an American team for the international championship.
10028{_}171{_}It is not probable that such a series will take place within the next five years, but not improbable that it will take place within the next decade.
10028{_}172{_}When the Japanese learn to bat better, and with more effect, they will become more dangerous rivals to the peace of mind of the American players.
10028{_}173{_}They have grasped the general theory of the game amazingly well, and they field well, but they have yet to develop some of those good old fashioned "clean up" hitters in which the "fans" of the United States revel.
10028{_}174{_}This season it comes to the attention of the editor of the GUIDE that more progress has been made in China in regard to Base Ball than in any fifty years preceding.
10028{_}175{_}True, there was not much Base Ball in the fifty years preceding, but now there is.
10028{_}176{_}There is a league at Hong Kong.
10028{_}177{_}There are Base Ball teams at Shanghai and other cities.
10028{_}178{_}Dr. Eliot, former president of Harvard, who recently returned from a trip around the world, holds that Base Ball has done more to humanize and civilize the Chinese than any influence which has been introduced by foreigners, basing his statement on the fact that the introduction of the sport among the younger Chinese has exerted a tremendous restraint upon their gambling propensities.
10028{_}179{_}It is a rather queer fact that where the civilizations are older in the countries of the Occident there is a greater tendency to gamble, especially among the young, than there is in the newer America.
10028{_}180{_}Doubtless this is largely due to the lack of athletic pastime.
10028{_}181{_}The young of those countries know little or nothing about simple amusements which are so popular in the United States, and acquire from their elders their knowledge of betting and taking part in games of chance, two evils which unquestionably have done much to degrade the race as a whole.
10028{_}182{_}Base Ball has caught the fancy of the younger generation and the boys.
10028{_}183{_}Once they get a ball and a bat in their hands they are better satisfied with them than with all the gambling devices which have been bequeathed to them by a long and eminent line of forefathers.
10028{_}184{_}So it would appear that the introduction of the national game of the United States into China is likely to exert a humanizing influence which shall go further than legislation or sword, and if only the missionaries had grasped earlier the wishes and the tendency of the younger element of the Chinese population, the country might be further along than it is with its progressive movement.
10028{_}185{_}In the Philippine Islands the younger generation simply has gone wild over Base Ball.
10028{_}186{_}Progress has been noted in the GUIDE from time to time of the increase of interest but it is now at such a pitch that the boys of the islands, wherever Base Ball has been introduced, simply have deserted everything for it.
10028{_}187{_}They will play nothing else.
10028{_}188{_}The cockfights and the gambling games, which were also a part of the amusement of the younger men, have been given up.
10028{_}189{_}The little fellows who wear not much more than a breechclout play Base Ball.
10028{_}190{_}They have picked up many of the American terms and one of the most amusing of experiences is to stand outside the walls of old Manila and hear the little brown boys call: "Shoot it over.
10028{_}191{_}Line it out," and the like, returning to their native language, and jabbering excitedly in Filipino whenever they arrive at some point of play in which their command of English fails them.
10028{_}192{_}Twenty years from now a league including cities of the Philippines, China and Japan, is by no means out of the question, and it may be that the introduction of Base Ball into all three countries will result in a better understanding between the peoples and perhaps bring all three races to a better frame of mind as relates to their personal ambitions and rivalries.
10028{_}193{_}In connection with the widespread influence which Base Ball is having on both sides of the world, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and on those of the Atlantic Ocean the editor would like to call attention to the theory which has been advanced by Mr. A.G. Spalding, the founder of the GUIDE, as to the efficacy of Base Ball for the purpose of training athletes, that has a worldwide application.
10028{_}194{_}Mr. Spalding contends that Base Ball has lent no small assistance to the athletes of the United States in helping them to win premier honors at the Olympic Games since their reintroduction.
10028{_}195{_}Mr. Spalding was the first American Commissioner to the Olympic Games appointed to that post, the honor being conferred upon him in 1900, when the late President McKinley gave him his commission to represent the United States at Paris in 1900.
10028{_}196{_}Mr. Spalding, with his analytical mind has reasoned out a theory which is undoubtedly of great accuracy, and which is further corroborated by an interview given out in London--strangely enough on the same day that Mr. Spalding gave utterance to his ideas in Los Angeles--by Mr. J.E.
10028{_}197{_}Sullivan, American Commissioner to the Olympic Games at Stockholm last year, while returning to the United States after witnessing the triumphs of the Americans.
10028{_}198{_}Mr. Spalding said:  "I cannot say that I am at all surprised at the result at Stockholm.
10028{_}199{_}History has been repeating itself in this way ever since the celebration of the Olympic games was inaugurated at Athens.
10028{_}200{_}America won the victory there in 1896; she triumphed again at Paris in 1900; our athletes defeated the contestants at St. Louis in 1904; the victory was ours at London in 1908, and it was a foregone conclusion that we would win at Stockholm.
10028{_}201{_}"But there is food for thought in this uninterrupted succession of triumphs.
10028{_}202{_}Why do our athletes always win?
10028{_}203{_}All other things being equal, the contestants in the country holding the event should naturally come to the front.
10028{_}204{_}Their numbers are always greater than those from any other country and the home grounds influence is strong.
10028{_}205{_}However, that advantage has not in any case prevented American success.
10028{_}206{_}"Therefore there must be a cause.
10028{_}207{_}What is it?
10028{_}208{_}Measured by scale and tape, our athlete's are not so much superior as a class.
10028{_}209{_}The theory of 'more beef' must be discarded.
10028{_}210{_}We may not lay claim to having all the best trainers of the world.
10028{_}211{_}We must look to some other source for American prowess.
10028{_}212{_}"I may be a prejudiced judge, but I believe the whole secret of these continued successes is to be found to the kind of training that comes with the playing of America's national game, and our competitors in other lands may never hope to reach the standard of American athletes until they learn this lesson and adopt our pastime.
10028{_}213{_}"The question, 'When should the training of a child begin?'
10028{_}214{_}has been wisely answered by the statement that it should antedate his birth.
10028{_}215{_}The training of Base Ball may not go back quite that far, but it approaches the time as nearly as practicable, for America starts training of future Olympian winners very early in life.
10028{_}216{_}Youngsters not yet big enough to attend school begin quickening their eyesight and sharpening their wits and strengthening their hands and arms and legs by playing on base ball fields ready at hand in the meadows of farms, the commons of villages and the parks of cities all over the land.
10028{_}217{_}Base ball combines running, jumping, throwing and everything that constitutes the athletic events of the Olympian games.
10028{_}218{_}But above all, it imparts to the player that degree of confidence in competition, that indefinable something that enables one athlete to win over another who may be his physical equal but who is lacking the American spirit begotten of base ball.
10028{_}219{_}"An analysis of the 1912 Olympian games shows that the American showed to best advantage in contests where the stress of competition was hardest.
10028{_}220{_}In the dashes they were supreme; in the hurdles they were in a class by themselves, and in the high jump and pole vault there was no one worthy of their steel.
10028{_}221{_}Whenever quick thinking and acting was required, an American was in front.
10028{_}222{_}Does not this fact prove that the American game of base ball enables the player to determine in the fraction of a second what to do to defeat his contestant?"
10028{_}223{_}*       *       *       *       *  WHAT A SEASON OF BASE BALL COSTS  It may not be out of place to say a few words in regard to the greatly increased cost of Base Ball.
10028{_}224{_}There are some sensational writers whose hobby is to inform the public about the great receipts in Base Ball.
10028{_}225{_}Usually they exaggerate from twenty-five to thirty-five per cent.
10028{_}226{_}Now as to the expense of Base Ball.
10028{_}227{_}Figures at an approximate for the National League will be offered.
10028{_}228{_}Railroad expenses for mileage alone $300,000, including spring training trips.
10028{_}229{_}Hotel bills $65,000.
10028{_}230{_}Sleeping cars and meals en route, $80,000.
10028{_}231{_}Salaries to players, $480,000.
10028{_}232{_}Total, $875,000.
10028{_}233{_}Add to this $30,000 for the salaries of umpires and their traveling expenses.
10028{_}234{_}That makes $905,000.
10028{_}235{_}Now not a penny has been appropriated thus far for the salaries of the president of the National League, the secretary and expenditures of the office nor for the salaries of the business departments of the various clubs, nor for ground rents, taxes and a dozen and one other things, to say nothing of that well-known old item "wear and tear."
10028{_}236{_}The receipts of Base Ball barely cover these expenditures.
10028{_}237{_}The alleged profits of Base Ball mostly are fanciful dreams of those who know nothing of the practical side of the sport and are stunned when they are made acquainted with the real financial problems which confront club owners.
10028{_}238{_}But the money that is contributed to the support of the game almost immediately finds its way back into public channels.
10028{_}239{_}Less than thirty per cent.
10028{_}240{_}of Base Ball clubs realize what a business man would call a fair return on the amount invested.
10028{_}241{_}A well-known writer on economic topics interviewed owners of Base Ball clubs as to their income and outgo.
10028{_}242{_}One of the best known of the National League men took the writer into his office and spread the cash book of the club's business before him.
10028{_}243{_}"You may go through it if you wish," said the owner, "but here is the balance for the last day of the year."
10028{_}244{_}It read as follows: Receipts, $250,505; expenditures, $246,447.
10028{_}245{_}"That's answer enough for me," said the writer.
10028{_}246{_}"I am through with any more essays on the affluence of Base Ball 'magnates.'
10028{_}247{_}I think it would be better to extend them the hand of charity than the mailed fist."
10028{_}248{_}*       *       *       *       *  THE NEW ORGANIZATION OF PLAYERS  The formation of an organization on the part of the major league ball players during the closing days of the season of 1912 was looked upon with some misgivings by those who remember only too well what happened when a prior organization of ball players was formed.
10028{_}249{_}In the present instance those foremost in perfecting the organization have also been foremost in asserting that the players' organization's principal aim is to co-operate with the club owners.
10028{_}250{_}If this object is followed with fidelity and to its ultimate conclusion there is no necessity to fear any grave disturbances, but there is a dread--that dread which is the fear of the child that has had its hands burned by the flame, that a selfish coterie of players might obtain control of the organization, set up a policy of unscrupulous defiance and destructive opposition and retard for a moment the higher development of the game.
10028{_}251{_}There is no organization, either of unscrupulous Base Ball players or unscrupulous club owners, which will ever find it possible to destroy organized Base Ball.
10028{_}252{_}The results that organized Base Ball have brought about will never be annihilated although grave injury could be temporarily wrought by a force defiant to tie unusual demands made by the sport to perpetuate itself successfully.
10028{_}253{_}It is simply out of the question to control Base Ball as one would control the affairs of a department store.
10028{_}254{_}Base Ball has its commercial side, but its commercial side cannot maintain it with success.
10028{_}255{_}There must be a predominant factor based upon the encouragement that brings forth admiration for a high class sport.
10028{_}256{_}This factor can only be fostered by the ability to maintain not one, but a group of high class teams.
10028{_}257{_}Any ball player imbued with the idea that the "stars" should be grouped together in the city best able to pay the highest salaries simply is an enemy to his career and to those of his fellow players.
10028{_}258{_}Without some handicap to assist in the equalizing of the strength of Base Ball nines of the professional leagues there will be no prosperity for the leagues or the clubs individually.
10028{_}259{_}No better evidence may be cited to prove this than the fact, repeatedly demonstrated that in the smaller leagues Base Ball enthusiasts in the city best able to pay the largest salaries frequently withdraw their support of the team because "it wins all the time."
10028{_}260{_}To-day Base Ball, in its professional atmosphere, is nearer an ideal sport, a better managed sport, and a more fairly and equitably adjusted sport, than it ever has been, which is manifest proof of its superior evolution.
10028{_}261{_}Had results been otherwise it would have retrograded and possibly passed out of existence.
10028{_}262{_}Carefully comparing its management with that of all other sports in history the Editor of the GUIDE believes that it is the best managed sport in the world.
10028{_}263{_}It is true that improvements can be made.
10028{_}264{_}It is evident that there are still commercialized owners not over capitalized with a spirit of sport.
10028{_}265{_}It is undeniable that there are ball players not imbued with a high tone of the obligations, which they owe to their employers and to the public, but it is as certain as the existence of the game that progress has been made, and that it has not ceased to move forward.
10028{_}266{_}For that reason players and owners must be guided by a sense of lofty ideals and not be led astray by foolish outbursts over trivial differences of opinion, easily to be adjusted by the exercise of a little common sense.
10028{_}267{_}*       *       *       *       *  BASE BALL PLAYED IN SWEDEN  In connection with the subject of "Base Ball For All the World," for which the GUIDE expounds and spreads the gospel, the Editor would submit a very interesting letter received by him from Sweden.
10028{_}268{_}it reads as follows:  Westeras, Sweden, Sept. 14, 1912.
10028{_}269{_}To the Editor of the GUIDE:  We hereby have the pleasure of sending you two copies of the rules, translated and issued by the Westeras Base Ball Club, into Swedish from the Spalding Base Ball Guide.
10028{_}270{_}The work of getting the book out has been somewhat slow on account of that the work of translating, proofreading, etc., all had to be done on our spare time, but it is done now, and I think we have succeeded pretty well, everything considered.
10028{_}271{_}The books will be distributed by a well-known book firm, Bjork & Boyeson, Stockholm, and will soon be available in all the bookstores in Sweden.
10028{_}272{_}We got some advance copies out just in time for the Olympic Games, and I had the pleasure of presenting some copies to Commissioner Col. Thompson, Manager Halpin and others of the American Olympic Committee.
10028{_}273{_}As you know, so did we have a game of Base Ball at Stockholm with one of the Finland teams, and as it may be of some interest to you to know the preliminaries to the game, I am writing to relate how it happened.
10028{_}274{_}In trying to arrange for some amusements in the evenings at the Stadium, the Olympic Committee wrote us if we would be willing to take part in a game of Base Ball at Stadium some evening during the Stadium week.
10028{_}275{_}As our club this year was in poor condition, on account of some of our best players being out on military duties, we hesitated at first, but then decided to risk it, knowing very well that whoever we would play against, they would not rub in to us too hard.
10028{_}276{_}We pointed out to the Olympic Committee that it would not be very hard to get a team of Base Ball players picked out from the American athletes taking part in the contests, but as they would not be prepared for Base Ball, suits and other needed articles had to be provided for.
10028{_}277{_}We were then told to get necessary things ordered, and so we did.
10028{_}278{_}We ordered suits from a tailor in this town, after a pattern that I got from Spalding's this spring.
10028{_}279{_}The suits were of gray flannel, with blue trimmings for our team and red trimmings for the American.
10028{_}280{_}I also ordered bats and gloves, and with the things our club already had, we were very well equipped.
10028{_}281{_}The Olympic Committee, Stockholm, then received a letter from the Olympic Committee, New York, saying that if a game of Base Ball could be arranged for during the Olympian Games, they would bring two teams along on the Finland.
10028{_}282{_}The Olympic Committee cabled to come along, and sent us a copy of Mr. Sullivan's letter.
10028{_}283{_}I knew, of course, that if the game could be played by two American teams, it would be a much better game than if our team took part, and told the Olympic Committee, and wanted to withdraw, but as they did not know for sure how it would be, told us to go ahead with the arrangements just the same, and so we did, and by the time the Finland arrived, everything had been arranged for.
10028{_}284{_}The Olympic Committee has selected the evening, 7 P.M., of the 10th of July, for the game, and thought that this would be suitable to the Americans, but as some of the players had to take part in the contests, Mr. Halpin would not risk them then, so it was finally decided that a game should be played the 15th, the Americans to play six innings between themselves and then six innings against us.
10028{_}285{_}Well, we had a game at the training grounds.
10028{_}286{_}We played six innings, and Mr. Halpin was kind enough to let us have a pitcher and catcher from his men.
10028{_}287{_}The score was 9 to 3, and it could just as well been 9 to 0, perhaps.
10028{_}288{_}Well, at any rate, it was the first Base Ball game, as far as I know, that ever took place in Europe between an American team and a European team, with England possibly excepted.
10028{_}289{_}Mr. Halpin said that the Americans were going to play a game the next morning between themselves, but that game did not come off.
10028{_}290{_}There was probably no time for it, as the Finland left Stockholm the same day.
10028{_}291{_}Very likely the American boys were somewhat disappointed in not being able to play between themselves, as anticipated, and perhaps I should not have pushed our game ahead, but as long as there was a Base Ball team in Sweden, it would have been strange if it had not played, and it gave our boys a chance to see how the game should be played, and they certainly did take it in.
10028{_}292{_}Had the game been played as it was intended and advertised, on the 10th in the Stadium, there would very likely have been a bigger crowd present, and the game would also have been more talked about in the papers, but then we will have to be satisfied as it is.
10028{_}293{_}Our club has been practicing all summer, twice a week, and on the 24th of August we gave an exhibition game here at Westeras, between two teams from our club, the suits made for the Olympic Games coming in very handy.
10028{_}294{_}I send you herewith a clipping from a local paper describing the game, and also a picture of the two teams with myself and the umpire included.
10028{_}295{_}At our game here we distributed the "Description of Base Ball," written by you and translated into Swedish, and it came of good use.
10028{_}296{_}Next year we intend to have our teams appear in the nearby cities around here, so as to give people a chance to see the game, and it will not be long before they will start it in Stockholm, so I think the game is bound to be popular here also,  Mr. George Wright, of Boston, was the umpire at the Stockholm games, and as he was very kind to us, we would like to send him the picture of the club, and hope that you will forward us his address.
10028{_}297{_}I am, for Westeras Base Ball Club,  Yours truly,  EDWIN JOHNSON,  Electrical Engineer.
10028{_}298{_}*       *       *       *       *  THE NEW NATIONAL AGREEMENT  Unlimited satisfaction must be had by all who are connected with Base Ball over the greatly improved conditions by which the season of 1913 is begun under the new National Agreement.
10028{_}299{_}While it perhaps might be exaggerated boastfulness to affirm that Base Ball, as a professionally organized sport, has attained perfection, it is not out of reason-- indeed, quite within reason--to observe that Base Ball never had such a well balanced and perfect organization as that by which it is regulated at the present time.
10028{_}300{_}The principal fact of congratulation lies in the safeguards and provisions which have been thrown around the players of the minor leagues and in the equitable and just measures which have been agreed upon to provide for their future.
10028{_}301{_}As a general rule it may be taken for granted that the players of the major leagues can take care of themselves.
10028{_}302{_}That is to say, their positions, if they are expert in their calling, and conscientious in their deportment, really take care of them.
10028{_}303{_}No club owner, unless he is maliciously or foolishly inclined, will jeopardize the interests of his team by acting in a wilfully unjust manner toward a player who is cheerfully and uprightly offering his services.
10028{_}304{_}We may hear of occasional exceptions to this condition of things, but if these occasional exceptions chance to arise, it is inevitably certain that the owner in the long run will suffer to a greater degree than the player with whom he deals unfairly.
10028{_}305{_}It is the history of Base Ball that more inequitable treatment has arisen by fifty per cent in the minor leagues than has had its origin in the major leagues.
10028{_}306{_}The reason for this existed almost wholly in the inability of Base Ball as a whole to bring the minor league owners to a realization of the injury that they might be doing and to extend such punishment and insist upon such regulation as were necessary to change this undesirable condition.
10028{_}307{_}By the organization of the National Association of Base Ball clubs the minor leagues, for the first time in their history, placed themselves in a position where they could demand proper enforcement of regulations for the government of the sport, and by their alliance with the major league clubs, under the articles of the National Agreement, a general working basis was effected whereby compliance with rules could be insisted upon.
10028{_}308{_}The result of this admirable condition of affairs is that wisdom and equity now rule where there once existed chaos and at times something akin to anarchy in sport.
10028{_}309{_}At no time in the history of the game, which is so dear to the hearts of the American people, has the general legislative and executive body been so well equipped by the adoption of pertinent and virile laws to insist upon justice to all concerned as at the present moment.
10028{_}310{_}The new National Agreement is an improvement upon the old and the old was a long, long step in advance of anything which had preceded it.
10028{_}311{_}The mere fact that club owners and leagues were so willing to adopt a system better than its predecessor wholly confutes the absurd assertions of the radical element that there is no consideration shown for the player.
10028{_}312{_}To the contrary, every consideration has been shown to the player, but the latter must not confound with the consideration shown to him the idea that his interests are the only interests at stake in Base Ball.
10028{_}313{_}The man who is willing to furnish the sinews of war has as good standing in court as the player who furnishes the base hits and the phenomenal catches.
10028{_}314{_}So perfect is the system which is being attempted to be set in force by the new National Agreement that the young man who now essays to play professional Base Ball may be assured of steady advancement in this profession and a generally improving condition if he will be as honest by his employer as he expects his employer to be honest by him.
10028{_}315{_}The graduated system of assisting players, step by step, from the least important leagues to the most important is the most perfect plan of its kind that has ever been devised.
10028{_}316{_}There may be flaws in it, but if there are they will be remedied, and if modifications are necessary to make it more perfect there is no doubt that such modifications will be agreed upon.
10028{_}317{_}As proof of what the new National Agreement may do, although it has barely had time to be considered, the editor of the GUIDE would submit the following for consideration:  Ever since the National Agreement was organized the members have always striven to aid the players in their efforts to gain the top rank in the great national game.
10028{_}318{_}They have had a hard proposition in handling all of the cases that have been brought to their attention, but their decisions in all cases were absolutely fair and impartial.
10028{_}319{_}Then the matter of the new agreement occasioned many hours of laborious work on the part of the members of the Commission, and when the instrument was finally announced it meant that all of the parties to such an agreement were satisfied and that there could be no improvement.
10028{_}320{_}There was one detail that covered a wide field, and that was in the matter of players; drafted by the two big leagues and later sent back to the minors.
10028{_}321{_}Under the old National Agreement it was possible to pick up a player by means of the annual draft from one of the Class C leagues and just before the opening of the season send him back to the club from whence he came without ever having given him a chance to land with a club in some higher organization.
10028{_}322{_}Realizing that such players were not given a chance to advance in the Base Ball profession, this matter was thoroughly thrashed out and the new ruling under which all of the National Agreement clubs operate was adopted.
10028{_}323{_}Now it is possible for a player in any of the smaller leagues to be drafted by a major league club, and when the latter party does not care to retain possession of such a player he is first offered to the Class AA clubs.
10028{_}324{_}All of these clubs must waive on him before he can be dropped farther down in the list, and if such should be the case he would then be offered to the Class A clubs.
10028{_}325{_}In that way the player, although he is not fast enough to remain in the two major leagues, is always given a chance to advance, for if any of the clubs in those classes higher than that from which he came had grabbed him he was bound to receive an increase in salary.
10028{_}326{_}That meant that he had his chance to advance, and that was the sole purpose of the National Agreement in drafting such a rule.
10028{_}327{_}During the past drafting season there were sixty-nine players drafted by the two major league clubs, and of that number twenty-seven have already been sent back to the minor leagues.
10028{_}328{_}The Class AA and A clubs claimed all of these twenty-seven, and it is more than likely that there will also be many more who will be given trials by the big league clubs during the spring training season and who may later be turned back to the minors.
10028{_}329{_}Of the twenty-seven players thus far sent back seventeen of them advanced in their profession, a tribute to the sagacity, wisdom and impartiality of the members of the National Commission.
10028{_}330{_}The decision, as announced by Chairman Herrmann of the National Commission pertaining to this return of drafted players, is as follows:  ------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------------    Clubs.

10028{_}420{_}*       *       *       *       *  A WORLD'S SERIES PROBLEM  Much discussion arose after the finish of the last world's series as to whether the adjustment of dates had worked satisfactorily.
10028{_}421{_}The contention was that playing off a tie game on the ground where the game had been scheduled might work some inconvenience to "fans" and result in an inequitable allotment of dates, simply to conform to custom.
10028{_}422{_}It was asserted that the importance of the series demanded that it be a home-and-home affair, dates to alternate regularly, regardless of all ties or drawn games.
10028{_}423{_}To obtain opinion that is sound and practical the Editor of the GUIDE sent forth the following letter:   NEW YORK, January 31, 1913.
10028{_}424{_}During the recent world's series it so happened that a tie was played in one of the cities, which compelled both teams to remain in that city for another date.
10028{_}425{_}Before the series was over this arrangement resulted in one club having five games on its home grounds and the other club having but three games on its home grounds.
10028{_}426{_}It has seemed to some that it is unjust.
10028{_}427{_}It is also contended that it is unfair to the patrons of the game to schedule a contest and then not play in the city specified after some had traveled many miles to see it.
10028{_}428{_}Will you please give the GUIDE your opinion as to whether a change would be advisable?
10028{_}429{_}Very truly yours,  JOHN B.
10028{_}430{_}FOSTER, _Editor Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide._   Answers were received to the request for a "symposium of opinion" as follows:   "So far as having any effect on the chances of the two teams is concerned, I don't think having to play more games on one ground than on the other makes any material difference.
10028{_}431{_}Where cities are sufficiently near each other for games to be alternated daily, it would perhaps be fairer to spectators to do so, irrespective of ties; yet it seems to me that a tie on one grounds should be played off the next day in the same city."
10028{_}432{_}W.B.
10028{_}433{_}HANNA, _New York Sun._         *       *       *       *       *  "In my opinion the arrangement on tie games in the post-season contests is a poor one.
10028{_}434{_}I saw the result of it in the series between the Cubs and White Sox last fall.
10028{_}435{_}Two tie games were played and the confusion and inconvenience it caused the fans was deplorable.
10028{_}436{_}It is unjust to the followers who support Base Ball.
10028{_}437{_}It is also unjust, in a small way, to the club which has to play two or more games on its opponent's field.
10028{_}438{_}Players when away from their home grounds, in a fall series, are more or less under a nervous strain.
10028{_}439{_}If there was confusion, inconvenience and difficulty in a local series as a result of a tie game, the folly of the arrangement must appear more absurd when towns like New York and Boston are involved.
10028{_}440{_}Dates should alternate, tie or not tie."
10028{_}441{_}OSCAR C. REICHOW, _Chicago Daily News._         *       *       *       *       *  "We are in receipt of your favor of the 31st nlt., and wish to thank you for the opportunity presented.
10028{_}442{_}"It is our opinion that a tie game was played and it should be considered as a game.
10028{_}443{_}Either side had an opportunity to win and any advantage that the home club might have had was lost when it failed to break the tie.
10028{_}444{_}"It is, therefore, our belief that this game should have been played in the other city.
10028{_}445{_}"As to it being unfair to the patrons who had traveled so far to see the scheduled contest, there is no doubt that they were afforded a sufficient amount of amusement and excitement for their trouble, in witnessing a closely played contest."
10028{_}446{_}J. G. T. SPINK, _St.
10028{_}447{_}Louis Sporting News._         *       *       *       *       *  "It seems to me that the game should be alternated between the contending cities regardless of ties.
10028{_}448{_}The tie game gave Boston five games on the home grounds, while the Giants had only three.
10028{_}449{_}Besides, many persons, who traveled to see the games in New York, were inconvenienced."
10028{_}450{_}JOHN E. WHEELER, _New York Herald._         *       *       *       *       *  "I think that the scheduled programme should be played through irrespective of the results of the respective games, and any extra playing or playing-off should be done after the originally set schedule is completed."
10028{_}451{_}H. P. BORCHELL, _Sports Editor New York Times._         *       *       *       *       *  "I believe it would be inadvisable to change the method that now prevails.
10028{_}452{_}While the situation which arose last season did seem unjust to the New York club, I think the very fact that Boston had five games on its home grounds, and the Giants but three on their own diamond, was an answer to those ill-advised skeptics who are always ready to raise the cry of hippodroming.
10028{_}453{_}"That same situation is not likely to again arise for a long time, and I believe the rule as it stands is a guarantee to the public of the strict honesty of the world's championship contests."
10028{_}454{_}DAMON RUNYON, _The New York American._         *       *       *       *       *  "A change in the rules regarding world series games would he fairer to the patrons of the sport.
10028{_}455{_}Here in Chicago this past fall two ties were played and, as a result, there was considerable confusion over the ticket arrangements.
10028{_}456{_}How much more is the case when two cities are involved?
10028{_}457{_}A condition which allows five games to be played in one city and only three in another is scarcely fair to the two teams.
10028{_}458{_}By making a schedule calling for alternate games in each city, irrespective of ties, everybody--fans and players--would get an even break."
10028{_}459{_}MALCOLM MACLEAN, _Base Ball Editor Chicago Evening Post._         *       *       *       *       *  "I think it might be fairer to both world's series contenders to play a regular schedule, regardless of the fact that any tie games may arise in the series.
10028{_}460{_}Under the old system of playing the tie off in the city where the tie game is played, it brings about a great deal of confusion.
10028{_}461{_}Many fans make arrangements to see a game on a certain day and are greatly disappointed when the game is played in a different city.
10028{_}462{_}Of course, the old rule of playing the play-off game on the same grounds as the tie game, is fair to both contesting clubs, as it is merely a matter of chance where a tie game is played."
10028{_}463{_}FRED.
10028{_}464{_}G. LIEB, _New York Press._         *       *       *       *       *  "The rules regarding the manner of scheduling games for the world's series should not be changed.
10028{_}465{_}There are times when they apparently work a hardship to one team or the followers of one club, but, after all, they help to throw the necessary safeguards around the contests.
10028{_}466{_}As for the argument for not playing off a tie game on the same grounds, thus disarranging the dates and inconveniencing the fans, patrons of the world's series games are accustomed to this, since bad weather frequently cuts into the event and causes postponements.
10028{_}467{_}"In a way it does not appear fair that one club should have the privilege of playing five games at home to three games at home for its opponents.
10028{_}468{_}The rule of playing off a tie game on the same grounds is a fixture in Base Ball.
10028{_}469{_}As to the other game, this was a question of the luck of the toss of the coin.
10028{_}470{_}"The fans have to trust to luck as to the number of games they will see in a world's series, this depending upon the number of games played and possibly upon the toss for a seventh battle.
10028{_}471{_}In 1905 the fans of Philadelphia saw only two games in a world's series with New York.
10028{_}472{_}In 1910 only two games were played here in the series with Chicago.
10028{_}473{_}"Any time a club has three games on its own grounds in a series where four victories decide the issue either it or its followers have not much chance to raise an objection."
10028{_}474{_}WILLIAM G. WEART, _The Evening Telegraph._         *       *       *       *       *  "It was, of course, to the disadvantage of the Giants to be obliged to play five of the eight games in the post-season series last fall on the grounds of their opponents, but this came as a result of one tie game on the Boston grounds and being outlucked on the toss to determine where the deciding game should be played.
10028{_}475{_}This tie game unquestionably caused much inconvenience to patrons because of the change in the schedule made necessary because of it.
10028{_}476{_}"It is not clear to me, however, just now these things can be remedied without disturbing the balance of an even break for both teams more violently than was the case last fall.
10028{_}477{_}"I do not believe there will be another series just like the one of 1912, and so, in my opinion, an immediate change in the conditions governing these series would not be advisable.
10028{_}478{_}It is not clear to me just what changes could be made.
10028{_}479{_}One club or the other is bound to have the advantage of an extra game on its own grounds, providing seven games are necessary.
10028{_}480{_}The championship in nine out of ten contests will be decided in seven games or less.
10028{_}481{_}"Then, as to having the games played according to an arbitrarily fixed schedule, so as not to inconvenience patrons--that would be out of the question, being open to the objection that it would then be possible to have every game that figures in the result of the series played on the home grounds of one of the contestants.
10028{_}482{_}For instance, tie games or unfavorable weather which would prevent a game being played in one city, would throw all the games to the other city where there might be no tie games nor unfavorable weather.
10028{_}483{_}That would mean four straight, if it so happened that the home team won the games, and the loser would never have gotten action on its own grounds.
10028{_}484{_}That would be considerably worse than five to three.
10028{_}485{_}"So it looks to me as if the patrons would have to take their chances in the future as they have in the past."
10028{_}486{_}JAMES C. O'LEABT, _Boston Globe._         *       *       *       *       *  "It seems to me that it would be better to alternate (in case of a tie), as a team able to tie its opponent on a hostile field would be entitled to consideration for this performance.
10028{_}487{_}I am very certain, however, that the players of both clubs in the recent world's series were satisfied with an arrangement which minimized the amount of traveling they were called upon to do.
10028{_}488{_}"Persons who had seen a five-inning tie game terminated by rain would hardly be satisfied.
10028{_}489{_}It seems to me that the rule as to alternating ball parks should be applied strictly, but only in case the tie game involved went nine innings or more."
10028{_}490{_}FRANCIS EATON, _Sports Editor Boston Journal._         *       *       *       *       *  "To me the feasible thing to do appears to be to insert a clause in stipulations covering all short series of a special character, such as intercity, inter-league and world's series, making it compulsory for the teams to alternate between the cities or grounds of the competing clubs."
10028{_}491{_}PURVES T. KNOX, _New York Evening Telegram._         *       *       *       *       *  "Why wouldn't it be a good scheme to toss up for the deciding game only in cases where an equal number of games had been played in each city, and, in cases where one city had seen more games than the other, to play the deciding game in the city which had seen the fewer games?
10028{_}492{_}"I do not believe it advisable to change the commission's rule regarding postponed games.
10028{_}493{_}The rule now provides that, in case of a postponement, the clubs shall remain in the city in which the game was scheduled until it is possible to play.
10028{_}494{_}If this rule were changed and there happened to be a week of bad weather, as in 1911, the teams and many fans might be forced to travel back and forth from one town to another for a week without participating in or seeing a single game; and it might happen some time that the jump would be between St. Louis and Boston."
10028{_}495{_}R. W. LARDNER, _Chicago Examiner._         *       *       *       *       *  "A change in the rule governing the playing-off of tie games in the world's series should be made.
10028{_}496{_}The teams ought to appear in each city on the dates named in the schedule drawn up before the series starts, unless the weather interferes."
10028{_}497{_}WILLIAM H. WRIGHT, _New York Tribune._         *       *       *       *       *  "Drawn games are as unavoidable as rainy days in world's series, but not as frequent.
10028{_}498{_}They operate the same in their effect on the contest for the world's pennant and in causing confusion among the patrons by disarranging the schedule.
10028{_}499{_}It would be manifestly unjust if, after a rain postponement, the competing teams did not remain and play the game off before playing elsewhere.
10028{_}500{_}That might result in playing all of the games in one city.
10028{_}501{_}Since drawn games are treated like postponed games in the regular season, and are of infrequent occurrence in world's series, any other arrangement than the present does not seem advisable.
10028{_}502{_}The patrons, who should be considered always, would be among the first to object if each team did not have an equal show to win.
10028{_}503{_}In the last series only four games that counted were played in Boston and three in New York and if New York had won the toss for the deciding game the situation would have been reversed.
10028{_}504{_}It would be manifestly fairer to play the seventh game if necessary in some neutral city."
10028{_}505{_}L. E. SANBORN, _Chicago Tribune._     NEW FACES IN THE OLD LEAGUE  BY JOHN B.
10028{_}506{_}FOSTER.
10028{_}507{_}Not for some time has there been such a turning over of the leaves of history in the National League as during 1912-13, and because of this there are many new faces peering out of the album.
10028{_}508{_}There have also been changes in the minor circuits and one prominent change in the American League.
10028{_}509{_}The death of John T. Brush removed from Base Ball a dean of the National League.
10028{_}510{_}Wise in the lore of the game, a man more of the future than of the present, as he always foresaw that which some of his contemporaries were less alert in perceiving, it meant no easy task to be his successor.
10028{_}511{_}Prior to the death of Mr. Brush there was a great deal of curious and some idle speculation as to his ultimate successor in case of decease, or, in the event of his retirement because of bodily weariness.
10028{_}512{_}One or two went so far as to say that upon his death Andrew Freedman would return to prominence in Base Ball, because he was the real owner of the New York club.
10028{_}513{_}Once and for all the writer would like to put the personal stamp of absolute denial on the repeated statements made by certain individuals in New York and Chicago that Andrew Freedman retained the control of the New York club after John T. Brush was reported to have purchased it.
10028{_}514{_}Mr. Freedman retained nothing of the kind.
10028{_}515{_}Not that Mr. Brush objected to him as a partner, but when Mr. Brush purchased the stock he purchased the control outright, although he did request Mr. Freedman to hold a few shares and not give up his personal interest in Base Ball, for Mr. Freedman had a great liking for the game in spite of his stormy career.
10028{_}516{_}The assertions that Mr. Freedman was the real owner and Mr. Brush the nominal owner were made with malicious intent, of which the writer has proof, and through a desire, if possible, to combat the popularity and the success of the Giants.
10028{_}517{_}This digression has been made to call attention to the fact that while rumor was plentiful as to the future control of the Giants Mr. Brush was carefully "grooming" a young man--his son-in-law, Mr. H. Hempstead--to take his place.
10028{_}518{_}To a few it was known that Mr. Hempstead was acquiring such experience and information as would be necessary to assume the control of an undertaking which has grown so big as the organization of the Giants in New York.
10028{_}519{_}The business details of the club have quadrupled and the cares and anxieties of the man at the head have increased in proportion.
10028{_}520{_}The Giants, as successful as they have been under the control of John T. Brush and John J. McGraw, the men who have been the executive heads in both the business and the playing departments of the game, are as susceptible to reverses as if they were the lowliest club in the organization.
10028{_}521{_}It is only by constant and severe application that the club's affairs may be kept at the best pitch.
10028{_}522{_}Mr. Hempstead brings to Base Ball the advantage of youth, a keen business sagacity developed beyond his years, coolness, a disposition that is sunny and not easily ruffled, and a reputation for unvarying fairness and the highest type of business and sport ideals.
10028{_}523{_}Quite a list of qualities, but they are there.
10028{_}524{_}If characteristics of that description fail to maintain the high standard of the New York club, then it will be due to the fact that our standards of business deportment have turned topsy-turvy.
10028{_}525{_}William H. Locke is the new president and part owner of the Philadelphia club.
10028{_}526{_}He and Mr. Hempstead are the "junior" presidents of the league.
10028{_}527{_}There is no necessity for the Editor of the GUIDE to enter into any long and fulsome praise as to William H. Locke.
10028{_}528{_}His career speaks for itself and he speaks for himself.
10028{_}529{_}A young man of the finest attributes, he has brought nothing to the mill of Base Ball to grind except that which was the finest and the cleanest grain.
10028{_}530{_}The writer has known Mr. Locke almost, it seems, from boyhood and esteems him for his worth, not only as one who has administered the affairs of Base Ball with skill and intelligence, but as one who wrote of Base Ball with understanding and excellent taste, for it must not be forgotten that Mr. Locke is a newspaper graduate into the ranks of the great sport the affairs of which fill a little corner of the hearts of so many of America's citizens.
10028{_}531{_}Perhaps no young man ever left a newspaper office to become a Base Ball president with more good wishes behind him than William H. Locke.
10028{_}532{_}He served his apprenticeship as secretary of the Pittsburgh club and he served it well.
10028{_}533{_}He is a high class, delightful young man, every inch of him, and Philadelphia will soon become as proud of him as Pittsburgh is now.
10028{_}534{_}Still another newspaper writer has been claimed from the desk by the National League.
10028{_}535{_}He is Herman Nickerson, formerly sporting editor of the Boston Journal, who is now the secretary of the Boston National League club.
10028{_}536{_}"Nick" is known from one end of the National League circuit to the other as one of the most solid and substantial of the writing force, and also as one of the most demure and modest.
10028{_}537{_}In addition to his great fund of information on Base Ball topics he is an author, and "The Sword of Bussy," a book which was published during the winter, is even more clever than some of the author's best Base Ball yarns, and that is saying a great deal in behalf of a man wedded to Base Ball.
10028{_}538{_}Another change in the National League was the selection of Frank M. Stevens of New York, as one of the Board of Directors of the New York National League club.
10028{_}539{_}This brings into Base Ball one of New York's cleverest and brightest young business men, one who is forging so rapidly to the front in business circles in the big metropolis that many an older head goes to him for advice.
10028{_}540{_}Mr. Stevens knows a lot about Base Ball, which is of even greater importance in the game, and is not afraid to swing any venture that will put with fairness a championship team into the big city.
10028{_}541{_}He is a son of Harry M. Stevens, whom everybody knows, rich and poor alike.
10028{_}542{_}In the American League the death of Mr. Thomas D. Noyes, president of the Washington club, a young man who left behind naught but friends, left a vacancy in the organization which was filled by the selection of Mr. Benjamin S. Minor.
10028{_}543{_}The new president of the club has had practical experience in Base Ball and perhaps plenty of it, as almost everybody has had in Washington, but he is a wideawake, progressive and ambitious man, who is of just the type to keep Base Ball going, now that it has struck its gait in the national capital, and the future of the sport looks all the brighter for his connection with it.
10028{_}544{_}THE UMPIRES   The umpires are always with us, and the umpire problem has been a vexation of Base Ball since the beginning of Base Ball time, yet neither the umpires, the public, the club owners nor the league officials need be discouraged, for it was fully proved in 1912 that umpiring, as a fine art, has advanced a step nearer perfection.
10028{_}545{_}We may well doubt that perfection in its every quality shall ever be achieved, but we may all feel sanguine that it is possible to realize better results.
10028{_}546{_}It is true that some men make better umpires than others, exactly as some men make better ball players than others, but it is also true that if the men who find it the hardest task to become the most expert umpires would be given a little more encouragement they might be a little more successful.
10028{_}547{_}To the staff of umpires of the National League and the American League it is but fair to render a compliment for their work of last season.
10028{_}548{_}Some of them made mistakes but the general average of work on the part of the judges of play was excellent.
10028{_}549{_}There was less tendency on the part of the umpires to render their decisions without being in a position to follow the play correctly.
10028{_}550{_}They were occasionally willing to concede that they might have been wrong when an analysis of the play was brought to their attention and they were firm in asserting discipline without becoming overheated on their own account.
10028{_}551{_}To the mind of the Editor of the GUIDE, in the general light of observation, the most serious blunders committed by the umpires in 1912 were in making decisions before the play took place.
10028{_}552{_}This did happen and more than once.
10028{_}553{_}To illustrate, by an example, the Editor of the GUIDE had exhibited to him some photographs taken during 1912 in which a player had been "waved out" before he actually had arrived at the base.
10028{_}554{_}Granting the desire of the umpires to be alert and ready to render decisions promptly, it is equally apparent that giving decisions in advance of the completion of plays is likely to imbue the spectators with an idea that the umpire is either partisan or incompetent.
10028{_}555{_}Young umpires, in their haste to "make good" in the major leagues, are apt to overdo rather than fail to be on time.
10028{_}556{_}While it is not a pleasant subject to discuss, it is a fact that some umpires had been accustomed to use the very language to players on the field that they were presumed in their official capacity as umpires to correct.
10028{_}557{_}The writer knows of instances where this took place.
10028{_}558{_}It has ever been the policy of the GUIDE to stand for clean and high class Base Ball.
10028{_}559{_}Twenty per cent.
10028{_}560{_}more women attend ball games now than did ten years ago.
10028{_}561{_}Eighty per cent.
10028{_}562{_}more women spectators are likely to attend five years from now.
10028{_}563{_}To encourage their attendance every effort should be made to eliminate all disgraceful conversation on the field.
10028{_}564{_}Wherever it may be ascertained that an umpire has used profane or vulgar language on the field the editor of the GUIDE believes that he should be fined and punished as sternly as an offending player.
10028{_}565{_}It is contended that the position of the umpire has been rendered more arduous by reason of the world's series.
10028{_}566{_}The argument is advanced that the players are more intractable, by reason of their eagerness to play in the post-season games.
10028{_}567{_}That argument would be stronger were it not for the fact that some of the worst disturbances emanate from the players of the clubs that have no chance to play in the world's series.
10028{_}568{_}As a general rule two good reasons may be advanced for disputes on the part of players.
10028{_}569{_}First: Desire to "cover up" the player's own blunder.
10028{_}570{_}Second: General "cussedness."
10028{_}571{_}There are players who make honest objection on the excitement of the moment from sheer desire to win, but their lapses from Base Ball etiquette are so few and far between that their transgressions usually may be forgiven with some grace.
10028{_}572{_}The Editor of the GUIDE would offer one suggestion to league presidents and umpires; it is this: whenever two possible plays occur in conjunction, instruct the chief umpire always to turn to the spectators and inform them which player is out.
10028{_}573{_}For instance, if a player is at bat and another on the bases and two are out and an attempt is made to steal second, as the chief umpire calls the batter out on strikes the public should be clearly informed that the batter is out.
10028{_}574{_}If the play looks close at second base the crowd frequently believes the runner has been called out and resents it accordingly.
10028{_}575{_}In line with the same play, when the runner is called out and the fourth ball at the same time is called on the batter, the chief umpire should turn to the spectators and to the press box and make it clearly understood that the batter has been given a base on balls.
10028{_}576{_}It saves a great deal of annoyance and fault finding.
10028{_}577{_}By the way, although it has been said elsewhere, the Editor of the GUIDE would beg the indulgence of repetition by stating that the work of the umpires during the world's series of 1912 was one of the finest exhibitions of its kind ever seen on a ball field, and somehow it seemed as if the players, would they but deport themselves during all series as they did during the world's series might find that there are more good umpires in the world after all than bad ones.
10028{_}578{_}BASE BALL WRITERS OF THE SOUTH   While the Base Ball writers of the cities which comprise the Southern Association have no organized membership similar to the Base Ball Writers' Association of the major leagues and the organizations which are best known as the class AA leagues, they are a clever, hard-working group of young men, who have labored in season and out of season, not only to build up Base Ball but to build it up on the right lines.
10028{_}579{_}Experience of more than a quarter of a century has most abundantly proved that the standard of Base Ball has steadily been elevated.
10028{_}580{_}It needs no compilation of fact nor any dogmatic assertion on the part of the Editor of the GUIDE to attest that fact.
10028{_}581{_}It is a present condition which speaks for itself.
10028{_}582{_}The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.
10028{_}583{_}In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.
10028{_}584{_}Later there came a season when the commercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the pastime.
10028{_}585{_}This has been repressed in the last two seasons and to-day the morale of Base Ball is of a higher type than it ever has been in the history of the pastime.
10028{_}586{_}It is a high class sport in the main, managed by high class, men for high class purposes.
10028{_}587{_}Going through the early stages of building up a successful league, which, by the way, is the severest of all tasks, and even now at intervals confronted with changes in the league circuit, the Southern writers have steadily been sowing the seeds of high class Base Ball and they have seen results prior to this date, for Base Ball has become popular and has been handsomely and loyally supported in sections in which fifteen years ago it would have been considered impossible to achieve such results.
10028{_}588{_}It is true that business reverses and adverse conditions have had at times their effect upon Base Ball in the South and possibly may produce similar results again, but the admirable offset to this fact is that none of these conditions at any time has daunted the spirit and the resolution of the young men who have zealously been preaching the cause of clean and healthy Base Ball.
10028{_}589{_}Very likely to their zeal, their courage, their tact and their ability it is possible to ascribe the increase in good ball players which is making itself manifest in the South.
10028{_}590{_}More high class and attractive athletes are coming from the Southern states in these days than ever was the case before.
10028{_}591{_}Base Ball is very glad to have them.
10028{_}592{_}When a representative major league team is made up of players who represent every section in the Union, engaged for their skill, it seems as if Base Ball has become nearer an ideal and a national pastime than ever before in the history of the sport.
10028{_}593{_}To the Southern writers the members of the Base Ball Writers Association and those of the organizations patterned on like lines send greeting.
10028{_}594{_}BASE BALL WORTH WHILE?
10028{_}595{_}One of the foremost divines in the East who has a deep concern in Base Ball and Base Ball players is Rev.
10028{_}596{_}Dr. Reisner, pastor of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, of New York City.
10028{_}597{_}Throughout the season he attends the games and is greatly interested in the work of the players.
10028{_}598{_}He knows Base Ball well, and in addition to that he knows the environment of Base Ball players and their character and endeavor as well as any person in the United States.
10028{_}599{_}It is Dr. Reisner's custom each year to preach a sermon to the Base Ball players and their friends in his church in New York, and the building always is filled to listen to his discourse.
10028{_}600{_}In view of the interest which he takes in the national game and because of his excellent knowledge as to the general details of the sport, the Editor of the GUIDE asked him to say a few words to the ball players of the United States through the medium of this publication, and he has graciously consented to do so in the following pithy and straightforward talks:  BY THE REV.
10028{_}601{_}CHRISTIAN F. REISNER, NEW YORK.
10028{_}602{_}The Bible is the Spalding book of rules for the game of life.
10028{_}603{_}James B. Sullivan, beloved by all athletes, gave me these rules for athletes: "Don't drink, use tobacco or dissipate.
10028{_}604{_}Go to bed early and eat wholesome food!"
10028{_}605{_}The boozer gets out of the game as certainly as the bonehead.
10028{_}606{_}I have interviewed scores of the most noted players.
10028{_}607{_}Every one had a religious training.
10028{_}608{_}Many are church members.
10028{_}609{_}All avoid old-time drinking, as our fathers did smallpox.
10028{_}610{_}Mathewson belongs to the high type now being generally duplicated.
10028{_}611{_}He is a modern masculine Christian.
10028{_}612{_}Base Ball demands brains as well as brawn.
10028{_}613{_}Minds muddled by licentiousness and liquor are too "leady" for leaders.
10028{_}614{_}Hotheadedness topples capable players.
10028{_}615{_}I am proud to style scores of Base Ball players, I know, as gentlemen.
10028{_}616{_}They are optimists.
10028{_}617{_}Defect is unrecognized.
10028{_}618{_}Team work makes them brotherly.
10028{_}619{_}Bickerings break a Baseballist.
10028{_}620{_}Every member of the team gives himself wholly to the game.
10028{_}621{_}Jeers are as harmless as cheers.
10028{_}622{_}Every minute he does his best.
10028{_}623{_}He sleeps only at night.
10028{_}624{_}To do these things the player must follow Bible rules.
10028{_}625{_}If he keeps it up life's success is certain.
10028{_}626{_}Governor Tener and Senator Gorman proved it.
10028{_}627{_}No wonder "Billy" Sunday wrote me "I would not take a million dollars for my experience on the ball field."
10028{_}628{_}It taught him how to knock the Devil out of the box.
10028{_}629{_}Base Ball is invaluable to America.
10028{_}630{_}It thrills and so rests tired nerves.
10028{_}631{_}It brings the "shut-in" man into God's healing out-o'-doors.
10028{_}632{_}While yelling he swallows great draughts of lung-expanding, purifying air and forgets the fear of "taking cold."
10028{_}633{_}He is pulled out of self-centeredness, while shouting for another.
10028{_}634{_}He stands crowd jostling good-naturedly or gets his cussedness squeezed out.
10028{_}635{_}He chums up with any one with easy comments and so gets out of his shell and melts again into a real human.
10028{_}636{_}Base Ball absolutely pulls the brain away from business.
10028{_}637{_}It emphasizes the value of decency and gives healthy and high toned recreation to millions.
10028{_}638{_}If kept clean its good-doing cannot be measured.
10028{_}639{_}Nothing is worth while that does not do that.
10028{_}640{_}THE SPALDING BASE BALL HALL OF FAME   (From Spalding's Official Base Ball Record.)
10028{_}641{_}New faces enter into the Spalding Base Ball "Hall of Fame" this year.
10028{_}642{_}The object of this "Hall of Fame" is not necessarily to portray the very top men of each department of the national game, for it frequently happens in these days, when players take part in only a few innings now and then, that they become entitled to mention in the records, although they do not bear the real brunt of the work.
10028{_}643{_}In the "Hall of Fame" will be found the men who might well be termed the "regulars."
10028{_}644{_}Day in and day out they were on the diamond, or ready to take their place on the diamond, if they were not injured.
10028{_}645{_}NATIONAL LEAGUE.
10028{_}646{_}First of all, Daubert has earned his place at first base for the season of 1912.
10028{_}647{_}Threatening in other years to become one of the group of leading players, he performed so well in the season past that there is no doubt as to his right.
10028{_}648{_}There is a new player at second base.
10028{_}649{_}The regularity with which Egan of Cincinnati performed for the Reds earned him a place as the banner second baseman.
10028{_}650{_}At third base the honor goes to J.R. Lobert, the third baseman of the Philadelphia club.
10028{_}651{_}In this particular instance Lobert was crowded, not for efficiency, but in the number of games played by Byrne, third baseman of Pittsburgh, and Herzog, third baseman of New York.
10028{_}652{_}In the matter of chances undertaken on the field, Herzog surpassed both Lobert and Byrne, but, in justice to Lobert, the honor seems to be fairly deserved by him.
10028{_}653{_}John H. Wagner, the brilliant veteran of the Pittsburgh club, fought his way to the position of shortstop in 1912.
10028{_}654{_}His fielding was better than that of his rivals and at times he played the position as only a man of his sterling worth can play.
10028{_}655{_}Owing to the fact that the able secretary of the National League, John A. Heydler, has compiled two methods of comparing pitchers, the "Hall of Fame" in the National League this year will include two faces.
10028{_}656{_}They are those of Hendrix of the Pittsburgh club and Tesreau of the New York club.
10028{_}657{_}The former won the greater percentage of games under the old rule in vogue of allotting percentage upon victories.
10028{_}658{_}Tesreau, however, under a new rule which classifies pitchers by earned runs, easily led the league.
10028{_}659{_}The editor of the RECORD is very much inclined toward Mr. Heydler's earned run record; in fact, has suggested a record based upon the construction of making every pitcher responsible for runs and computing his average upon the percentage of runs for which he is responsible.
10028{_}660{_}That places Tesreau in the front row, with Mathewson second.
10028{_}661{_}There are two catchers who run a close race for the "Hall of Fame" in 1912.
10028{_}662{_}They are Meyers of New York and Gibson of Pittsburgh.
10028{_}663{_}Meyers caught by far the larger number of games, and, basing the work of catcher upon the average chances per game, seems to lead his Pittsburgh rival.
10028{_}664{_}Both men are sterling performers, and Meyers is an instance of the greatest improvement on the part of a catcher of any member of the major leagues.
10028{_}665{_}For the position of leading outfielder, all things considered, Carey of Pittsburgh is selected for the "Hall of Fame."
10028{_}666{_}Not only did he play in the greatest number of games of any outfielder, but his general work in the outfield was sensational.
10028{_}667{_}For the position of leading batsman the "Hall of Fame" honors Zimmerman, the powerful batter of the Chicago club.
10028{_}668{_}His work with the bat in 1912 approached in many ways that of the high class and powerful batters of old.
10028{_}669{_}He batted steadily, with the exception of one very slight slump, and his work as batter undoubtedly was of tremendous assistance to Chicago.
10028{_}670{_}Zimmerman did not shine alone as the best batter, as he was also the leading maker of home runs and the best two-base hitter of the season.
10028{_}671{_}That gives him a triple honor.
10028{_}672{_}The best three-base hitter of the league was the quiet Wilson of Pittsburgh.
10028{_}673{_}Though not so high in rank as a batsman as some of his contemporaries, there was none in the organization who could equal his ability to get to third base on long hits.
10028{_}674{_}Bescher, as in 1911, earned in 1912 the position of leading base runner in the National League.
10028{_}675{_}He stole more bases than any other player of the league, and was also the best run getter--that is to say, scored more runs than any other player.
10028{_}676{_}AMERICAN LEAGUE.
10028{_}677{_}First of all comes Gandil for first base.
10028{_}678{_}His greater number of games played and his steady work at first almost all of the season, as he did not join the Washingtons at the beginning of the season, places him in the "Hall of Fame" at first base.
10028{_}679{_}Rath is a newcomer to the Chicago club, but by all around good work he earned the place at second base.
10028{_}680{_}Not so heavy a batter as some of his rivals, he covered a great amount of ground for the Chicagos and steadied the infield throughout the year.
10028{_}681{_}For the position of shortstop, McBride of Washington is the logical selection.
10028{_}682{_}Day in and day out he was one of the most reliable shortstops in the American League.
10028{_}683{_}At third base John Turner of the Cleveland club retains the honor which he earned for himself in 1911, and he is one of the few players who is a member of the "Hall of Fame" two years in succession.
10028{_}684{_}In the outfield, for all around work, the place of honor goes to Amos Strunk, the young player of the Philadelphia club.
10028{_}685{_}He was in center field and in left field, and he was a busy young man for most of the year.
10028{_}686{_}Pitching at a standard higher than the American League had seen for years, Wood of Boston is given the "Hall of Fame" honor as pitcher.
10028{_}687{_}His average of winning games was very high, and he was compelled to fight hard for many of his victories.
10028{_}688{_}The man who caught him seems entitled to be considered the leading catcher.
10028{_}689{_}He is Cady of Boston, although for hard work Carrigan, also of Boston, gives him a close race.
10028{_}690{_}Once more Cobb is the leading batsman of the American League.
10028{_}691{_}There was none to dispute his right to the title.
10028{_}692{_}He was also leading batsman in 1911 and is another American League player who holds a position in the "Hall" two years in succession.
10028{_}693{_}The leading home run batter of the American League was Baker of Philadelphia.
10028{_}694{_}He earned the same title in 1911.
10028{_}695{_}It is a double "Hall of Fame" distinction for him.
10028{_}696{_}Jackson of Cleveland enters the "Hall of Fame" by being the leading batter for three-base hits.
10028{_}697{_}Speaker of Boston becomes a member of the high honor group by being the leading batter of two-base hits.
10028{_}698{_}Lewis of Boston is the leading batter of sacrifice hits.
10028{_}699{_}Collins of Philadelphia was the best run getter.
10028{_}700{_}Last, but by no means least, of all, Milan, the clever outfielder of Washington, is the best base stealer of the year, and better than all the rest, earns his distinction in joining the "Hall of Fame" by establishing a new record of stolen bases.
10028{_}701{_}JOHN TOMLINSON BRUSH  BY JOHN B.
10028{_}702{_}FOSTER.
10028{_}703{_}John Tomlinson Brush was born in Clintonville, N.Y., on June 15, 1845.
10028{_}704{_}He died November 26, 1912, near St. Charles, Mo., on his way to California from New York, for his health.
10028{_}705{_}Left an orphan at the age of four years, he went to live at the home of his grandfather, in Hopkinton, where he remained until he was seventeen years old.
10028{_}706{_}At this age he left school and went to Boston, where he obtained a position in a clothing establishment, a business with which he was identified up to his death.
10028{_}707{_}He worked as a clerk in several cities in the East, and finally went to Indianapolis in 1875 to open a clothing store.
10028{_}708{_}The store still occupies the same building, and Mr. Brush continued at the head of the business until his death.
10028{_}709{_}It was in the early '80s that he first became interested in Base Ball in Indianapolis, and he made himself both wealthy and famous as a promoter.
10028{_}710{_}In 1863 Mr. Brush enlisted in the First New York Artillery, and served as a member of this body until it was discharged, at the close of the civil war.
10028{_}711{_}He was a charter member of George H. Thomas Post, G.A.R.
10028{_}712{_}; a thirty-third degree Scottish Rite Mason, and was also prominently identified with several social and commercial organizations of Indianapolis, notably the Columbia Club, Commercial Club, Board of Trade, and the Mannerchor Society.
10028{_}713{_}In New York Mr. Brush took up membership in the Lambs' Club and the Larchmont Club.
10028{_}714{_}For several years he made his headquarters at the Lambs' Club.
10028{_}715{_}Mr. Brush is survived by his widow, Mrs. Elsie Lombard Brush, and two daughters, Miss Natalie Brush and Mrs. Harry N. Hempstead.
10028{_}716{_}His first wife, Mrs. Agnes Ewart Brush, died in 1888.
10028{_}717{_}Mr. Brush's career in Base Ball, a sport to which he was devotedly attached, and for which he had the highest ideals and aims, began with the Indianapolis club of the National League.
10028{_}718{_}It has been somewhat inaccurately stated that he entered Base Ball by chance.
10028{_}719{_}This was not, strictly speaking, the case.
10028{_}720{_}Prior to his first immediate association with the national game he was an ardent admirer of the sport, although not connected with it in any capacity as owner.
10028{_}721{_}He was what might be called, with accurate description, a Base Ball "fan" in the earlier stages of development.
10028{_}722{_}An opportunity presented itself by which it was possible to procure for the city of Indianapolis a franchise in the National League.
10028{_}723{_}Mr. Brush was quick to perceive the advantages which this might have in an advertising way for the city with which he had cast his lot and subscribed to the stock.
10028{_}724{_}Like many such adventures in the early history of the sport there came a time when the cares and the duties of the club had to be assumed by a single individual and it was then that he became actively identified as a managing owner, as the duty of caring for the club fell upon his shoulders.
10028{_}725{_}From that date, until the date of his death, he was actively interested in every detail relating to Base Ball which might pertain to the advancement of the sport, and his principal effort in his future participation in the game was to see that it advanced on the lines of the strictest integrity and in such a manner that its foundation should be laid in the rock of permanent success.
10028{_}726{_}Naturally this was bound to bring him into conflict with some who looked upon Base Ball as an idle pastime, in which only the present moment was to be consulted.
10028{_}727{_}The earliest environment of Base Ball was not wholly of a substantial nature.
10028{_}728{_}It was a game, intrinsically good of itself, in which the hazards had always been against the weak.
10028{_}729{_}There was not that consideration of equity which would have been for its best interests, but this was not entirely the fault of the separate members of the Base Ball body, but the result of conditions, in which those whose thought was only for the moment, overshadowed the best interests of the pastime.
10028{_}730{_}There was an inequity in regulations governing the sport by which the clubs in the smaller cities were forced, against the will of their owners, to be the weaker organizations, and possibly this was less due to a desire upon the more fortunate and larger clubs to maintain such a state of affairs, than to the fact that the organization generally had expanded upon lines with little regard to the future.
10028{_}731{_}The first general complaint arose from the players who composed the membership of the smaller clubs.
10028{_}732{_}They demurred at the fact that they were asked to perform equally as well as the players of the clubs in the larger cities at smaller salaries.
10028{_}733{_}Not that they did not try to do their best, for this they stoutly attempted under all conditions.
10028{_}734{_}It was the effect of a discrimination which was the result of the imperfect regulations that existed relative to the management of the game.
10028{_}735{_}This attitude of the players resulted at length in the formation of a body known as the Brotherhood.
10028{_}736{_}To offset not the Brotherhood, but the cause which led to its formation, Mr. Brush devised the famous classification plan.
10028{_}737{_}Imperfectly understood in what it intended to do for the players, it was seized upon as a reason for the revolt of the players and the organization of the Brotherhood League.
10028{_}738{_}At heart it was the idea of Mr. Brush so to equalize salaries that the players of all clubs should be reimbursed in an equitable manner.
10028{_}739{_}As always had been the case, and probably always is likely to be, the players who received the larger salaries were in no mood to share with their weaker brothers any excess margin of pay which they thought that they had justly earned, and it was not a difficult matter for them to obtain the consent of players who might really have benefited by the plan to co-operate with them on the basis of comradeship.
10028{_}740{_}The motives of Mr. Brush were thoroughly misconstrued by some, and, if grasped by others, they were disregarded, because they conflicted with their immediate temporary prosperity.
10028{_}741{_}The dead Base Ball organizer had looked further ahead than his time.
10028{_}742{_}His plan was born under the best of intentions, but it unfortunately devolved upon the theory that players would be willing to share alike for their common good.
10028{_}743{_}Later in life, through another and unquestionably even better method, he succeeded in bringing forth a plan which attained the very end for which he sought in the '80s, but in the second resort, by a far more efficacious method.
10028{_}744{_}The Brotherhood League came into existence and rivaled the National League.
10028{_}745{_}The players of the National League and the American Association deserted to join the Brotherhood League, upon a platform that promised Utopia in Base Ball.
10028{_}746{_}Unquestionably it was the idea of the general Brotherhood organization that the National League would abandon the fight and succumb, but the National League owners were built of sterner stuff.
10028{_}747{_}They fought back resolutely and hard and while for a time they were combated by a fickle opinion, based upon sentiment, it developed within two months that the public had learned thoroughly the reasons for the organization of the new league and declined to lend it that support which had been predicted and expected.
10028{_}748{_}Meanwhile, Base Ball had received a setback greater than any which had befallen the sport in an organized sense from a professional standpoint.
10028{_}749{_}The Brotherhood League was a pronounced and emphatic failure.
10028{_}750{_}This is not the verdict of personal opinion, but a record which is indelibly impressed upon Base Ball history.
10028{_}751{_}It was the theory of the Brotherhood League that it, in part, should be governed by representative players, but the players would not be governed by players.
10028{_}752{_}Discipline relaxed, teams did pretty much as they pleased, and the public remained away from the games.
10028{_}753{_}It may be added with truth that the National League games were not much better patronized, but that was due to the prevalent apathy in Base Ball affairs throughout the United States.
10028{_}754{_}When the Brotherhood League was formed and withdrew so many players from the National League the latter organization undertook to strengthen itself where it could and when Brooklyn and Cincinnati applied for membership in the circuit both were admitted.
10028{_}755{_}The New York National League club had lost many of its players and, upon the substitution of Cincinnati for Indianapolis in the National League circuit, procured from Mr. Brush many players of note, among them Rusie, Glasscock, Buckley, Bassett and Denny.
10028{_}756{_}Relative to the withdrawal of Indianapolis from the circuit it may be said that Mr. Brush flatly refused to give up his club, asserting stoutly that he was perfectly able to continue the fight, but when he felt that the exigencies of the occasion demanded that Cincinnati become a member, he agreed to give up the franchise, providing that he be permitted to retain his membership in the National League, and transfer such of his players as New York desired to the latter city.
10028{_}757{_}It has been alleged that he demanded an exorbitant price from New York for the transfer of the players.
10028{_}758{_}This is untrue.
10028{_}759{_}He asked the price of his franchise, the value of his players, and the worth of giving up a Base Ball year in a city in which there was to be no conflicting club and, as he had expressed full confidence in his ability to make a winning fight for the National League, it was agreed that his rights to be considered could not be overlooked.
10028{_}760{_}To retain his National League membership he accepted stock in the New York club.
10028{_}761{_}Toward the close of the Base Ball season the Brotherhood League dealt what it believed to be a death blow to the National League by the purchase of the Cincinnati franchise.
10028{_}762{_}It proved to be a boomerang, for before the first day of January, 1891, the Brotherhood League had passed out of existence.
10028{_}763{_}The backers of the organization, tired of the general conduct of the sport, were only too willing to come to an acceptable agreement and retire.
10028{_}764{_}A.G. Spalding, John T. Brush, Frank De Hass Robison, Charles H. Byrne and A.H. Soden were prominent members of the National League to bringing this result about.
10028{_}765{_}Of these, Mr. Spalding and Mr. Soden survive, but have retired from active participation in Base Ball affairs.
10028{_}766{_}It was through this settlement, resulting upon the Base Ball war, that Mr. Brush's activities were turned toward Cincinnati.
10028{_}767{_}The National League had a franchise in that city, but no one to operate it.
10028{_}768{_}Mr. Brush agreed to take up the franchise and attempt to operate and rebuild that club.
10028{_}769{_}That, however, is a detail which relates purely to the continuance of a major league circuit.
10028{_}770{_}The next most noticeable achievement in Mr. Brush's Base Ball career and, to the mind of more than one, the greatest successful undertaking in the history of the game, was a complete revolution in the distribution of financial returns.
10028{_}771{_}By his success in effecting this Mr. Brush brought about the very purpose which he had sought to attain by his classification plan.
10028{_}772{_}But the method was better, for the instruments of this readjustment of conditions were the owners and not the players.
10028{_}773{_}Briefly, it was the following:  There was still war in Base Ball between the American Association and the National League.
10028{_}774{_}Recognizing that the best method to bring about a cessation of this war was to effect an amalgamation of the conflicting forces Mr. Brush sought, with the assistance of others, to weld both leagues into one.
10028{_}775{_}He was aided in this task, though indirectly, because A.G. Spalding was actively out of Base Ball, by that gentleman, Frank De Hass Robison, Christopher Von der Abe, and Francis C. Richter, editor of "Sporting Life" of Philadelphia.
10028{_}776{_}The writer also essayed in the task in an advisory capacity.
10028{_}777{_}The amalgamation was brought about, though not without some opposition; indeed, much opposition.
10028{_}778{_}It was conceded at that time that a twelve-club league, which was the object sought, was cumbersome and unwieldy, but there was no other plan of possible accomplishment which suggested itself.
10028{_}779{_}But the principal consideration and the result accomplished in this consolidation of leagues was that all gate receipts should be divided, share and share alike, so far as general admissions were concerned.
10028{_}780{_}That was the greatest and most far-reaching achievement in the history of Base Ball.
10028{_}781{_}Prior to that time the principle of a fixed guarantee for each game played had given each home club a stupendous bulk of the sums paid by the public toward the maintenance of the sport.
10028{_}782{_}The inevitable outcome of such an arrangement was that the clubs in the larger cities completely overshadowed the clubs in the smaller cities.
10028{_}783{_}The teams in the cities of less population were expected to try to place rival organizations on the field that would equal in playing strength those of New York, Boston and Chicago, but they were unable to do so unless their owners were willing to go on year after year with large deficits staring them in the face.
10028{_}784{_}When Mr. Brush and his associates succeeded in placing Base Ball upon a plane of absolute fairness, so far as the proper distribution of the returns of the sport could be made between clubs, Base Ball began to prosper, and, for the first time in all its history, the owners of so-called smaller clubs felt that they could go forward and try to rival their bigger fellows with equally strong combinations.
10028{_}785{_}More than that, and which to the ball player is most important of all, it "jumped" the salaries of the players in the smaller clubs until they were on equal terms with their fellow players in the larger clubs, so that Mr. Brush helped to accomplish by this plan the very aim which he had at heart when he proposed the classification plan--a just, impartial and equal reimbursement to every player in the game, so far as the finances of each club would permit--and without that bane to all players, a salary limit.
10028{_}786{_}Thus, while it is always probable that some players may receive more than others, based upon their preponderance of skill, it is now a fact that two-thirds of the major league ball players of the present day owe their handsome salaries to the system which John T. Brush so earnestly urged and for which he fought against odds which would have daunted a man with less fixity of purpose.
10028{_}787{_}Having brought forth this new condition in Base Ball, which was so just that its results almost immediately began to make themselves manifest, the owner of the Cincinnati club devoted his time and his energies to the endeavor to place a championship club in Cincinnati.
10028{_}788{_}He never was successful in that purpose, although his ill fortune was no greater than that of his predecessors.
10028{_}789{_}The time came that Mr. Brush learned that the New York Base Ball Club could be purchased.
10028{_}790{_}He obtained the stock necessary to make him owner of the New York organization from Mr. Andrew Freedman, but before he did so another Base Ball war had begun between the National League and the American League, a disagreement starting from the simplest of causes, but which, like many another such disagreement, resulted in the most damaging of conditions to the prosperity of the pastime.
10028{_}791{_}As had been the case in the prior war brought about by the organization of the Brotherhood League, Mr. Brush fought staunchly for his rights.
10028{_}792{_}Prominent National League players were taken by the American League clubs, and this brought retaliation.
10028{_}793{_}At length the National League opened negotiations to obtain certain American League players and succeeded in doing so.
10028{_}794{_}Among these were the manager of the Baltimore club, John J. McGraw, who felt that he was acting perfectly within his rights in joining the New York National League club.
10028{_}795{_}Directly upon his acceptance of the management of the New York club Mr. Brush became its owner and the era of prosperity was inaugurated in New York, which was soon enjoyed by every club throughout the United States.
10028{_}796{_}In its first year under the new management the team was not in condition to make a good fight, but the next year it was ready and since then has won four National League championships and one World's Championship.
10028{_}797{_}In the spring of 1911, at the very dawn of the National League season, the grand stand of the New York National League club burned to the ground.
10028{_}798{_}A man less determined would have been overcome by such a blow.
10028{_}799{_}Nothing daunted and while the flames were not yet quenched, Mr. Brush sent for engineers to devise plans for the magnificent stadium which bears his name and which, on the Polo Grounds in New York, is one of the greatest and the most massive monument to professional Base Ball in the world.
10028{_}800{_}In connection with this wonderful new edifice of steel and stone, which is one of the wonders of the new world, it is appropriate to add that two world's series have been played on the field of the Polo Grounds since it has been erected.
10028{_}801{_}The rules for these world's series were formulated and adopted upon the suggestion and by the advice of Mr. Brush and since a regular world's series season has been a feature of Base Ball the national game has progressed with even greater strides than was the case in the past.
10028{_}802{_}At a meeting of the National League the following resolutions were adopted:    _Whereas_, The death of Mr. John T. Brush, president of the New York   National League Base Ball Club, comes as a sad blow to organized   professional Base Ball and particularly to us, his associates in the   National League.
10028{_}803{_}As the dean of organized professional Base Ball, his wise counsel, his   unerring judgment, his fighting qualities and withal his eminent   fairness and integrity in all matters pertaining to the welfare of the   national game will be surely missed.
10028{_}804{_}He was a citizen of sterling worth, of high moral standards and of   correct business principles, and his death is not only a grievous loss   to us, but to the community at large as well.
10028{_}805{_}Be it, therefore,    _Resolved_, That the members of the National League of Professional   Base Ball Clubs, in session to-day, express their profound grief at   the loss of their friend, associate and counsellor and extend to the   members of his bereaved family their sincere sympathy in the great   loss which they have sustained by his death.
10028{_}806{_}Be it further    _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be spread on the records   of the league.
10028{_}807{_}In connection with the death of Mr. Brush, Ben Johnson, president of the American League, said: "Mr. Brush was a power in Base Ball.
10028{_}808{_}He will be missed as much in the American League as in the National League."
10028{_}809{_}More than three hundred friends, relatives, business acquaintances, lodge brothers and Base Ball associates attended the funeral of Mr. Brush, on Friday, November 29, at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Indianapolis.
10028{_}810{_}Fifty or more of Mr. Brush's Base Ball associates and acquaintances, principally from the East, were present.
10028{_}811{_}The service was conducted by the Rev.
10028{_}812{_}Lewis Brown, rector of St. Paul's, and was followed by a Scottish Rite ceremony in charge of William Geake, Sr., of Fort Wayne, acting thrice potent master, and official head of the thirty-third degree in Indiana.
10028{_}813{_}The Scottish Rite delegation numbered more than 150.
10028{_}814{_}There were also in attendance fifty Knights Templars of Rapier Commandery, under the leadership of Eminent Commander E.J.
10028{_}815{_}Scoonover.
10028{_}816{_}The Grand Army of the Republic, the Indianapolis Commercial Club and a number of local and out-of-town clubs and social organizations of which Mr. Brush was a member also were represented.
10028{_}817{_}The Episcopal service was given impressively.
10028{_}818{_}The Rev.
10028{_}819{_}Dr. Brown, in reviewing the life of Mr. Brush, spoke of him as one of the remarkable men of America, who, in his youth, gave no promise of being in later life a national figure.
10028{_}820{_}In the course of his remarks Dr. Brown said:  "The death of John Tomlinson Brush removes from our midst one of the most remarkable men of our generation.
10028{_}821{_}His life was that of a typical American.
10028{_}822{_}He began in the most unpretentious manner and died a figure of national importance.
10028{_}823{_}"He went through the Civil War so quietly that the fact was unknown to some of his most intimate friends.
10028{_}824{_}He was mustered out with honor and entered the business world in Indianapolis.
10028{_}825{_}His labors here put him at the forefront for sagacity, squareness, honorable treatment and generosity.
10028{_}826{_}"His love of sport made him a patron of the national game.
10028{_}827{_}In a perfectly natural way, he went from manager of the local team to proprietor of the New York Giants.
10028{_}828{_}He was a Bismarck in plan and a Napoleon in execution.
10028{_}829{_}His aim was pre-eminence and he won place by the consent of all.
10028{_}830{_}The recent spectacular outpouring of people and colossal financial exhibit in the struggle for the pennant between New York and Boston were but the legitimate outcome of his marvelous skill.
10028{_}831{_}"He was an early member of the Masonic fraternity.
10028{_}832{_}He took his Blue Lodge degree in his native town and to demonstrate his attachment he never removed his membership.
10028{_}833{_}Where he had been raised to the sublime degree of a master there he wished to keep his affiliation always.
10028{_}834{_}"He became a Knight Templar in Rapier Commandery and was one of its past eminent commanders.
10028{_}835{_}He was a member of the Scottish Rite bodies in the Valley of Indianapolis in the early days and performed his work with a ritual perfection unsurpassed.
10028{_}836{_}He received the thirty-third and last degree as a merited honor for proficiency and zeal.
10028{_}837{_}"The conspicuous feature of his life was its indomitable purpose."
10028{_}838{_}THE WORLD'S SERIES OF 1912  BY JOHN B.
10028{_}839{_}FOSTER.
10028{_}840{_}No individual, whether player, manager, owner, critic or spectator, who went through the world's series of 1912 ever will forget it.
10028{_}841{_}There never was another like it.
10028{_}842{_}Years may elapse before there shall be a similar series and it may be that the next to come will be equally sensational, perhaps more so.
10028{_}843{_}Viewed from the very strict standpoint that all Base Ball games should be played without mistake or blunder this world's series may be said to have been inartistic, but it is only the hypercritical theorist who would take such a cold-blooded view of the series.
10028{_}844{_}From the lofty perch of the "bleacherite" it was a series crammed with thrills and gulps, cheers and gasps, pity and hysteria, dejection and wild exultation, recrimination and adoration, excuse and condemnation, and therefore it was what may cheerfully be called "ripping good" Base Ball.
10028{_}845{_}There were plays on the field which simply lifted the spectators out of their seats in frenzy.
10028{_}846{_}There were others which caused them to wish to sink through the hard floor of the stand in humiliation.
10028{_}847{_}There were stops in which fielders seemed to stretch like india rubber and others in which they shriveled like parchment which has been dried.
10028{_}848{_}There were catches of fly balls which were superhuman and muffs of fly balls which were "superawful."
10028{_}849{_}There were beautiful long hits, which threatened to change the outcome of games and some of them did.
10028{_}850{_}There were opportunities for other beautiful long hits which were not made.
10028{_}851{_}No ingenuity of stage preparation, no prearranged plot of man, no cunningly devised theory of a world's series could have originated a finale equal to that of the eighth and decisive contest.
10028{_}852{_}Apparently on the verge of losing the series after the Saturday game in Boston the Giants had gamely fought their way to a tie with Boston, and it was one of the pluckiest and gamest fights ever seen in a similar series, and just as the golden apple seemed about to drop into the hands of the New York players they missed it because Dame Fortune rudely jostled them aside.
10028{_}853{_}As a matter of fact the New York players were champions of the world for nine and one half innings, for they led Boston when the first half of the extra inning of the final game was played.
10028{_}854{_}Within the next six minutes they had lost all the advantage which they had gained.
10028{_}855{_}It was a combination of bad fielding and lack of fielding which cost the New York team its title.
10028{_}856{_}And if only Mathewson had not given Yerkes a base on balls in the tenth inning the game might not have been won, even with the fielding blunders, but Mathewson was pitching with all the desperation and the cunning which he could muster to fool the batter and failed to do so.
10028{_}857{_}Such sudden and complete reversal on the part of the mental demeanor of spectators was never before seen on a ball field in a world's series.
10028{_}858{_}The Boston enthusiasts had given up and were willing to concede the championship to New York.
10028{_}859{_}In the twinkling of an eye there was a muffed fly, a wonderful catch by the same player who muffed the ball--Snodgrass--a base on balls to Yerkes, a missed chance to retire Speaker easily on a foul fly, then a base hit by Speaker to right field, on which Engel scored, another base on balls to Lewis and then the long sacrifice fly to right field by Gardner, which sent Yerkes over the plate with the winning run.
10028{_}860{_}Before entering upon a description of the games it is appropriate to say that the umpiring in this series was as near perfection as it could be.
10028{_}861{_}It was by far the best of any since the series had been inaugurated.
10028{_}862{_}The umpires were William Klem and Charles Rigler of the National League and Frank O'Loughlin and William Evans of the American League.
10028{_}863{_}FIRST GAME New York, Oct. 8, 1912.
10028{_}864{_}Boston 4, New York 3.
10028{_}865{_}Hits--Off Wood 8; off Tesreau 5; Crandall 1.
10028{_}866{_}Struck out--Wood 11; Tesreau 4; Crandall 2.
10028{_}867{_}Bases on balls--Wood 2; Tesreau 4.
10028{_}868{_}Attendance 35,722.
10028{_}869{_}In the description of the games of the world's series only those innings will be touched upon in which there were men on bases.
10028{_}870{_}Tesreau pitched the opening game for New York and the first man to bat for Boston was Hooper.
10028{_}871{_}Tesreau gave him a base on balls.
10028{_}872{_}The next three batters were retired in succession.
10028{_}873{_}Devore and Doyle, the first two batters for New York, were retired and Snodgrass hit cleanly to center field, the first base hit in the series.
10028{_}874{_}Murray was given a base on balls, but Merkle flied to short.
10028{_}875{_}In the second inning the Bostons started as bravely as they had in the first, as Gardner, the first batter, was safe on Fletcher's fumble.
10028{_}876{_}Stahl batted to Tesreau and Gardner was forced out.
10028{_}877{_}Wagner was given a base on balls, after Stahl had been thrown out trying to steal second, and Cady flied to Murray.
10028{_}878{_}The Bostons started with a man on base in the third.
10028{_}879{_}Wood was given a base on balls by Tesreau and Hooper sacrificed.
10028{_}880{_}Doyle threw Yerkes out and Speaker was given a base on balls, but Lewis died easily on a weak fly to short.
10028{_}881{_}In New York's half of this inning the Giants scored twice.
10028{_}882{_}Tesreau, first at bat, struck out.
10028{_}883{_}Devore was given a base on balls and Doyle batted wickedly to left field for two bases.
10028{_}884{_}Snodgrass was fooled into striking out, but Murray smashed the ball to center field for a single, and sent two men over the rubber, Murray was caught at second trying to get around the bases while Doyle was going home.
10028{_}885{_}With one out Herzog hit safely in the fourth inning, but did not score.
10028{_}886{_}In the fifth, with two out, Doyle batted safely, but failed to score.
10028{_}887{_}In the sixth the Bostons made their first runs on Speaker's triple to left field and Lewis' out.
10028{_}888{_}If Snodgrass, in making a desperate effort to catch the fly, had permitted the ball to go to Devore the chances are that Speaker's hit would have resulted in an out, so that New York lost on the play.
10028{_}889{_}Snodgrass was safe in the sixth on Wagner's fumble, but was doubled off first when Murray drove a line hit straight to Stahl.
10028{_}890{_}The seventh was the undoing of the Giants.
10028{_}891{_}With one out Wagner batted safely to center field.
10028{_}892{_}Cady followed with another hit to the same place.
10028{_}893{_}Wood batted to Doyle, who made a beautiful stop, but with a double play in hand, was overbalanced and unable to complete it.
10028{_}894{_}That cost New York three runs, although it was unavoidable.
10028{_}895{_}Cady was forced out, but Hooper hit to right field for two bases sending Wagner and Wood home.
10028{_}896{_}Yerkes followed with a clean hit to left field for a base and won the first game for Boston with that hit.
10028{_}897{_}In New York's half of the inning, with one out, Meyers was hit by a pitched ball, but no damage was done other than to Meyers' feelings.
10028{_}898{_}In the ninth Wagner batted Crandall for a two-base hit, Crandall having been substituted for Tesreau in the eighth inning, as McCormick had batted for Tesreau in the seventh.
10028{_}899{_}Cady made a sacrifice, but the next two batters were easily retired.
10028{_}900{_}Then began the exciting finish, and if the Giants had made but a single more they probably would have begun the series with a victory instead of a defeat.
10028{_}901{_}With one out Merkle batted the ball over second base for a single and the spectators, who had started toward the exits, halted.
10028{_}902{_}Herzog followed with a slow low fly to right field, which fell safely.
10028{_}903{_}Meyers crashed into the ball for a two-bagger that struck the wall in right field and the crowd began to believe that Wood had gone up in "smoke."
10028{_}904{_}The Boston players encouraged him with all their best vocal efforts, and when Fletcher came to the plate Wood was using all the speed with which he was possessed.
10028{_}905{_}It was evident that Fletcher's sole desire was to bat the ball safely to right field, for if he did so, both of the runners could cross the plate and the Giants would win.
10028{_}906{_}Twice he met the ball, and both times it sailed in the right direction, but with no result, as it was foul.
10028{_}907{_}Then he struck out.
10028{_}908{_}Crandall, perhaps one of the best pinch hitters in the major leagues, also struck out, and the Boston enthusiasts who were present fell back in their chairs from sheer exhaustion, but when they had recovered, with their band leading them, marched across the field and cheered Mayor Fitzgerald of Boston, who was present as a spectator of the contest in company with Mayor Gaynor of New York.
10028{_}909{_}Governor Foss of Massachusetts was also present at the opening of the game.
10028{_}910{_}Klem umpired behind the bat in this game.
10028{_}911{_}SECOND GAME Boston, Oct. 9, 1912.
10028{_}912{_}New York 6.
10028{_}913{_}Boston 6 (eleven innings).
10028{_}914{_}Hits--Off Collins 9, off Hall 2; Mathewson 10.
10028{_}915{_}Struck out--Collins 5, Bedient 1; Mathewson 4 Bases on balls--Hall 4, Bedient 1.
10028{_}916{_}Attendance 30,148.
10028{_}917{_}In the second game of the series, which was played October 9 at Boston, Mathewson pitched for the New York team and Collins, Hall and Bedient for Boston.
10028{_}918{_}The game resulted in a tie, 6 to 6, at the end of the eleventh inning, being called on account of darkness by Umpire O'Loughlin, who was acting behind the plate.
10028{_}919{_}This contest was remarkable more for the misplays of the New York players, which gave the Bostons a chance to save themselves from defeat, than for any undue familiarity with the pitching of Mathewson.
10028{_}920{_}It was the universal opinion of partisans of both teams that Mathewson deserved to win because he outpitched his opponents.
10028{_}921{_}The weather was fair and the ground in excellent condition.
10028{_}922{_}In the first inning Snodgrass began with a clean two-base hit into the left field seats but neither Doyle, Becker nor Murray was able to help him across the plate.
10028{_}923{_}A run scored in that inning, with such a fine start, would probably have won the game for the Giants.
10028{_}924{_}In Boston's half Hooper hit safely to center field and stole second base.
10028{_}925{_}Yerkes batted a line drive to Fletcher, and had the New York shortstop held the ball, which was not difficult to catch, Hooper could easily have been doubled at second, but Fletcher muffed it.
10028{_}926{_}Speaker hit safely toward third base, filling the bases.
10028{_}927{_}Lewis batted to Herzog, who made a fine play on the ball and caught Hooper at the plate.
10028{_}928{_}This should have been the third out and would have retired Boston without a run.
10028{_}929{_}Gardner was put out by a combination play on the part of Mathewson, Doyle and Merkle, scoring Yerkes, and Stahl came through with a hard line hit for a base, which scored Speaker and Lewis.
10028{_}930{_}The inning netted Boston three runs, which were not earned.
10028{_}931{_}With one out in the second inning Herzog batted for three bases to center field and scored on Meyers' single.
10028{_}932{_}Fletcher flied out and Mathewson forced Meyers out.
10028{_}933{_}Hooper got a two-base hit in the same inning, but two were out at the time and Fletcher easily threw out Yerkes, who was the next batter.
10028{_}934{_}In the fourth inning Murray began with a clean three-base hit to center field.
10028{_}935{_}Merkle fouled out to the third baseman, but Herzog's long fly to Speaker was an excellent sacrifice and Murray scored.
10028{_}936{_}Meyers again hit for a single, but was left on the bases.
10028{_}937{_}The Bostons got this run back in the last half of the fifth.
10028{_}938{_}With one out Hooper hit to center field for a base, his third hit in succession against Mathewson.
10028{_}939{_}Yerkes batted a three-bagger out of the reach of Snodgrass and Hooper scored.
10028{_}940{_}Murray batted safely in the sixth, with one out, but died trying to steal second, Carrigan catching for Boston.
10028{_}941{_}In the Boston's half of the sixth Lewis began with a single and got as far as third base, but could not score.
10028{_}942{_}The Giants started bravely in the seventh when Herzog hit the ball for a base and stole second.
10028{_}943{_}There were three chances to get him home, but Meyers, who had been hitting Collins hard, failed to make a single and Fletcher and Mathewson were both retired.
10028{_}944{_}In the eighth the New York players made one of the game rallies for which they became famed all through the series and went ahead of their rivals.
10028{_}945{_}Snodgrass was the first batter and lifted an easy fly to Lewis.
10028{_}946{_}The Boston player got directly under the ball and made a square muff of it.
10028{_}947{_}Doyle followed along with a sharp hit to center field for a base and although he was forced out by Becker, the latter drove the ball hard.
10028{_}948{_}Murray came through with a long two-bagger to left center and Snodgrass and Becker scored.
10028{_}949{_}That tied the score and also put an end to Collins' work in the box; Stahl took him out and substituted Hall.
10028{_}950{_}Merkle fouled weakly to the catcher, but Herzog caught the ball on the nose and hit sharp and clean to center field for two bases, sending Murray home with the run which put the Giants in the lead.
10028{_}951{_}Another base hit would have won for New York, but Meyers perished on a hard hit to Wagner, which was fielded to first ahead of the batter.
10028{_}952{_}Unfortunately for New York, with two out in the last half of the inning Lewis batted the ball to left field for two bases.
10028{_}953{_}Murray made a desperate effort to get it.
10028{_}954{_}He tumbled backward over the fence into the bleachers and for a few moments there were some who thought that he had been seriously injured.
10028{_}955{_}Gardner followed with a single to center and Stahl hit to right for a base, but Wagner struck out and the Bostons were down with only a run.
10028{_}956{_}In the ninth Hall gave a remarkable exhibition.
10028{_}957{_}Fletcher and Mathewson were retired in succession.
10028{_}958{_}Then Snodgrass, Doyle and Becker were given bases on balls, filling the bags.
10028{_}959{_}It seemed certain that a run might score, and perhaps one would have scored had it not been for an excellent stop by Wagner.
10028{_}960{_}Murray hit the ball at him like a shot, but he got it and retired Becker at second.
10028{_}961{_}The Giants took the lead in the tenth and once more it appeared as if the game would be theirs.
10028{_}962{_}Merkle began with a long three-base hit to center field.
10028{_}963{_}Herzog batted to Wagner and Merkle played safe, refusing to try to score while the batter was being put out at first.
10028{_}964{_}Meyers was given a base on balls and Shafer ran for him.
10028{_}965{_}Fletcher lifted a long fly to left field and Merkle scored from third.
10028{_}966{_}Mathewson could not advance the runners and died on an infield fly.
10028{_}967{_}Yerkes was the first batter for the Bostons and was retired at first base.
10028{_}968{_}Speaker hit to deep center field.
10028{_}969{_}There were some scorers who gave the batter but three bases on the hit, insisting that Wilson, who was then catching for New York, should have got the throw to the plate and retired the batter.
10028{_}970{_}In any event Wilson missed the ball and Speaker scored.
10028{_}971{_}Lewis followed with a two-bagger, which would have scored Speaker if the latter had not tried to run home, so Wilson's failure to retrieve the throw became more conspicuous.
10028{_}972{_}Other scorers gave Speaker a clean home run and it is not far out of the way to say that he deserved the benefit of the doubt.
10028{_}973{_}Neither team scored in the eleventh inning, although Snodgrass was hit by a pitched ball.
10028{_}974{_}He was the first batter.
10028{_}975{_}He tried to steal second, but failed to make it.
10028{_}976{_}This contest was conspicuous because of the wonderfully good fielding of Doyle and Wagner.
10028{_}977{_}The former made two stops along the right field line which seemed to be not far from superhuman.
10028{_}978{_}Wagner killed at least two safe hits over second base for New York and both of the plays were of the greatest benefit to the Boston team.
10028{_}979{_}THIRD GAME.
10028{_}980{_}Boston, Oct. 10, 1912.
10028{_}981{_}New York 2; Boston 1.
10028{_}982{_}Hits--Off Marquard 7; O'Brien 6, Bedient 1.
10028{_}983{_}Struck out--Marquard 6, O'Brien 3.
10028{_}984{_}Bases on balls--Marquard 1; O'Brien 3.
10028{_}985{_}Attendance 34,624.
10028{_}986{_}Because of the tie game the teams remained over in Boston and played on the following day, October 10.
10028{_}987{_}The pitchers were Marquard for New York and O'Brien and Bedient for Boston.
10028{_}988{_}Marquard pitched one of the best games of his career and not a run was made against him until the ninth inning.
10028{_}989{_}By far the most notable play of the game on the field was made by Devore in the ninth inning, when he ran for more than thirty feet and caught an almost impossible fly ball which had been batted by Cady.
10028{_}990{_}Had he missed it the Bostons might have scored two runs and won.
10028{_}991{_}Devore began the first inning with a base hit, but was out trying to steal second.
10028{_}992{_}The next two batters were retired.
10028{_}993{_}In the second inning Murray batted the ball to center field for two bases.
10028{_}994{_}Merkle's clever sacrifice put him on third and Herzog's sacrifice fly sent him over the rubber.
10028{_}995{_}Lewis began the inning for Boston with a safe hit, but could not advance further than second.
10028{_}996{_}In the third Fletcher started with a base on balls and was sacrificed to second, but was unable to score.
10028{_}997{_}In the fourth, with one out, Speaker batted safely, but was forced out at second.
10028{_}998{_}Gardner flied to Murray.
10028{_}999{_}In the fifth Herzog began with a two-base hit to left field.
10028{_}1000{_}Meyers died at first, but Fletcher hit safely to right field and Herzog scored.
10028{_}1001{_}Fletcher stole second and Marquard was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1002{_}Devore forced him out and stole second and Doyle followed with another base on balls.
10028{_}1003{_}A long hit would have made the game easy for New York and Snodgrass tried to get the ball into the bleachers, but Lewis caught it.
10028{_}1004{_}Stahl began the Bostons' half of the fifth with a hit, but was out by ten feet trying to steal second.
10028{_}1005{_}In the sixth, with two out, Yerkes hit safely, but Speaker fouled out.
10028{_}1006{_}In the seventh, with two out, Stahl batted the ball to left field for two bases, but Wagner flied to Devore.
10028{_}1007{_}In the eighth the Giants looked dangerous again.
10028{_}1008{_}Devore began with a base-hit to left field.
10028{_}1009{_}Doyle flied to Lewis.
10028{_}1010{_}Snodgrass hit safely to left field and Murray flied to Lewis.
10028{_}1011{_}Merkle batted the ball very hard, but Wagner made a good stop and caught Snodgrass at second.
10028{_}1012{_}With two out Hooper got a base on balls for Boston, but it did Boston no good.
10028{_}1013{_}In the ninth Herzog was hit by a pitched ball and Meyers swung solidly to center for a single, after Herzog had died trying to steal.
10028{_}1014{_}Fletcher lined to Speaker and Meyers was doubled.
10028{_}1015{_}In Boston's half, with one out, Lewis batted to right field for a base.
10028{_}1016{_}Gardner hit to the same place for two bases and Lewis scored Boston's only run.
10028{_}1017{_}Stahl rapped a grounder to Marquard, who threw Gardner out at third.
10028{_}1018{_}Wagner should have been an easy out, and the game would have been over if Merkle had not dropped a throw to first base.
10028{_}1019{_}Wagner stole second, no attention being paid to him, and then Devore made his wonderfully good catch of Cady's hard drive and the Giants had won their first game in the series.
10028{_}1020{_}Marquard outpitched both of his Boston rivals and in only two innings were the Bostons able to get the first man on the bases.
10028{_}1021{_}FOURTH GAME.
10028{_}1022{_}New York, Oct. 11, 1912.
10028{_}1023{_}Boston 3, New York 1.
10028{_}1024{_}Hits--Off Wood 9; off Tesreau 5, Ames 3.
10028{_}1025{_}Struck out--Wood 8; Tesreau 5.
10028{_}1026{_}Bases on balls--Ames 1, Tesreau 2.
10028{_}1027{_}Attendance 36,502.
10028{_}1028{_}The fourth game of the series was played in New York on the following day.
10028{_}1029{_}For most of the forenoon it looked as if there would be no game because of rain.
10028{_}1030{_}Toward noon it cleared up slightly and although the ground was a little soft it was decided to play, in view of the fact that so many spectators had come a long distance to witness the contest.
10028{_}1031{_}The soft ground was in favor of the Boston players, for the ball was batted very hard by New York most of the afternoon, but the diamond held and the infielders were able to get a good grasp on grounders which would ordinarily have been very difficult to handle.
10028{_}1032{_}Tesreau pitched for New York and Wood for Boston, as was the case in the opening game of the series.
10028{_}1033{_}Hooper, who batted with much success on the Polo Grounds, began with a single to center and although Yerkes was safe on Meyers' wild throw the Giants got out of a bad predicament handily because of the excellent stops which were made by Fletcher of hits by Speaker and Lewis.
10028{_}1034{_}With one out in New York's half of the inning Doyle batted safely, but Snodgrass forced him out.
10028{_}1035{_}Gardner began the second inning with a three-base hit to right field and scored on a wild pitch.
10028{_}1036{_}The next three batters were retired in order.
10028{_}1037{_}With one out for New York, Merkle singled and stole second, but was not helped to get home.
10028{_}1038{_}The third was started by a single by Wood and Hooper was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1039{_}Yerkes bunted and Tesreau whipped the ball to third base ahead of Wood.
10028{_}1040{_}Doyle and Fletcher made two fine stops and Speaker and Lewis were retired.
10028{_}1041{_}Boston added another run in the fourth inning, being assisted by Tesreau's wildness.
10028{_}1042{_}Gardner, who batted first, was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1043{_}Stahl forced him out at second.
10028{_}1044{_}Then Stahl stole second, to the immediate surprise of the Boston players and the chagrin of the New York catcher.
10028{_}1045{_}Wagner's out at first helped him along and when Cady pushed a weak single to center field, just out of the reach of the players, Stahl scored.
10028{_}1046{_}Wood was retired by Murray.
10028{_}1047{_}With one out in the fifth Yerkes batted for a base, but was thrown out at second on Speaker's grounder and Speaker died trying to steal.
10028{_}1048{_}New York had one out in the same inning, when Herzog hit safely, but neither Meyers nor Fletcher could help him.
10028{_}1049{_}In the sixth the New York players began with a rush.
10028{_}1050{_}Tesreau, the first batter, hit for a base.
10028{_}1051{_}Devore followed with another single.
10028{_}1052{_}Doyle with a "clean up" could have won for the Giants, but he lifted a high fly to Yerkes.
10028{_}1053{_}Snodgrass batted to Yerkes, who made an extraordinarily good stop and threw Devore out at second.
10028{_}1054{_}Murray forced Snodgrass at second and all.
10028{_}1055{_}New York's early advantage went for naught.
10028{_}1056{_}In the seventh the Giants scored their only run.
10028{_}1057{_}After Merkle had struck out, Herzog batted for a base.
10028{_}1058{_}Meyers lifted a terrific line drive to center field, but Speaker got under the ball.
10028{_}1059{_}Fletcher hit hard and safe to right field for two bases and Herzog scored.
10028{_}1060{_}McCormick batted for a base, but Fletcher, trying to score on the ball, was thrown out at the plate by Yerkes.
10028{_}1061{_}In the eighth, with two out, Snodgrass was safe on Wagner's fumble.
10028{_}1062{_}Murray rapped a single to left field but Merkle struck out.
10028{_}1063{_}With two out for Boston Speaker batted a double to left field and was left.
10028{_}1064{_}Ames pitched in the eighth for New York.
10028{_}1065{_}In the ninth the Giants were scored upon again when Gardner hit for a single to center field.
10028{_}1066{_}Stahl sacrificed, Wagner was given a base on balls and Cady forced Wagner, while Gardner was scoring.
10028{_}1067{_}FIFTH GAME.
10028{_}1068{_}Boston, Oct. 12.
10028{_}1069{_}1912.
10028{_}1070{_}Boston 2; New York 1.
10028{_}1071{_}Hits--Off Mathewson 5; Bedient 3.
10028{_}1072{_}Struck out--Mathewson 2; Bedient 4.
10028{_}1073{_}Bases on balls--Bedient 3.
10028{_}1074{_}Attendance 34,683.
10028{_}1075{_}The game was played on Saturday with Mathewson in the box for New York and Bedient for Boston.
10028{_}1076{_}As was the case in the former game pitched by Mathewson in Boston, the verdict was general that perfect support would have won the contest for him, even though the score was but 2 to 1 in favor of Boston.
10028{_}1077{_}Devore received a base on balls in the first inning and after Doyle was out on a long fly to right was forced out by Snodgrass in a double play.
10028{_}1078{_}By the way this game was played under very adverse conditions so far as the weather was concerned.
10028{_}1079{_}It was cold and gloomy.
10028{_}1080{_}Hooper, the first Boston batter, as usual, began with his single to center field.
10028{_}1081{_}Yerkes flied out to shortstop.
10028{_}1082{_}Speaker hit safely and Lewis batted to Herzog, who made a beautiful stop on third, and touched the base ahead of Hooper.
10028{_}1083{_}Gardner struck out.
10028{_}1084{_}In the second inning Murray started off with a base on balls and the next three batters were retired in succession.
10028{_}1085{_}With one out for Boston, Wagner batted safely to right field.
10028{_}1086{_}The next two men were retired without reaching first.
10028{_}1087{_}With one out in the third, Mathewson batted a single to center field and Devore followed with a base on balls, but Bedient got the next two batters.
10028{_}1088{_}The third was the inning which broke the backs of the Giants.
10028{_}1089{_}Hooper batted the ball to left center for three bases.
10028{_}1090{_}Yerkes followed with a triple to center and Hooper scored.
10028{_}1091{_}Speaker contributed with a ground hit, which Doyle should have got, but fumbled.
10028{_}1092{_}Had he recovered the ball Boston would have made but one run in the inning.
10028{_}1093{_}As it was, Yerkes scored on the misplay and that run lost the game for the Giants.
10028{_}1094{_}The next two batters were retired and for the remainder of the contest Boston never had a man on first base, Mathewson pitching marvelous ball, by far the best game of the series, as it should easily have been a one run contest with not a base on balls nor a wild pitch.
10028{_}1095{_}In the seventh inning Merkle began with a two-base hit to left field Herzog flied out to Wagner.
10028{_}1096{_}Meyers flied out, but McCormick who batted for Fletcher, made a hit and Merkle scored.
10028{_}1097{_}That spurt gave the Giants their sole run and they returned to New York that night with the series three to one against them.
10028{_}1098{_}SIXTH GAME.
10028{_}1099{_}New York, Oct. 14, 1912 New York 5; Boston 2.
10028{_}1100{_}Hits--Off Marquard 7; O'Brien 6, Collins 5.
10028{_}1101{_}Struck out--Marquard 3; O'Brien 1, Collins 1.
10028{_}1102{_}Bases on balls--Marquard 1.
10028{_}1103{_}Attendance 30,622.
10028{_}1104{_}With a Sunday in which to rest the series was resumed in New York on Monday, October 14.
10028{_}1105{_}Marquard pitched for the Giants and O'Brien for the Bostons.
10028{_}1106{_}Rest seemed to have recuperated the New York players more than their opponents.
10028{_}1107{_}In the first inning of the game the Giants scored five runs and the contest was never in doubt after that.
10028{_}1108{_}O'Brien made a costly balk in the first inning and the Boston players generally seemed to be less energetic and less confident than would have been expected from a team which had but one game to win to make the championship assured.
10028{_}1109{_}The first inning really settled the outcome of the contest.
10028{_}1110{_}After the Giants had made five runs Boston played through the other eight innings perfunctorily.
10028{_}1111{_}The crowd of Boston enthusiasts, which had come to New York to see the finishing touches put on the Giants, was bitterly disappointed, while the New York enthusiasts, not over hopeful on account of the disposition of the Giants to blunder badly at vital moments, were at least in a much better frame of mind because of the rally by their team.
10028{_}1112{_}Hooper was first at bat and as usual hit for a base.
10028{_}1113{_}He was caught napping off first.
10028{_}1114{_}Yerkes was easily retired.
10028{_}1115{_}Speaker was given a base on balls and Lewis flied out.
10028{_}1116{_}In New York's half Devore was retired at first.
10028{_}1117{_}Doyle hit safely to center field.
10028{_}1118{_}He stole second after Snodgrass struck out.
10028{_}1119{_}Murray batted a single to left field and Doyle went to third.
10028{_}1120{_}O'Brien made a palpable balk and Doyle scored from third, Murray going to second.
10028{_}1121{_}Merkle banged a hard double to right field, Herzog followed with a double to left field, Meyers singled to left field, and actually stole second under the noses of the Boston players.
10028{_}1122{_}Fletcher singled to right field and Meyers scored the fifth run of the inning; the other men who had crossed the plate being Doyle, Murray, Merkle and Herzog.
10028{_}1123{_}In Boston's half of the second inning the Boston players scored twice and that was all they made in the game.
10028{_}1124{_}Gardner was safe at first on Marquard's wild throw; Stahl singled to center.
10028{_}1125{_}The next two batters were easily retired, but Engle, who batted for O'Brien, hit to left field for two bases, Devore missing the ball by pushing it away from him as he was running into it, and Gardner and Stahl scored.
10028{_}1126{_}Boston began the third inning and the fourth inning with singles, but the runners failed to get around.
10028{_}1127{_}In the eighth, with one out, Yerkes made a single, but was unable to score.
10028{_}1128{_}With one out in the third for New York, Murray singled to right field, but was out trying to stretch the hit.
10028{_}1129{_}Merkle hit for a base to left field and was out trying to steal.
10028{_}1130{_}In the fourth, with one out, Meyers batted to left field for three bases, but was unable to score.
10028{_}1131{_}These latter hits were made against Collins, who had taken O'Brien's place in the box.
10028{_}1132{_}Devore began the fifth with a hit, but Doyle flied to short, and Devore was doubled off first in a play from right field.
10028{_}1133{_}Collins continued to be effective in the next three innings, but the mischief had been done, so far as Boston was concerned, and the Red Sox simply did not have a rally in them.
10028{_}1134{_}The teams again took a special train for Boston after the game and the remainder of the cavalcade followed over at midnight.
10028{_}1135{_}SEVENTH GAME.
10028{_}1136{_}Boston, Oct. 15, 1912.
10028{_}1137{_}New York 11; Boston 4.
10028{_}1138{_}Hits--Off Tesreau 9; Wood 7, Hall 9.
10028{_}1139{_}Struck-out--Tesreau 6; Hall 1.
10028{_}1140{_}Bases on balls--Hall 5; Tesreau 5.
10028{_}1141{_}Attendance 32,630.
10028{_}1142{_}The seventh game was played on Fenway Park, with Wood pitching for Boston and Tesreau for the Giants.
10028{_}1143{_}Wood pitched for one inning and was hammered in every direction by the New York players, who ran riot on the field.
10028{_}1144{_}They simply overwhelmed Boston and this contest, more than any other in the series, was so "one sided" as to be devoid of interest, except to the New York fans, who were eager to see the Giants win the championship.
10028{_}1145{_}Devore, the first batter, hit safely to left field.
10028{_}1146{_}Doyle rapped a single to center.
10028{_}1147{_}Devore and Doyle made a double steal and that began the fireworks.
10028{_}1148{_}Snodgrass pushed a double to right field.
10028{_}1149{_}Murray's hit was a sacrifice.
10028{_}1150{_}Merkle singled to center field.
10028{_}1151{_}Herzog batted to Wood and Merkle was run down between second and third.
10028{_}1152{_}Meyers singled to left field, Fletcher doubled to right field, and Tesreau made his first hit of the series, a single to left field.
10028{_}1153{_}That counted all told six runs for the Giants and Tesreau added cruelty to the sufferings of the Red Sox by trying to steal second base and almost making it.
10028{_}1154{_}In the second inning Gardner made a home run.
10028{_}1155{_}Hall took the place of Wood in the box for Boston and Devore was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1156{_}He stole second and Doyle got a base on balls.
10028{_}1157{_}Devore was caught napping, but Snodgrass singled to right, scoring Doyle.
10028{_}1158{_}The two next batters were retired.
10028{_}1159{_}In the third Hall was safe on Fletcher's wild throw and Hooper singled but neither scored.
10028{_}1160{_}Herzog and Meyers began with singles for New York, but neither of them got home.
10028{_}1161{_}With one out in the fourth, Gardner was hit by a pitched ball and Stahl singled to left field.
10028{_}1162{_}Neither of these players scored.
10028{_}1163{_}In the fifth Hall began with a two-bagger to left.
10028{_}1164{_}Hooper was given a base on balls and was forced out by Yerkes.
10028{_}1165{_}Speaker was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1166{_}The next two batters were retired, leaving Hall on third.
10028{_}1167{_}There were two out for New York when Meyers made his third single, but he failed to get home.
10028{_}1168{_}With one out in the sixth for Boston Wagner hit safely, but Cady was easily retired.
10028{_}1169{_}Hall was given a base on balls, but Hooper struck out, ending the inning.
10028{_}1170{_}In New York's half, with one out, Devore was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1171{_}Doyle batted the ball over the fence in right field for a home run and Devore scored ahead of him.
10028{_}1172{_}In Boston's half of the seventh, with one out, Speaker singled to center.
10028{_}1173{_}Lewis batted to left field for two bases.
10028{_}1174{_}That put Speaker on third.
10028{_}1175{_}While Fletcher was getting Gardner out of the way, Speaker scored and Lewis reached home on Doyle's fumble of Stahl's grounder.
10028{_}1176{_}In New York's half of this inning Merkle began with a single to center.
10028{_}1177{_}Herzog flied to left field.
10028{_}1178{_}Meyers made his fourth single of the afternoon, but Fletcher flied to right field.
10028{_}1179{_}Tesreau hit to right for a base and Merkle scored.
10028{_}1180{_}In the eighth Doyle muffed Cady's fly.
10028{_}1181{_}Hall singled to right.
10028{_}1182{_}Hooper's sacrifice fly gave Cady a run, Doyle began for New York with a single, but the next three batters were retired in order.
10028{_}1183{_}In the ninth Herzog began with a base on balls.
10028{_}1184{_}Wilson, who was catching, singled to center.
10028{_}1185{_}He was doubled up with Fletcher on a long fly hit.
10028{_}1186{_}Herzog, however, eventually scored his run, which was the seventh of the game for New York.
10028{_}1187{_}In this contest the Giants ran bases with such daring that they had the Boston players confused and uncertain.
10028{_}1188{_}Cady did not know whether to throw the ball or hold it, and the general exhibition of speed on the bases which was made by New York was characteristic of the team's dash in the race for the championship of the National League, and a system which the Boston players could not fathom.
10028{_}1189{_}EIGHTH GAME.
10028{_}1190{_}Boston, Oct. 16, 1912.
10028{_}1191{_}Boston 3; New York 2 (ten innings.)
10028{_}1192{_}Hits--Off Bedient 6, Wood 3; Mathewson 8.
10028{_}1193{_}Struck out--Bedient 2, Wood 2; Mathewson 4.
10028{_}1194{_}Bases on balls--Bedient 3, Wood 1; Mathewson 5.
10028{_}1195{_}Attendance 16,970.
10028{_}1196{_}On the following day, before the smallest crowd of the series, the final game was played in Boston.
10028{_}1197{_}Many Boston fans, disgruntled at the manner in which some of them had been seated, deliberately remained away.
10028{_}1198{_}The air was cold and bleak and in addition to all the rest the enthusiasts of Boston had given up the fight.
10028{_}1199{_}Which merely goes to show the uncertainty of Base Ball.
10028{_}1200{_}The New York players unquestionably had the championship won for nine and one half innings of the final game and then, by the simplest of errors, overturned all of the good which they had accomplished in their wonderful rally of the two days preceding.
10028{_}1201{_}After outplaying the Bostons in a manner which showed some thing of the caliber of the teams when both were going at top speed, the New York team stopped short.
10028{_}1202{_}As one wit dryly put it: "Boston did not win the championship, but New York lost it."
10028{_}1203{_}Mathewson pitched for New York and Bedient for Boston until the end of the seventh inning.
10028{_}1204{_}With two out for the Giants in the first Snodgrass was given a base on balls, but Murray was retired.
10028{_}1205{_}Two were out for Boston when Speaker hit for a single to right field, but Lewis struck out.
10028{_}1206{_}Again in the second two were out for New York when Meyers was safe on Speaker's muff.
10028{_}1207{_}Fletcher singled over second, but Mathewson flied out.
10028{_}1208{_}Hooper began the third with a base hit, but was left.
10028{_}1209{_}Devore started for New York with a base on balls.
10028{_}1210{_}Doyle and Snodgrass were out in succession, Devore advancing, and then Murray doubled to center field and Devore scored.
10028{_}1211{_}In the fourth Herzog started with a two-bagger and if the ground rule had not been changed he would have had an easy triple, and ultimately a run, which would have changed all the outcome of the game.
10028{_}1212{_}As it was, he did not score.
10028{_}1213{_}In the fifth Devore began with a single and was out stealing second after Doyle had flied out and Hooper had made the most wonderful catch of the series, reaching over the right field fence to get the ball with his bare band.
10028{_}1214{_}Snodgrass singled and Murray fouled out.
10028{_}1215{_}In the sixth Meyers received a base on balls with two out but did not score.
10028{_}1216{_}With one out Yerkes singled to right field and Speaker got a base on balls but no run followed.
10028{_}1217{_}In the seventh Mathewson began with a single and was forced out by Devore, who was left on bases while two batters were retired.
10028{_}1218{_}For Boston, with one out, Stahl hit safely to center field.
10028{_}1219{_}It was a pop fly, which fell between three men, Fletcher, Murray and Snodgrass.
10028{_}1220{_}Wagner was given a base on balls and Cady was an easy out.
10028{_}1221{_}Henriksen, batting for Bedient, with two strikes against him, drove the ball on a line toward third base.
10028{_}1222{_}In fact, it hit third base.
10028{_}1223{_}It bounded so far back that Stahl scored the tieing run of the game.
10028{_}1224{_}No runs were scored by either team in the eighth or the ninth innings.
10028{_}1225{_}In the tenth, with one out, Murray lined a double to left field and scored on Merkle's hard single over second.
10028{_}1226{_}That put the Giants in the lead, with Merkle on second.
10028{_}1227{_}Herzog struck out and Wood threw out Meyers.
10028{_}1228{_}The ball had been batted so hard by Meyers to Wood that it crippled the pitcher's hand and compelled him to cease playing.
10028{_}1229{_}It was fortunate for Boston that the hit kept low.
10028{_}1230{_}So much speed had been put into it by the stalwart Indian catcher that had the ball got into the outfield it would have gone to the fence.
10028{_}1231{_}It was the undoing of Wood, but it really led to the victory of Boston.
10028{_}1232{_}Engle batted for Wood in the tenth.
10028{_}1233{_}He rapped a long fly to center field which was perfectly played by Snodgrass, but the center fielder dropped the ball.
10028{_}1234{_}Engle went to second base.
10028{_}1235{_}On top of his simple muff Snodgrass made a magnificent catch of Hooper's fly, which seemed to be good for three bases.
10028{_}1236{_}Mathewson bent every energy to strike out Yerkes, but the batter would not go after the wide curves which were being served to him by the New York pitcher and finally was given a base on balls.
10028{_}1237{_}Speaker hit the first ball pitched for an easy foul which should have been caught by Merkle.
10028{_}1238{_}The ball dropped between Merkle, Meyers and Mathewson.
10028{_}1239{_}As was afterward proved the capture of this foul would have saved the championship for the Giants.
10028{_}1240{_}Speaker, with another life, singled to right and Engle scored the tieing run.
10028{_}1241{_}The Giants still had a chance, but a feeble one, for Yerkes was on third, with but one out.
10028{_}1242{_}Gardner flied to Devore.
10028{_}1243{_}The New York outfielder caught the ball and made a game effort to stop the flying Yerkes at the plate, but failed to do so, and the game was over and the series belonged to Boston.
10028{_}1244{_}Yet so keen had been the struggle, so great the excitement, so wonderful the rally of the New York club after having once given the series away, that it was the opinion generally that the defeated were as great in defeat as the victors were great in victory.

10028{_}1620{_}FOSTER.
10028{_}1621{_}Spurts of energy on the part of different clubs, unexpected ill fortune on the part of others, and marked variations of form, which ranged from the leaders almost to the lowliest teams of the second division, injected spasmodic moments of excited interest into the National League race for 1912 and marked it by more vicissitudes than any of its immediate predecessors.
10028{_}1622{_}By careful analysis it is not a difficult matter to ascertain why the New Yorks won.
10028{_}1623{_}Their speed as a run-getting machine was much superior to that of any of their opponents.
10028{_}1624{_}Every factor of Base Ball which can be studied demonstrates that fact.
10028{_}1625{_}They led the National League in batting and they led it in base running.
10028{_}1626{_}They were keenly alive to the opportunities which were offered to them to win games.
10028{_}1627{_}Indeed, their fall from the high standard which they had set prior to the Fourth of July was quite wholly due to the fact that they failed to take advantage of the situations daily, as they had earlier in the season, and their return to that winning form later in the season, which assured them of the championship, was equally due to the fact that they had regained their ability to make the one run which was necessary to win.
10028{_}1628{_}That, after all, is the vital essential of Base Ball.
10028{_}1629{_}To earn the winning run, not by hook or crook, but to earn it by excelling opponents through superior play in a department where the opponents are weak, is the story of capturing a pennant.
10028{_}1630{_}They were dangerous men to be permitted to get on bases, and their dearest and most bitter enemies on the ball field, with marked candor, confessed that such was the case.
10028{_}1631{_}Opposing leaders admitted that when two or three of the New York players were started toward home plate one or two of them were likely to cross the plate and that, too, when one run might tie the score and two runs might win the game.
10028{_}1632{_}While there were some who were quite sanguine before the beginning of the season that the Giants would win the championship, there were others who were convinced that they would have a hard time to hold their title, and after the season was over both factions were fairly well satisfied with their preliminary forecast.
10028{_}1633{_}The runaway race which New York made up to the Fourth of July gave abundant satisfaction to those who said they would win, and the setback which the team received after the Fourth of July until the latter part of August afforded solace to those who were certain in their own minds that the New Yorks would have much trouble to repeat their victory of 1911.
10028{_}1634{_}It must not be forgotten, too, that the New York team had the benefit of excellent pitching throughout the year.
10028{_}1635{_}In the new record for pitchers, which has been established this season by Secretary Heydler of the National League, and which in part was the outcome of the agitation in the GUIDE for a new method of records, in which the various Base Ball critics of the major league cities so ably contributed their opinions, Tesreau leads all the pitchers in the matter of runs which were earned from his delivery.
10028{_}1636{_}Mathewson is second, Ames is fifth, Marquard seventh and Wiltse and Crandall lower, and while both the latter were hit freely in games in which they were occasionally substituted for others, they pitched admirably in games which they won on their own account.
10028{_}1637{_}In the opinion of the writer this new method, which has been put into usage by Secretary Heydler, is far superior to anything which has been offered in years as a valuable record of the actual work of pitchers.
10028{_}1638{_}It holds the pitcher responsible for every run which is made from his delivery.
10028{_}1639{_}It does not hold him responsible for any runs which may have been made after the opportunity has been offered to retire the side, nor does it hold him responsible for runs which are the result of the fielding errors of his fellow players.
10028{_}1640{_}On the other hand, if he gives bases on balls, if he is batted for base hits, if he makes balks, and if he makes wild pitches, he must stand for his blunders and have all such runs charged against him as earned runs.
10028{_}1641{_}Nothing proves more conclusively the strength of this manner of compiling pitchers' records than that Rucker, by the old system, dropped to twenty-eighth place in the list of National League pitchers, finished third in the earned run computation, showing that if he had been given proper support he probably would have been one of the topmost pitchers of the league, even on the basis of percentage of games won, which is more vainglorious than absolutely truthful.
10028{_}1642{_}The Giants are to be commended for playing clean, sportsmanlike Base Ball.
10028{_}1643{_}There were less than a half dozen instances in which they came into conflict with the umpires.
10028{_}1644{_}The president of the National League complimented Manager McGraw in public upon the excellent conduct of his team upon the field and the players deserved the approbation of the league's chief executive.
10028{_}1645{_}*       *       *       *       *  The general work of the Pittsburgh team throughout the year was good.
10028{_}1646{_}It must have been good to have enabled the players to finish second in the championship contest, but the team, speaking in the broadest sense, seemed to be just good enough not to win the championship.
10028{_}1647{_}As one man dryly but graphically put it: "Pittsburgh makes me think of a wedding cake without the frosting."
10028{_}1648{_}Fred.
10028{_}1649{_}Clarke, manager of the team, adhered resolutely to his determination not to play.
10028{_}1650{_}It was not for the reason that the impulse to play did not seize upon him more than once, but he had formed a conviction, or, at least, he seemed to have formed one, that it would be better for the organization if the younger blood were permitted to make the fight.
10028{_}1651{_}It was the opinion of more than one that Clarke incorrectly estimated his own ball playing ability, in other words, that he was a better ball player than he credited himself with being.
10028{_}1652{_}As batters the Pittsburghs were successful.
10028{_}1653{_}As fielders they were superior to the team that won the championship.
10028{_}1654{_}As run-getters they were not the equal of the Giants.
10028{_}1655{_}In brief, fewer opportunities were accepted to make runs by a much larger percentage than was the case with the New York club, which can easily be verified by a careful study of the scores of the two teams as they opposed one another, and as they played against the other clubs of the league.
10028{_}1656{_}It took more driving power to get the Pittsburgh players around the bases than it did those of New York.
10028{_}1657{_}In tight games, where the advantage of a single run meant victory, the greater speed of the New York players could actually be measured by yards in the difference of results.
10028{_}1658{_}Naturally it was not always easy for the Pittsburgh enthusiasts to see why a team, which assuredly fielded better than the champions and batted almost equally as well, could not gain an advantage over its rivals, but the inability of Pittsburgh Base Ball patrons to comprehend the lack of success on the part of their team existed in the fact that they had but few opportunities, comparatively speaking, to watch the New York players and found it difficult to grasp the true import of that one great factor of speed, which had been so insistently demanded by the New York manager of the men who were under his guidance.
10028{_}1659{_}Pittsburgh had an excellent pitching staff.
10028{_}1660{_}Even better results would have been obtained from it if Adams had been in better physical condition.
10028{_}1661{_}An ailing arm bothered him.
10028{_}1662{_}While he fell below the standard of other years, one splendid young pitcher rapidly developed in Hendrix, and Robinson, a left-hander, with practically no major league experience, pushed his way to a commanding position in the work which he did.
10028{_}1663{_}Until the Giants made their last visit to Pittsburgh in the month of August the western team threatened to come through with a finish, which would give them a chance to swing into first place during the month of September, but the series between New York and Pittsburgh turned the scale against the latter.
10028{_}1664{_}Fired with the knowledge that they were at the turning point in the race the New York players battled desperately with their rivals on Pittsburgh's home field and won.
10028{_}1665{_}Even the Pittsburgh players were filled with admiration for the foe whom they had met, and while they were not in the mood to accept defeat with equanimity, they did accept it graciously and congratulated the victors as they left Pittsburgh after playing the last game of the season which had been scheduled between them on Forbes Field.
10028{_}1666{_}First base had long bothered Clarke.
10028{_}1667{_}Frequent experiments had been made to obtain a first baseman, who could play with accuracy on the field and bat to the standard of the team generally.
10028{_}1668{_}Clarke transferred Miller from second base to first and the change worked well.
10028{_}1669{_}More graceful and more accurate first basemen have been developed than Miller, but in his first year of play at the bag he steadied the team perceptibly and unquestionably gave confidence to the other men.
10028{_}1670{_}But making a first baseman out of Miller took away a second baseman and second base gave Clarke more or less concern all of the season.
10028{_}1671{_}At that, Pittsburgh was not so poorly off in second base play as some other of the teams of the senior circuit.
10028{_}1672{_}*       *       *       *       *  Two important factors contributed to the success of the Chicagos in 1912.
10028{_}1673{_}For a few days they threatened to assume the leadership of the National League.
10028{_}1674{_}With the opportunity almost within their grasp the machine, which had been patched for the moment, fell to pieces, and the Cubs, brought to a climax in their work by all the personal magnetism and the driving power of which Chance was capable, were exhausted by their strongest effort.
10028{_}1675{_}The courage and the wish were there, but the team lacked the playing strength.
10028{_}1676{_}To return to the factors which contributed to the club's success.
10028{_}1677{_}They were the restoration to health of Evers, and a complete change in the manner of playing second base, added to the consistent and powerful batting of Zimmerman.
10028{_}1678{_}The latter led the league in batting and repeatedly pulled his club through close contests by the forceful manner in which he met the ball with men on bases.
10028{_}1679{_}A third contributing force, though less continuous, was the brief spurt which was made by the Chicago pitchers in the middle of the season.
10028{_}1680{_}They were strongest at the moment that the New York team was playing its poorest game, and their temporary success assisted in pushing the Chicagos somewhat rapidly toward the top of the league.
10028{_}1681{_}They were not resourceful enough nor strong enough to maintain their average of victories and finished the season somewhat as they had begun.
10028{_}1682{_}The most of Chicago's success began to date from the early part of July, when Lavender, pitching for the Cubs, won from Marquard of the Giants, who, to that time, had nineteen successive victories to his credit.
10028{_}1683{_}Chicago continued to win, and the New York team made a very poor trip through the west.
10028{_}1684{_}Lavender's physical strength held up well for a month and then it became quite evident that he had pitched himself out.
10028{_}1685{_}Then was the time that the Chicagos could have used to good advantage two and certainly one steady and reliable pitcher, who had been through the fire of winning pennants and would not be disturbed by the importance which attached to games in which his club was for the moment the runner-up in the championship race.
10028{_}1686{_}Chicago managed to hold its own fairly well against the New York team.
10028{_}1687{_}Indeed, the Cubs beat the New Yorks on the series for the season, but there were other clubs, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Cincinnati, which won from Chicago when victories were most needed by the Cubs, and their hope to capture the pennant deserted them as they were making their last trip through the east.
10028{_}1688{_}The race was not without its bright side for Chicago.
10028{_}1689{_}Even if the Cubs did finish third for the first time since Chance had been manager of the organization, it was a welcome sight to see Evers apparently in as good form as ever and Zimmerman so strong with the bat that the leadership of the batters finally returned to Chicago after it had been absent for years.
10028{_}1690{_}*       *       *       *       *  Cincinnati, under the management of Henry O'Day, finished fourth in the race.
10028{_}1691{_}It was by no means a weak showing for the new manager, in view of the team which he was compelled to handle.
10028{_}1692{_}Until the New York club played its first series in Cincinnati, which began May 18, the Reds were booming along at the top of the league, apparently with no intention that they might ever drop back.
10028{_}1693{_}It was New York that won three out of the five games played and took the lead in the race, and when that happened Cincinnati never was in front again.
10028{_}1694{_}To the other managers, who had been watching the work of the Cincinnatis it was apparent that sooner or later the break would have to come for the reason that, as the season progressed, better pitching would have to be faced by the Cincinnati club, while it was doubtful whether the Cincinnati pitchers could do any better than they were doing.
10028{_}1695{_}The manager seemed to have known this, for when the break did come and the Reds began to totter, he said in reference to their downfall that no team could be expected to win with only ordinary pitching to assist it.
10028{_}1696{_}In this manner Cincinnati played through the middle of the season always just a little behind most of its opponents.
10028{_}1697{_}As the latter days of the year began to dawn the Reds began to improve and not the least of which was in the better work of the pitchers.
10028{_}1698{_}They did well enough to beat Philadelphia for fourth place, and while O'Day did not have the satisfaction of finding his first year as a manager generous enough to him to make him the runner-up for the championship team, he actually put his club in the first division, which is something in which many managers have failed and some of them managers of long experience.
10028{_}1699{_}*       *       *       *       *  Misfortune and ill luck always attaches itself in a minor degree to every team which engages in a championship contest, but most assuredly Philadelphia had more of its share of reverses through accidents to players and illness than any team of the National League.
10028{_}1700{_}Yet the Philadelphias were courageous players from whom little complaint was heard.
10028{_}1701{_}They took their misfortunes with what grace they could and played ball with what success they could achieve, whether they had their best team in the field or their poorest.
10028{_}1702{_}Strangely enough they played an important part in the results of the race.
10028{_}1703{_}Frequently they defeated the Chicagos, all too frequently for the comfort of the Chicago Base Ball enthusiasts, and when the loss of a game or two by the Philadelphias to the Chicagos might have turned the race temporarily one way or the other, the Philadelphias, with decided conviction, refused to lose.
10028{_}1704{_}It may not be necessary to call attention to the fact of absolute fairness in the contests for championships in the various leagues which comprise Base Ball in its organized form.
10028{_}1705{_}The day has passed when the Base Ball enthusiast permits his mind to dwell much upon that sort of thing, if ever he did.
10028{_}1706{_}But if it were necessary to advance an argument as to the integrity of the sport and the high class of the men who are engaged in the summer season in playing professional Base Ball, there could be nothing better to prove that the price of victory is the one great consideration, greater than the fact of Philadelphia's success against a team which was a strong contender against that which finally won the championship.
10028{_}1707{_}As much as Philadelphia desired that New York should be beaten, for there was no love lost between the teams in a ball playing way, the fighting spirit and the predominant desire to add to the column of victories as many games as possible brought forth the best efforts of the team of ill fortune against Chicago and struck telling blows against Chicago's success at the most timely moments.
10028{_}1708{_}*       *       *       *       *  As a whole the St. Louis team did not play as well in 1912 as it did in the preceding year.
10028{_}1709{_}There was some bad luck for St. Louis as well as Philadelphia.
10028{_}1710{_}The players did not get started as well as they had in the previous two years.
10028{_}1711{_}Their spring training was more or less disastrous, for they were one of the clubs to run into the most contrary of spring weather.
10028{_}1712{_}Perhaps the worst trouble which the St. Louis team had, take the season through from beginning to finish, was in regard to the pitchers.
10028{_}1713{_}There were two or three young men on the team who seemed at the close of the season of 1911 to be likely to develop into high class pitchers in 1912.
10028{_}1714{_}They pitched well in 1912 at intervals.
10028{_}1715{_}One day it seemed as if they at last had struck their stride and the next they faltered and their unsteadiness gave their opponents the advantage which they sought.
10028{_}1716{_}Perhaps, if the St. Louis team had been a little stronger to batting it would have rated higher among the organization of the National League.
10028{_}1717{_}Several games were lost which would have been taken into camp by a better display at bat.
10028{_}1718{_}In fielding the team was much stronger and the success of the infield, combined with some excellent outfield work now and then, frequently held the team up in close battles, but when the pitchers faltered on the path the fielders were not able to bear the force of the attack.
10028{_}1719{_}*       *       *       *       *  For three seasons in succession Brooklyn seems to have been fated to start the season with bad luck and misfortune.
10028{_}1720{_}The spring training trip did not bring to Brooklyn all that had been expected owing to the inclement weather.
10028{_}1721{_}When the team began the season at Washington Park a tremendous crowd filled the stands.
10028{_}1722{_}Long before it was time for the game to begin the spectators became unruly and swarmed over the field.
10028{_}1723{_}It was impossible for the ground police to do anything with the excited enthusiasts and at last the city police were asked to assist.
10028{_}1724{_}They tried to clear the field, but only succeeded in driving the crowd from the infield.
10028{_}1725{_}Spectators were so thick in the outfield that they crowded upon the bases and prevented the players from doing their best.
10028{_}1726{_}For that matter the outfielders could not do much of anything.
10028{_}1727{_}A ground rule of two bases into the crowd was established, and the New York players, who were the opponents of Brooklyn, took advantage of it to drive the ball with all their force, trusting that it would sail over the heads of the fielders and drop into the crowd.
10028{_}1728{_}They were so successful that they made a record for two-base hits and Brooklyn was overwhelmed.
10028{_}1729{_}This unfortunate beginning appeared to depress the Brooklyn team.
10028{_}1730{_}The players recovered slightly, but had barely got into their stride again when accidents to the men began to happen.
10028{_}1731{_}Some of them became ill, and the manager was put to his wits end to get a team on the field which should make a good showing.
10028{_}1732{_}Fighting against these odds Brooklyn made the best record that it could.
10028{_}1733{_}As the season warmed into the hotter months the infield had to be rearranged.
10028{_}1734{_}There was disappointment in the playing of some of the infielders.
10028{_}1735{_}It was also necessary to reconstruct the outfield.
10028{_}1736{_}Unable to get all of the men whom he would have desired the manager continued to experiment and his experiments brought forth good fruit, for unquestionably the excellent work of Moran, who played both right field and center field for Brooklyn, was a great help to the pitchers.
10028{_}1737{_}By the time that the Base Ball playing year was almost concluded Brooklyn had so far recovered that it was able to place a better nine on the diamond than had been the case all of the year.
10028{_}1738{_}Boston never was expected to be a championship organization.
10028{_}1739{_}The material was not there for a championship organization, but Boston did play better ball than in 1911 and that is to the credit of players, manager and owner.
10028{_}1740{_}The club had changed hands, but the new owner had not been able to readjust all of the positions to suit him.
10028{_}1741{_}He put the best nine possible in the field with what he had.
10028{_}1742{_}Never threatening to become a championship winning team Boston played steadily with what strength it possessed and always a little better than in 1911, so that the year could not fairly be considered unsuccessful at its finish.
10028{_}1743{_}*       *       *       *       *  Going back to the beginning of the year and looking over the contest for the National League championship of 1912, it is not uninteresting, indeed it is of much interest to call attention to the remarkably odd record which was made by New York to win the pennant.
10028{_}1744{_}In that record stands the story of the fight, with striking shifts from week to week.
10028{_}1745{_}The first game played by the Giants was against Brooklyn, as has been related, and it was won by New York and that, by the way, was the game in which Marquard began his admirable record as a pitcher for the season.
10028{_}1746{_}The Giants lost the next three games.
10028{_}1747{_}Two of them were to Brooklyn and one to Boston, and the players of the New York team began to wonder a little as to what had happened to them.
10028{_}1748{_}Then New York won nine straight games from the eastern clubs, being stopped finally by Philadelphia on the Polo Grounds.
10028{_}1749{_}But that defeat did not check them.
10028{_}1750{_}They started on another winning spurt and played throughout the west without a defeat until they arrived in Cincinnati.
10028{_}1751{_}This total of victories was nine.
10028{_}1752{_}All of the games on the schedule were not played because of inclement weather.
10028{_}1753{_}Cincinnati won twice from New York and then the Giants turned the tables on the Reds, who had been leading the league.
10028{_}1754{_}They threw them out of the lead, which they never regained, and won another succession of nine victories.
10028{_}1755{_}That made three times consecutively that they had won a total of twenty-seven games in groups of nine, assuredly an unusual result.
10028{_}1756{_}Losing one game they again entered the winning class.
10028{_}1757{_}This time they won six games in succession.
10028{_}1758{_}Then they lost a game.
10028{_}1759{_}After this single defeat they won but three games.
10028{_}1760{_}Their charm of games in blocks of nine had deserted them.
10028{_}1761{_}They were beaten twice after winning three, and Pittsburgh was the team.
10028{_}1762{_}Then they won another single game and immediately after that victory lost to Brooklyn.
10028{_}1763{_}But that was the last defeat for a long time.
10028{_}1764{_}Well into the race, with their condition excellent, and playing better ball than they had played since their wonderful spurt of the month of September in 1911, they won sixteen games in succession.
10028{_}1765{_}The morning of the Fourth of July dawned hot and sultry.
10028{_}1766{_}The air was thick and muggy and without life.
10028{_}1767{_}The Giants were scheduled to play two games that day with Brooklyn, the first in the morning and the second in the afternoon.
10028{_}1768{_}If they won both of them they would tie a former record, which had been made by the New York team, for consecutive victories.
10028{_}1769{_}Perhaps it may have been reaction after the long strain of winning or it may have been an uncommonly good streak of batting on the part of Brooklyn.
10028{_}1770{_}Surely Brooklyn batted well enough, as the morning game went to the latter team by the score of 10 to 4.
10028{_}1771{_}In the afternoon Brooklyn again beat the Giants by the score of 5 to 2.
10028{_}1772{_}Wiltse pitched for New York and Stack for Brooklyn.
10028{_}1773{_}The New York team went to Chicago and won twice.
10028{_}1774{_}Then it lost.
10028{_}1775{_}The fourth game was won from Chicago and then the Giants lost two in succession.
10028{_}1776{_}They won one game and immediately after that lost four in succession.
10028{_}1777{_}Chicago began to have visions of winning the pennant.
10028{_}1778{_}From Chicago the Giants went to Pittsburgh, stood firm in a series of three games, winning two and losing one.
10028{_}1779{_}Their next call was at Cincinnati and beginning with that series they got back to form a trifle and won five games in succession.
10028{_}1780{_}Returning home they were beaten on the Polo Grounds three games in succession by Chicago.
10028{_}1781{_}After that New York settled into a winning stride again and won six games in succession.
10028{_}1782{_}Pittsburgh came to the Polo Grounds and stopped the winning streak of the champions by defeating them three times in succession.
10028{_}1783{_}That was a hard jolt for any team to stand.
10028{_}1784{_}Yet the Giants rallied and won the test game of the Pittsburgh series.
10028{_}1785{_}It was but a momentary pause, for after another victory St. Louis beat New York.
10028{_}1786{_}The Giants won another game and the next day lost to St. Louis.
10028{_}1787{_}That finished the home games for New York and the team started west, facing a desperate fight.
10028{_}1788{_}They lost the first game to Chicago, won the next and lost the third.
10028{_}1789{_}Going from Chicago to St. Louis they won three games in succession, returning to Chicago, lost a postponed game with the Cubs.
10028{_}1790{_}From Chicago their path led them to Pittsburgh where they lost the first contest.
10028{_}1791{_}Then they made the stand of the season when they beat the Pittsburghs four games in succession.
10028{_}1792{_}Cincinnati turned the tables on the Giants to the consternation of the New York fans and won twice, when it seemed as if the Giants were about to start on a career which would safely land the championship.
10028{_}1793{_}The Giants returned home and beat Brooklyn in the first game and lost the second.
10028{_}1794{_}They won the next two and then lost again.
10028{_}1795{_}The championship was still in abeyance.
10028{_}1796{_}Again they won and then lost to Philadelphia.
10028{_}1797{_}Here came another test in a Philadelphia series at Philadelphia which contained postponed games, and once more rallying with all their might, won four games and lost the last of this series of five.
10028{_}1798{_}Following that they won three games and then lost to St. Louis.
10028{_}1799{_}They won three times in succession and then lost four games to Chicago and Cincinnati, but all of this time Chicago was gradually falling away because it was necessary that the Cubs should continue to win successive victories if they were to beat New York for the championship.
10028{_}1800{_}The Giants atoned for the four defeats at the hands of Chicago and Cincinnati by winning the next four games in succession, and while this did not actually settle the championship, that is, the definite championship game had not been played, the race was practically over and all that was left to fight for in the National League was second place, in which Chicago and Pittsburgh were most interested.
10028{_}1801{_}The pitching staff of the Chicagos had worn out under the strain and the Cubs were beaten out by Pittsburgh.

10028{_}1911{_}AMERICAN LEAGUE SEASON OF 1912  BY IRVING E. SANBORN, CHICAGO.
10028{_}1912{_}Pre-season predictions in Base Ball do not carry much weight individually, but when many minds, looking at the game from different angles, agree on the main points there usually is good reason behind such near unanimity.
10028{_}1913{_}Outside of Boston it is doubtful if any experienced critic of Base Ball in the country expected the Red Sox to be converted from a second division team into pennant winners in one short season.
10028{_}1914{_}If such expectancy existed in Boston it was partially a case of the wish fathering the thought.
10028{_}1915{_}The majority of men believed the machine with which Connie Mack had achieved two league and two world's championships was good for at least one more American League pennant.
10028{_}1916{_}That expectation was based on the comparative youth of the important cogs in the Athletic machine.
10028{_}1917{_}Yet this dope went all wrong.
10028{_}1918{_}The Athletics were beaten out by two teams which were in the second division in 1911, one of them as low as seventh place.
10028{_}1919{_}The reason for these form reversals were several.
10028{_}1920{_}The Boston and Washington teams improved magically in new hands, while the Athletics went back a bit, partly because of too much prosperity and partly because of adversity.
10028{_}1921{_}Having come from behind in 1911 and made a winning from a wretched start, the Mackmen apparently thought they could do it again and delayed starting their fight until it was too late.
10028{_}1922{_}The loss of the services of Dan Murphy for more than half of the season also was a prime factor.
10028{_}1923{_}The White Sox were the season's sensations both ways and for a time kept everybody guessing by their whirlwind start under new management.
10028{_}1924{_}They walked over every opponent they tackled for the first few weeks, then began to slip and it required herculean efforts to keep them in the first division at the finish.
10028{_}1925{_}The Chicago team always was a puzzle to all parties to the race, including itself.
10028{_}1926{_}From the outset there was almost no hope for the other four teams in the league.
10028{_}1927{_}Cleveland and Detroit occasionally broke into the upper circles for a day or two in the early weeks of the season, but not far enough to rouse any false anticipations among their supporters.
10028{_}1928{_}St. Louis and New York quickly gravitated to the lower strata and remained there, the Yankees finally losing out in their battle with the Browns to keep out of last place.
10028{_}1929{_}Five American League teams started the season under new managers.
10028{_}1930{_}One of the three which began the race under leaders retained from the previous year changed horses in mid-stream.
10028{_}1931{_}Jake Stahl, Harry Wolverton, Clark Griffith, Harry Davis and James Callahan were the new faces in the managerial gallery.
10028{_}1932{_}Some of them were not exactly new to the job but were in new jobs.
10028{_}1933{_}Of these Stahl, Griffith and Callahan proved successful leaders and the first named became the hero of a world's championship team when the last ball of the series was caught.
10028{_}1934{_}Davis resigned during the season and was succeeded by Joe Birmingham, who almost duplicated the feat of George Stovall in 1911, putting new life into the Cleveland team and starting a spurt which made the race for position interesting.
10028{_}1935{_}Wolverton stuck the season out in spite of handicaps that would have discouraged anybody, then handed in his resignation.
10028{_}1936{_}Wallace, who started the year at the helm again in St. Louis, cheerfully handed over the management to Stovall, who had been transplanted into the Mound City in the hope of making Davis' task easier in Cleveland.
10028{_}1937{_}Stovall made the Browns a hard team to beat and had the mild satisfaction of hoisting them out of the cellar which they had occupied for the better part of three seasons.
10028{_}1938{_}An unpleasant feature of the season, but one which had beneficial results, was the strike of the Detroit players, entailing the staging of a farcical game in Philadelphia between the Athletics and a team of semi-professionals.
10028{_}1939{_}This incident grew out of an attack on a New York spectator by Ty Cobb while in uniform and the immediate suspension of the player for an indefinite period.
10028{_}1940{_}The prompt and unyielding stand taken by President Johnson against the action of the Detroit players and the diplomatic efforts of President Navin of that club averted serious or extended trouble and undoubtedly furnished a warning against any similar act in the near future.
10028{_}1941{_}Another, excellent result was the effort made by club owners to prevent the abuse of the right of free speech by that small element of the game's patronage which finds its greatest joy in abusing the players, secure in the knowledge that it is practically protected from personal injury in retaliation.
10028{_}1942{_}In the development of new players of note the league enjoyed an average season, and a considerable amount of new blood was injected into the game in the persons of players who made good without attracting freakish attention.
10028{_}1943{_}The rise of the Washington team from seventh to second place brought its youngsters into the limelight prominently, and of these Foster and Moeller were commended highly.
10028{_}1944{_}Gandil, who had his second tryout in fast company, plugged the hole at first base which had worried Washington managers for some time.
10028{_}1945{_}Shanks also made a reputation for himself as a fielder.
10028{_}1946{_}These men were helped somewhat by the showing of their team, but the case of Gandil would have been notable In any company.
10028{_}1947{_}His first advent into the majors with the White Sox showed him to be an exceedingly promising player, but for some reason his work fell off until he was discarded into the International League.
10028{_}1948{_}There he quickly recovered his stride and, when he did come back shortly after the season opened last spring, he demonstrated that he had the ability to hit consistently and proved a tower of strength to Griffith's team.
10028{_}1949{_}Baumgardner of the St. Louis Browns was an example of a youngster making good in spite of comparatively poor company.
10028{_}1950{_}His pitching record with a team which finished in seventh place stamps him as one of the best, if not the best, of the slab finds of the year.
10028{_}1951{_}Jean Dubuc of Detroit was another find of rare value and still another was Buck O'Brien of Boston, but these had the advantage over Baumgardner of getting better support both in the field and at bat.
10028{_}1952{_}O'Brien in particular was fortunate to break in with a championship team.
10028{_}1953{_}The White Sox introduced three youngsters who made good and promise to keep on doing so.
10028{_}1954{_}Two of them, George Weaver and Morris Rath, started the season with Chicago and the third, Baker Borton, joined the team late in the summer.
10028{_}1955{_}Still later Kay Schalk started in to make what looks like a name for himself as a catcher.
10028{_}1956{_}*       *       *       *       *  No better illustration of the slight difference between a pennant winning machine and a losing team in the American League has occurred recently than the Boston Red Sox furnished last year.
10028{_}1957{_}It did not differ materially from the team of 1910 which compelled the use of the nickname "Speed Boys."
10028{_}1958{_}Jake Stahl was a member of that team, and except for the absence of Stahl in 1911, the champions of 1912 were composed of practically the same men who finished in the second division only the year before.
10028{_}1959{_}But for the showing of 1910 the whole credit for last season's transformation might be attributed to Manager Stahl.
10028{_}1960{_}Much of it unquestionably is his by right, and there is no intent here to deprive him of any of the high honors he achieved.
10028{_}1961{_}To Stahl's arrangement of his infield probably is due much of the improvement in the team.
10028{_}1962{_}The outfield trio of wonderful performers did not perform any more wonders last year than in the previous season, but what had been holes on the infield were plugged tightly.
10028{_}1963{_}Many looked askance when Larry Gardner, supposedly a second baseman, was assigned to third, but the results more than justified the move, and it made room at second for Yerkes, a player who had proved only mediocre on the other side of the diamond.
10028{_}1964{_}This switch and the return of Stahl, who is a grand mark to throw at on first base, gave the infield the same dash and confidence as the outfield possessed, and the addition of some pitching strength in Bedient and O'Brien did the rest.
10028{_}1965{_}It is the ability to discover just the right combination that differentiates the real manager from the semi-failure.
10028{_}1966{_}The Red Sox were in the race from the start, but they were eclipsed for a time by the White Sox.
10028{_}1967{_}In spite of that the Bostonians never faltered but kept up a mighty consistent gait all the way and wore down all competitors before the finish.
10028{_}1968{_}Stahl's men never were lower than second place in the race with the exception of three days early in May.
10028{_}1969{_}when Washington poked its nose in front of the Red Sox and started after the White Sox, only to be driven back into third place by the men of Callahan themselves.
10028{_}1970{_}For more than a week in April Boston was in the lead.
10028{_}1971{_}Then Chicago went out and established a lead so long that it lasted until near the middle of June.
10028{_}1972{_}Boston attended strictly to its knitting, however.
10028{_}1973{_}Without stopping in their steady stride, the Red Sox hung on, waiting for the Callahans to slump.
10028{_}1974{_}When their chance came in June the Bostonians jumped into the lead--June 10 was the exact date--and never thereafter did they take any team's dust.
10028{_}1975{_}By the Fourth of July Boston had a lead of seven games over the Athletics.
10028{_}1976{_}The Red Sox kept right along at their even gait and a month later were leading by the same margin over Washington, which had displaced the former champions.
10028{_}1977{_}On September 1 Boston's lead was thirteen games, but it was not until September 18 that the American League pennant was actually cinched beyond the possibility of losing it.
10028{_}1978{_}All season Stahl's men were known as a lucky ball team.
10028{_}1979{_}Delving into the files for the dope, revealed the fact that the newspaper reports of about every third game they played on the average contained some reference to "Boston's luck."
10028{_}1980{_}This does not detract anything from their glory.
10028{_}1981{_}No team ever won a major league pennant unless it was lucky.
10028{_}1982{_}No team ever had as steady a run of luck as Boston enjoyed in 1912, unless that team made a lot of its own luck by persistently hammering away when luck was against it and keeping ever on the alert to take advantage of an opening.
10028{_}1983{_}That is the explanation of the unusual consistency that marked the work of the Red Sox all season and the fact they did not experience a serious slump.
10028{_}1984{_}In the first month of the season they won twelve games and lost eight.
10028{_}1985{_}The second month of the race was their poorest one--the nearest they came to a slump.
10028{_}1986{_}In that month they won eight and lost ten games.
10028{_}1987{_}In the third month Boston won twenty-three and lost seven games.
10028{_}1988{_}The fourth month saw them win twenty games and lose eight and in the fifth month their record was twenty victories and five defeats.
10028{_}1989{_}In the final stages of the race the Red Sox were not under as strong pressure from behind and naturally did not travel as fast after sighting the wire, but the figures produced explain why Boston won the pennant.
10028{_}1990{_}It started well and kept going faster until there was no longer need for speed.
10028{_}1991{_}The annexation of the world's championship in a record breaking world's series with the New York Giants was a fitting climax to their season's achievement.
10028{_}1992{_}*       *       *       *       *  When Clark Griffith stalked through the west on his first invasion of the season with a team of youngsters, some of them practically unknown, and declared he was going after the pennant, everybody laughed or wanted to.
10028{_}1993{_}A few weeks later everybody who had laughed was sorry, and those who only wanted to laugh were glad they didn't.
10028{_}1994{_}For Griffith kept his men keyed up to the fighting pitch during the greater part of the season, and when they did start slumping in September, he made a slight switch on his infield, applied the brakes and started them going up again.
10028{_}1995{_}The result was that Washington finished second for the first time in its major league history, winning that position in the closing days of the race after a bitter tussle with the passing world's champions.
10028{_}1996{_}The acquisition of Gandil from Montreal plugged a hole at first base which had defied the efforts of several predecessors to stop and it helped make a brilliant infield, for it gave the youngsters something they were not afraid to throw at.
10028{_}1997{_}In giving credit for the work of Griffith's infield, the inclination is to overestimate the worth of the new stars.
10028{_}1998{_}But there was a tower of strength at short in George McBride, who has been playing steadily and consistently at that position for several seasons without being given one-tenth the credit his work has merited.
10028{_}1999{_}The Washington team at one time or another occupied every position in the race except the first and last.
10028{_}2000{_}The Senators were in seventh place for a few days in the opening weeks of the season, but not anywhere nearly as long as they were in second place later on.
10028{_}2001{_}They climbed out of the second division by rapid stages and after May 1 they were driven back into it only once during the rest of the year.
10028{_}2002{_}That was for three days in the beginning of June.
10028{_}2003{_}In the meantime they had knocked Boston out of second place for a short while in May and, most of the way, had enjoyed a close fight with Philadelphia for third and fourth spots.
10028{_}2004{_}Near the middle of June, after the Red Sox had ousted their White namesakes from first place, the Senators also passed Chicago and started after Boston.
10028{_}2005{_}But the youngsters were not yet hardened to the strain and soon fell back to third and fourth.
10028{_}2006{_}On July 5 Washington went into second place and held onto it, with the exception of three days, for a period of two months.
10028{_}2007{_}September brought a slump and Griffith's men surrendered the runner-up position to the Athletics for about two weeks, then came back and took it away from the Mackmen at the end.
10028{_}2008{_}*       *       *       *       *  What happened to the world's champion Athletics the public did not really know until after the middle of the season.
10028{_}2009{_}Then the suspensions of Chief Bender and Rube Oldring blazoned the fact that Manager Mack's splendid system of handling a Base Ball team by moral suasion had fallen down in the face of overconfidence and too much prosperity.
10028{_}2010{_}Few people saw any reason for changing their belief in the prowess of the Athletics during the first half of the season, because they were in as good position most of the time as they had been the year previous at the same stage of the race.
10028{_}2011{_}They were expected to make the same strong finish that swept everything before it in 1911.
10028{_}2012{_}Not until the second half of the season was well under way did the adherents of the Mackmen give up the battle.
10028{_}2013{_}Philadelphia's sterling young infield seemed to stand up all right all the year, but the outfield and the slab staff gave Connie Mack sleepless nights.
10028{_}2014{_}When Dan Murphy was injured in Chicago in June it was discovered what he had meant to the team.
10028{_}2015{_}Dan was what the final punch is to a boxing star.
10028{_}2016{_}His timely batting was missed in knocking out opponents, and the injury kept him out all the rest of the season.
10028{_}2017{_}The strain which Jack Coombs gave his side in the world's series of 1911 proved more serious and lasting than was expected, and if Eddie Plank had not come back into grand form it would have been a tougher season than it was for the Athletics.
10028{_}2018{_}The Mackmen made a bad beginning for champions, and on May 1 were in the second division.
10028{_}2019{_}During all of May and part of June they climbed into the first division and fell out of it with great regularity.
10028{_}2020{_}Not until near the middle of June did the Athletics gain a strangle hold on the upper half of the league standing, from that time on they kept above the .500 mark, and toward the end of June they met the White Sox coming back.
10028{_}2021{_}There was a short scuffle during the early part of July among the Athletics, Senators and White Sox for the possession of the position next to Boston.
10028{_}2022{_}Then Chicago was pushed back, leaving Philadelphia and Washington to fight it out the rest of the way.
10028{_}2023{_}Trimming the Phillies four out of five games in their city series did not lessen the gloom of the Athletics.
10028{_}2024{_}*       *       *       *       *  The White Sox by their meteoric career demonstrated the value of good condition at the start.
10028{_}2025{_}Although the Chicagoans experienced tough weather in Texas last spring they fared better than any of the other teams in their league, and that fact, combined with the readiness with which youth gets into playing trim, enabled the White Sox to walk through the early weeks of their schedule with an ease that astonished everybody.
10028{_}2026{_}Even prophets who were friendly to them had expected no such showing.
10028{_}2027{_}So fast did the Callahans travel that on May 3 they had lost only four games, having won thirteen in that time.
10028{_}2028{_}But Boston was hanging on persistently.
10028{_}2029{_}Chicago's margin over the Red Sox varied from four to five and a half games; during May, on the fourteenth of that month the White Sox had won twenty-one games and lost only five, giving them the percentage of .808.
10028{_}2030{_}During part of this time they were on their first invasion of the east.
10028{_}2031{_}May 18 saw the Chicago men five and a half games in the lead and their constituents were dreaming of another world's pennant almost every night.
10028{_}2032{_}Even the doubters were beginning to believe Manager Callahan had found the right combination.
10028{_}2033{_}Just then came the awakening.
10028{_}2034{_}The luck which had been coming their way began breaking against them with remarkable persistency.
10028{_}2035{_}Plays that had won game after game went wrong and youth was not resourceful enough to offset the breaks.
10028{_}2036{_}The White Sox began to fall away fast in percentage, but managed to cling to the lead until June 10.
10028{_}2037{_}Boston passed them right there and the Chicagoans kept on going.
10028{_}2038{_}By mid-season Manager Callahan was fighting to keep his men in the first division and their slump did not end until they landed in fifth place for a couple of days in August.
10028{_}2039{_}Then in desperation Callahan began switching his line-up and by herculean effort--and the help of Ed Walsh--climbed back into the upper quartet and stuck there to the finish.
10028{_}2040{_}It was a desperate remedy to take Harry Lord off third base, where he had played during most of his professional career, and try to convert him into an outfielder, a position in which he had had no experience at all.
10028{_}2041{_}But Lord was too good an offensive player to take out of the game, in spite of his slump at third base, and he was willing to try the outfield.
10028{_}2042{_}Results justified the move.
10028{_}2043{_}Lord learned outfielding rapidly, and Zeider proved that third base was his natural position.
10028{_}2044{_}The acquisition of Borton for first base enabled Callahan to put Collins in the outfield, and the White Sox in reality were a stronger team when they finished than when they started their runaway race in April.
10028{_}2045{_}With one more reliable pitcher to take his turn regularly on the slab all season the White Sox would have kept in the race.
10028{_}2046{_}Callahan's men made up for some of the disappointment they produced by beating the Cubs in a nine-game post-season series, after the Cubs had won three victories.
10028{_}2047{_}Two of the nine games were drawn and one other went into extra innings, making a more extended combat than the world's series.
10028{_}2048{_}*       *       *       *       *  Cleveland's 1912 experience was almost identical with that of 1911, even to swapping managers in mid-season.
10028{_}2049{_}Harry Davis, for years first lieutenant to Connie Mack, took the management or the Naps under a severe handicap.
10028{_}2050{_}He succeeded a temporary manager, George Stovall, who had made good in the latter half of the previous season, but who could not be retained without abrogating a previous agreement with Davis.
10028{_}2051{_}The public did not take kindly to the situation when the Naps failed to get into the fight, and the new management had a pitching staff of youngsters with out much of a catching staff to help them out when in trouble.
10028{_}2052{_}The Cleveland team never was prominent in the race after the first fortnight, although it retained a respectable position at the top of the second division, with an occasional journey into the first division during the first month or six weeks.
10028{_}2053{_}In the middle of June the Naps dropped back into sixth place, below Detroit, for a while, then took a brace and reclaimed the leadership of the second squad for part of July.
10028{_}2054{_}Midway in August found Cleveland apparently anchored in sixth spot and, with the consent of the Cleveland club owners, Manager Davis resigned his position.
10028{_}2055{_}The management was given to Joe Birmingham, who took hold of it with enthusiasm but without experience, just as Stovall did the previous year.
10028{_}2056{_}He infused new life into the team, shook it up a bit, and improved its playing so much that Cleveland passed Detroit before the end of the race, and was threatening to knock Chicago out of fourth place at one time.
10028{_}2057{_}This would have happened but for the brace of the White Sox.
10028{_}2058{_}Profiting by previous experience the club owners did not look around for a permanent manager until they saw what Birmingham could do, and in consequence were in position to offer him the leadership of the Naps for the season of 1913.
10028{_}2059{_}*       *       *       *       *  What was left to Manager Jennings from the great Detroit team that had won three straight pennants was slowing up, with the exception of Tyrus Cobb, who has yet to reach the meridian of his career, and the Georgian got into trouble fairly early in the season, with the result that he was suspended for a considerable period.
10028{_}2060{_}That and the strike of the Tigers in Philadelphia threw a monkey-wrench into the machinery, resulting in a tangle which Jennings was unable to straighten out all the season.
10028{_}2061{_}There was a problem at first base which he had a hard time solving.
10028{_}2062{_}The break in Del Gainor's wrist the season before had not mended as it should have done, and he was unable to play the position regularly.
10028{_}2063{_}Moriarty was pressed into service there and did good work in an unfamiliar position; then the infield was shifted several times without marked benefit.
10028{_}2064{_}Donovan, who had always been of great help on the slab in hot weather, was not equal to the task of another year and was made manager of the Providence team.
10028{_}2065{_}Jean Dubuc was the only one of the young pitchers who proved a star, but his work kept the Tigers from being a lot more disappointing proposition than they were.
10028{_}2066{_}*       *       *       *       *  St. Louis and New York were outclassed from the start.
10028{_}2067{_}Two weeks after the season opened it was apparent they were doomed to fight it out for the last round on the ladder.
10028{_}2068{_}That the Browns finally escaped the cellar in the closing days of the race was due largely to the efforts of Stovall, who was made manager to succeed Wallace near the middle of the season.
10028{_}2069{_}As early as the first of May it was seen the Browns and Yankees were destined to trail.
10028{_}2070{_}The New York team quickly gravitated to the bottom.
10028{_}2071{_}It started without the services of Catcher Eddie Sweeney, who held out for a larger salary, and it had a manager at the helm who was inexperienced in major league leadership.
10028{_}2072{_}Not until April 24 did New York win a game and in that time it had lost seven straight, postponements accounting for the rest of the time.
10028{_}2073{_}St. Louis got a little better start and for a while was inclined to dispute sixth place with Detroit, but on May 1 the Browns found only New York between them and the basement.
10028{_}2074{_}In the middle of May the Yankees passed St. Louis and ran seventh in the race until July.
10028{_}2075{_}4.
10028{_}2076{_}But accident and injury, and the loss of Cree, shot the Yankees to pieces.
10028{_}2077{_}For nearly six weeks, however, it was a battle royal between New York and St. Louis to escape the last hole, but in the middle of August the Yankees again established their superiority, retaining seventh place until after the middle of September.
10028{_}2078{_}In the homestretch the new blood given Stovall enabled him to pull his men out of the last notch just before the schedule ran out.
10028{_}2079{_}This feat was soon forgotten in the defeat of the Browns by the Cardinals in their post-prandial series for the championship of the Mound City.
10028{_}2080{_}*       *       *       *       *  The year was not prolific of freak or record-breaking performances in the American League.
10028{_}2081{_}Walter Johnson of Washington, and Joe Wood of Boston were credited with sixteen straight victories, which raised the American League record in that respect from fourteen straight, formerly held by Jack Chesbro of the Yankees.
10028{_}2082{_}Mullin of Detroit and Hamilton of St. Louis added their names to the list of hurlers who have held opponents without a safe hit in nine innings.
10028{_}2083{_}Mullin performed his hitless feat against St. Louis and Hamilton retaliated by holding Detroit without a safety.
10028{_}2084{_}The number of games in which pitchers escaped with less than four hits against them was smaller than usual, however.
10028{_}2085{_}There were only seventy-eight shut-out games recorded last season by comparison with the American League's record of 145.
10028{_}2086{_}The longest game of the younger league's season lasted nineteen innings, Washington defeating Philadelphia in that combat 5 to 4, and it was played late in September when the two teams were scrapping for second place.
10028{_}2087{_}The American League record for overtime is twenty-four innings, held by Philadelphia and Boston.
10028{_}2088{_}There were a lot of slugging games in 1912, but not as many as during the season of 1911.
10028{_}2089{_}Philadelphia piled up the highest total, 25, in eight innings, but it was made against the semi-professional team which wore Detroit uniforms on the day the Tigers struck.
10028{_}2090{_}The highest genuine total of hits was twenty-three, made by the Athletics against New York pitchers.
10028{_}2091{_}The Athletics also run up the highest score of the league's season when they compounded twenty-four runs against Detroit In May.
10028{_}2092{_}The semi-monthly standing of the race by percentages follows:         STANDING OF CLUBS ON MAY 1.

10028{_}2151{_}If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.
10028{_}2152{_}Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.
10028{_}2153{_}You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

10028{_}2213{_}Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
10028{_}2214{_}It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
10028{_}2215{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10028{_}2216{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10028{_}2226{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.

10028{_}2237{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10028{_}2238{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10028{_}2239{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10028{_}2240{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10028{_}2241{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10028{_}2242{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10028{_}2243{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10028{_}2244{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10028{_}2245{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10028{_}2246{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:  http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10028{_}2247{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10028{_}2248{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10028{_}2249{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10028{_}2250{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10028{_}2251{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10028{_}2252{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10028{_}2253{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:  http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks: http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL  *** END: FULL LICENSE ***
