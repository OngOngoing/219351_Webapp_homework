10073-8{_}15{_}By GARLAND GREEVER      and      JOSEPH M. BACHELOR     TO  DANA H. FERRIN  WHOM THIS BOOK OWES MORE THAN A MERE DEDICATION CAN ACKNOWLEDGE     PREFACE  You should know at the outset what this book does _not_ attempt to do.
10073-8{_}16{_}It does not, save to the extent that its own special purpose requires, concern itself with the many and intricate problems of grammar, rhetoric, spelling, punctuation, and the like; or clarify the thousands of individual difficulties regarding correct usage.
10073-8{_}17{_}All these matters are important.
10073-8{_}18{_}Concise treatment of them may be found in THE CENTURY HANDBOOK OF WRITING and THE CENTURY DESK BOOK OF GOOD ENGLISH, both of which manuals are issued by the present publishers.
10073-8{_}19{_}But this volume confines itself to the one task of placing at your disposal the means of adding to your stock of words, of increasing your vocabulary.
10073-8{_}20{_}It does not assume that you are a scholar, or try to make you one.
10073-8{_}21{_}To be sure, it recognizes the ends of scholarship as worthy.
10073-8{_}22{_}It levies at every turn upon the facts which scholarship has accumulated.
10073-8{_}23{_}But it demands of you no technical equipment, nor leads you into any of those bypaths of knowledge, alluring indeed, of which the benefits are not immediate.
10073-8{_}24{_}For example, in Chapter V it forms into groups words etymologically akin to each other.
10073-8{_}25{_}It does this for an end entirely practical--namely, that the words you know may help you to understand the words you do not know.
10073-8{_}26{_}Did it go farther--did it account for minor differences in these words by showing that they sprang from related rather than identical originals, did it explain how and how variously their forms have been modified in the long process of their descent--it would pass beyond its strict utilitarian bounds.
10073-8{_}27{_}This it refrains from doing.
10073-8{_}28{_}And thus everything it contains it rigorously subjects to the test of serviceability.
10073-8{_}29{_}It helps you to bring more and more words into workaday harness--to gain such mastery over them that you can speak and write them with fluency, flexibility, precision, and power.
10073-8{_}30{_}It enables you, in your use of words, to attain the readiness and efficiency expected of a capable and cultivated man.
10073-8{_}31{_}There are many ways of building a vocabulary, as there are many ways of attaining and preserving health.
10073-8{_}32{_}Fanatics may insist that one should be cultivated to the exclusion of the others, just as health-cranks may declare that diet should be watched in complete disregard of recreation, sanitation, exercise, the need for medicines, and one's mental attitude to life.
10073-8{_}33{_}But the sum of human experience, rather than fanaticism, must determine our procedure.
10073-8{_}34{_}Moreover experience has shown that the various successful methods of bringing words under man's sway are not mutually antagonistic but may be practiced simultaneously, just as health is promoted, not by attending to diet one year, to exercise the next, and to mental attitude the third, but by bestowing wise and fairly constant attention on all.
10073-8{_}35{_}Yet it would be absurd to state that all methods of increasing one's vocabulary, or of attaining vigor of physique, are equally valuable.
10073-8{_}36{_}This volume offers everything that helps, and it yields space in proportion to helpfulness.
10073-8{_}37{_}Aside from a brief introductory chapter, a chapter (number X) given over to a list of words, and a brief concluding chapter, the subject matter of the volume falls into three main divisions.
10073-8{_}38{_}Chapters II and III are based on the fact that we must all use words in combination--must fling the words out by the handfuls, even as the accomplished pianist must strike his notes.
10073-8{_}39{_}Chapters IV and V are based on the fact that we must become thoroughly acquainted with individual words--that no one who scorns to study the separate elements of speech can command powerful and discriminating utterance.
10073-8{_}40{_}Chapters VI, VII, VIII, and IX are based on the fact that we need synonyms as our constant lackeys--that we should be able to summon, not a word that will do, but a word that will express the idea with precision.
10073-8{_}41{_}Exercises scattered throughout the book, together with five of the six appendices, provide well-nigh inexhaustible materials for practice.
10073-8{_}42{_}For be it understood, once for all, that this volume is not a machine which you can set going and then sit idly beside, the while your vocabulary broadens.
10073-8{_}43{_}Mastery over words, like worthy mastery of any kind whatsoever, involves effort for yourself.
10073-8{_}44{_}You can of course contemplate the nature and activities of the mechanism, and learn something thereby; but also you must work--work hard, work intelligently.
10073-8{_}45{_}As you cannot acquire health by watching a gymnast take exercise or a doctor swallow medicine or a dietician select food, so you cannot become an overlord of words without first fighting battles to subjugate them.
10073-8{_}46{_}Hence this volume is for you less a labor-saving machine than a collection and arrangement of materials which you must put together by hand.
10073-8{_}47{_}It assembles everything you need.
10073-8{_}48{_}It tags everything plainly.
10073-8{_}49{_}It tells you just what you must do.
10073-8{_}50{_}In these ways it makes your task far easier.
10073-8{_}51{_}_But the task is yours_.
10073-8{_}52{_}Industry, persistence, a fair amount of common sense--these three you must have.
10073-8{_}53{_}Without them you will accomplish nothing.
10073-8{_}54{_}Even with them--let the forewarning be candid--you will not accomplish everything.
10073-8{_}55{_}You cannot learn all there is to be learned about words, any more than about human nature.
10073-8{_}56{_}And what you do achieve will be, not a sudden attainment, but a growth.
10073-8{_}57{_}This is not the dark side of the picture.
10073-8{_}58{_}It is an honest avowal that the picture is not composed altogether of light.
10073-8{_}59{_}But as the result of your efforts an adequate vocabulary will some day be yours.
10073-8{_}60{_}Nor will you have to wait long for an earnest of ultimate success.
10073-8{_}61{_}Just as system will speedily transform a haphazard business into one which seizes opportunities and stops the leakage of profits, so will sincere and well-directed effort bring you promptly and surely into an ever-growing mastery of words.

10073-8{_}94{_}Reading Lists  INDEX     CENTURY VOCABULARY BUILDER   I      REASONS FOR INCREASING YOUR VOCABULARY   Sometimes a dexterous use of words appears to us to be only a kind of parlor trick.
10073-8{_}95{_}And sometimes it _is_ just that.
10073-8{_}96{_}The command of a wide vocabulary is in truth an accomplishment, and like any other accomplishment it may be used for show.
10073-8{_}97{_}But not necessarily.
10073-8{_}98{_}Just as a man may have money without "flashing" it, or an extensive wardrobe without sporting gaudy neckties or wearing a dress suit in the morning, so may he possess linguistic resources without making a caddish exhibition of them.
10073-8{_}99{_}Indeed the more distant he stands from verbal bankruptcy, the less likely he is to indulge in needless display.
10073-8{_}100{_}Again, glibness of speech sometimes awakens our distrust.
10073-8{_}101{_}We like actions rather than words; we prefer that character, personality, and kindly feelings should be their own mouthpiece.
10073-8{_}102{_}So be it.
10073-8{_}103{_}But there are thoughts and emotions properly to be shared with other people, yet incapable of being revealed except through language.
10073-8{_}104{_}It is only when language is insincere--when it expresses lofty sentiments or generous sympathies, yet springs from designing selfishness--that it justly arouses misgivings.
10073-8{_}105{_}Power over words, like power of any other sort, is for use, not abuse.
10073-8{_}106{_}That it sometimes is abused must not mislead us into thinking that it should in itself be scorned or neglected.
10073-8{_}107{_}Our contempt and distrust do not mean that our fundamental ideas about language are unsound.
10073-8{_}108{_}Beneath our wholesome dislike for shallow facility and insincerity of speech, we have a conviction that the mastery of words is a good thing, not a bad.
10073-8{_}109{_}We are therefore unwilling to take the vow of linguistic poverty.
10073-8{_}110{_}If we lack the ability to bend words to our use, it is from laziness, not from scruple.
10073-8{_}111{_}We desire to speak competently, but without affectation.
10073-8{_}112{_}We know that if our diction rises to this dual standard, it silently distinguishes us from the sluggard, the weakling, and the upstart.
10073-8{_}113{_}For such diction is not to be had on sudden notice, like a tailor-made suit.
10073-8{_}114{_}Nor can it, like such a suit, deceive anybody as to our true status.
10073-8{_}115{_}A man's utterance reveals what he is.
10073-8{_}116{_}It is the measure of his inward attainment.
10073-8{_}117{_}The assertion has been made that for a man to express himself freely and well in his native language is the surest proof of his culture.
10073-8{_}118{_}Meditate the saying.
10073-8{_}119{_}Can you think of a proof that is surer?
10073-8{_}120{_}But a man's speech does more than lend him distinction.
10073-8{_}121{_}It does more than reveal to others what manner of man he is.
10073-8{_}122{_}It is an instrument as well as an index.
10073-8{_}123{_}It is an agent--oftentimes indeed it is _the_ agent--of his influence upon others.
10073-8{_}124{_}How silly are those persons who oppose words to things, as if words were not things at all but air-born unrealities!
10073-8{_}125{_}Words are among the most powerful realities in the world.
10073-8{_}126{_}You vote the Republican ticket.
10073-8{_}127{_}Why?
10073-8{_}128{_}Because you have studied the issues of the campaign and reached a well-reasoned conclusion how the general interests may be served?
10073-8{_}129{_}Possibly.
10073-8{_}130{_}But nine times in ten it will be because of that _word_ Republican.
10073-8{_}131{_}You may believe that in a given instance the Republican cause or candidate is inferior; you may have nothing personally to lose through Republican defeat; yet you squirm and twist and seek excuses for casting a Republican ballot.
10073-8{_}132{_}Such is the power--aye, sometimes the tyranny--of a word.
10073-8{_}133{_}The word _Republican_ has not been selected invidiously.
10073-8{_}134{_}_Democrat_ would have served as well.
10073-8{_}135{_}Or take religious words--_Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Baptist, Lutheran,_ or what not.
10073-8{_}136{_}A man who belongs, in person or by proxy, to one of the sects designated may be more indifferent to the institution itself than to the word that represents it.
10073-8{_}137{_}Thus you may attack in his presence the tenets of Presbyterianism, for example, but you must be wary about calling the Presbyterian name.
10073-8{_}138{_}_Mother, the flag_--what sooner than an insult coupled with these terms will rouse a man to fight?
10073-8{_}139{_}But does that man kiss his mother, or salute the flag, or pay much heed to either?
10073-8{_}140{_}Probably not.
10073-8{_}141{_}Words not realities?
10073-8{_}142{_}With what realities must we more carefully reckon?
10073-8{_}143{_}Words are as dangerous as dynamite, as beneficent as brotherhood.
10073-8{_}144{_}An unfortunate word may mean a plea rejected, an enterprise baffled, half the world plunged into war.
10073-8{_}145{_}A fortunate word may open a triple-barred door, avert a disaster, bring thousands of people from jealousy and hatred into coöperation and goodwill.
10073-8{_}146{_}Nor is it solely on their emotional side that men may be affected by words.
10073-8{_}147{_}Their thinking and their esthetic nature also--their hard sense and their personal likes and dislikes--are subject to the same influence.
10073-8{_}148{_}You interview a potential investor; does he accept your proposition or not?
10073-8{_}149{_}A prospective customer walks into your store; does he buy the goods you show him?
10073-8{_}150{_}You enter the drawing room of one of the elite; are you invited again and again?
10073-8{_}151{_}Your words will largely decide--your words, or your verbal abstinence.
10073-8{_}152{_}For be it remembered that words no more than dollars are to be scattered broadcast for the sole reason that you have them.
10073-8{_}153{_}The right word should be used at the right time--and at that time only.
10073-8{_}154{_}Silence is oftentimes golden.
10073-8{_}155{_}Nevertheless there are occasions for us to speak.
10073-8{_}156{_}Frequent occasions.
10073-8{_}157{_}To be inarticulate _then_ may mean only embarrassment.
10073-8{_}158{_}It may--some day it will--mean suffering and failure.
10073-8{_}159{_}That we may make the most of the important occasions sure to come, we must have our instruments ready.
10073-8{_}160{_}Those instruments are words.
10073-8{_}161{_}He who commands words commands events--commands men.
10073-8{_}162{_}II      WORDS IN COMBINATION: SOME PITFALLS   You wish, then, to increase your vocabulary.
10073-8{_}163{_}Of course you must become observant of words and inquisitive about them.
10073-8{_}164{_}For words are like people: they have their own particular characteristics, they do their work well or ill, they are in good odor or bad, and they yield best service to him who loves them and tries to understand them.
10073-8{_}165{_}Your curiosity about them must be burning and insatiable.
10073-8{_}166{_}You must study them when they have withdrawn from the throng of their fellows into the quiescence of their natural selves.
10073-8{_}167{_}You must also see them and study them in action, not only as they are employed in good books and by careful speakers, but likewise as they fall from the lips of unconventional speakers who through them secure vivid and telling effects.
10073-8{_}168{_}In brief, you must learn word nature, as you learn human nature, from a variety of sources.
10073-8{_}169{_}Now in ordinary speech most of us use words, not as individual things, but as parts of a whole--as cogs in the machine of utterance by which we convey our thoughts and feelings.
10073-8{_}170{_}We do not think of them separately at all.
10073-8{_}171{_}And this instinct is sound.
10073-8{_}172{_}In our expression we are like large-scale manufacturing plants rather than one-man establishments.
10073-8{_}173{_}We have at our disposal, not one worker, but a multitude.
10073-8{_}174{_}Hence we are concerned with our employees collectively and with the total production of which they are capable.
10073-8{_}175{_}To be sure, our understanding of them as individuals will increase the worth and magnitude of our output.
10073-8{_}176{_}But clearly we must have large dealings with them in the aggregate.
10073-8{_}177{_}This chapter and the following, therefore, are given over to the study of words in combination.
10073-8{_}178{_}As in all matters, there is a negative as well as a positive side to be reckoned with.
10073-8{_}179{_}Let us consider the negative side first.
10073-8{_}180{_}<Tameness>  Correct diction is too often insipid.
10073-8{_}181{_}There is nothing wrong with it, but it does not interest us--it lacks character, lacks color, lacks power.
10073-8{_}182{_}It too closely resembles what we conceive of the angels as having-- impeccability without the warmth of camaraderie.
10073-8{_}183{_}Speech, like a man, should be alive.
10073-8{_}184{_}It need not, of course, be boisterous.
10073-8{_}185{_}It may be intense in a quiet, modest way.
10073-8{_}186{_}But if it too sedulously observes all the _Thou shalt not's_ of the rhetoricians, it will refine the vitality out of itself and leave its hearers unmoved.
10073-8{_}187{_}That is why you should become a disciple of the pithy, everyday conversationalist and of the rough-and-ready master of harangue as well as of the practitioner of precise and scrupulous discourse.
10073-8{_}188{_}Many a speaker or writer has thwarted himself by trying to be "literary."
10073-8{_}189{_}Even Burns when he wrote classic English was somewhat conscious of himself and made, in most instances, no extraordinary impression.
10073-8{_}190{_}But the pieces he impetuously dashed off in his native Scotch dialect can never be forgotten.
10073-8{_}191{_}The man who begins by writing naturally, but as his importance in the publishing world grows, pays more and more attention to felicities--to "style"--and so spoils himself, is known to the editor of every magazine.
10073-8{_}192{_}Any editorial office force can insert missing commas and semicolons, and iron out blunders in the English; but it has not the time, if indeed the ability, to instil life into a lifeless manuscript.
10073-8{_}193{_}A living style is rarer than an inoffensive one, and the road of literary ambition is strewn with failures due to "correctness."
10073-8{_}194{_}Cultivate readiness, even daring, of utterance.
10073-8{_}195{_}A single turn of expression may be so audacious that it plucks an idea from its shroud or places within us an emotion still quivering and warm.
10073-8{_}196{_}Sustained discourse may unflaggingly clarify or animate.
10073-8{_}197{_}But such triumphs are beyond the reach of those, whether speakers or writers, who are constantly pausing to grope for words.
10073-8{_}198{_}This does not mean that scrutiny of individual words is wasted effort.
10073-8{_}199{_}Such scrutiny becomes the basis indeed of the more venturesome and inspired achievement.
10073-8{_}200{_}We must serve our apprenticeship to language.
10073-8{_}201{_}We must know words as a general knows the men under him--all their ranks, their capabilities, their shortcomings, the details and routine of their daily existence.
10073-8{_}202{_}But the end for which we gain our understanding must be to hurl these words upon the enemy, not as disconnected units, but as battalions, as brigades, as corps, as armies.
10073-8{_}203{_}Dr. Johnson, one of the most effective talkers in all history, resolved early in life that, always, and whatever topic might be broached, he would on the moment express his thoughts and feelings with as much vigor and felicity as if he had unlimited leisure to draw on.
10073-8{_}204{_}And Patrick Henry, one of the few really irresistible orators, was wont to plunge headlong into a sentence and trust to God Almighty to get him out.
10073-8{_}205{_}EXERCISE - Tameness  1.
10073-8{_}206{_}Study Appendix I (The Drift of Our Rural Population Cityward).
10073-8{_}207{_}Do you regard it as written simply, with force and natural feeling?
10073-8{_}208{_}Or does it show lack of spontaneity?--suffer from an unnatural and self- conscious manner of writing?
10073-8{_}209{_}Is the style one you would like to cultivate for your own use?
10073-8{_}210{_}2.
10073-8{_}211{_}Express, if you can, in more vigorous language of your own, the thought of the editorial.
10073-8{_}212{_}3.
10073-8{_}213{_}Think of some one you have known who has the gift of racy colloquial utterance.
10073-8{_}214{_}Make a list of offhand, homely, or picturesque expressions you have heard him employ, and ask yourself what it is in these expressions that has made them linger in your memory.
10073-8{_}215{_}With them in mind, and with your knowledge of the man's methods of imparting his ideas vividly, try to make your version of the editorial more forceful still.
10073-8{_}216{_}4.
10073-8{_}217{_}Study Appendix 2 (Causes for the American Spirit of Liberty) as an example of stately and elaborate, yet energetic, discourse.
10073-8{_}218{_}The speech from which this extract is taken was delivered in Parliament in a vain effort to stay England from driving her colonies to revolt.
10073-8{_}219{_}Some of Burke's turns of phrase are extremely bold and original, as "The religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent and the Protestantism of the Protestant religion."
10073-8{_}220{_}Moreover, with all his fulness of diction, Burke could cleave to the heart of an idea in a few words, as "Freedom is to them [the southern slave-holders] not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege."

10073-8{_}231{_}It relies upon directness and plausibility of substance and style rather than temerity of phrase.
10073-8{_}232{_}Yet it never sags into tameness.
10073-8{_}233{_}Notice how everyday expressions ("My business was to hold my breath," "I took to my heels") add subtly to our belief that what Defoe is telling us is true.
10073-8{_}234{_}Notice also that such expressions ("the least capful of wind," "half dead with the water I took in," "ready to burst with holding my breath") without being pretentious may yet be forceful.
10073-8{_}235{_}Notice finally the naturalness and lift of the sinewy idioms ("I fetched another run," "I had no clothes to shift me," "I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck," "It wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off").

10073-8{_}241{_}<Slovenliness>  Though we are to recognize the advantage of working in the undress of speech rather than in stiffly-laundered literary linens, though we are not to despise the accessions of strength and of charm which we may obtain from the homely and familiar, we must never be careless.
10073-8{_}242{_}The man whose speech is slovenly is like the man who chews gum--unblushingly commonplace.
10073-8{_}243{_}We must struggle to maintain our individuality.
10073-8{_}244{_}We must not be a mere copy of everybody else.
10073-8{_}245{_}We must put into our words the cordiality we put into our daily demeanor.
10073-8{_}246{_}If we greeted friend or stranger carelessly, conventionally, we should soon be regarded as persons of no force or distinction.
10073-8{_}247{_}So of our speech and our writing.
10073-8{_}248{_}Nothing, to be sure, is more difficult than to give them freshness without robbing them of naturalness and ease.

10073-8{_}251{_}We shall acquire it as a chess or a baseball player acquires his skill--by long effort, hard practice.
10073-8{_}252{_}One thing to avoid is the use of words in loose, or fast-and-loose, senses.
10073-8{_}253{_}Do not say that owning a watch is a fine proposition if you mean that it is advantageous.

10073-8{_}263{_}To go a little late is just the article.
10073-8{_}264{_}Another thing to avoid is the use of words in the wrong parts of speech, as a noun for a verb, or an adjective for an adverb.
10073-8{_}265{_}Sometimes newspapers are guilty of such faults; for journalistic English, though pithy, shows here and there traces of its rapid composition.
10073-8{_}266{_}You must look to more leisurely authorities.
10073-8{_}267{_}The speakers and writers on whom you may rely will not say "to burglarize," "to suspicion," "to enthuse," "plenty rich," "real tired," "considerable discouraged," "a combine," or "humans."
10073-8{_}268{_}An exhaustive list of such errors cannot be inserted here.
10073-8{_}269{_}If you feel yourself uncertain in these details of usage, you should have access to such a volume as _The Century Desk Book of Good English_.

10073-8{_}279{_}Another thing to avoid is triteness.

10073-8{_}284{_}Above all, you must rid yourself of any dependence upon them.
10073-8{_}285{_}The scope of this book permits only a few illustrations of the kinds of words and phrases meant.
10073-8{_}286{_}But the person who speaks of "lurid flames," or "untiring efforts," or "specimens of humanity"--who "views with alarm," or has a "native heath," or is "to the manner born"--does more than advertise the scantness of his verbal resources.

10073-8{_}288{_}EXERCISE - Slovenliness III  Replace with more original expressions the trite phrases (italicized) in the following sentences:  _Last but not least_, we have _in our midst_ one who began life _poor but honest_.
10073-8{_}289{_}After we had _done justice to a dinner_ and gathered in the drawing room, we listened _with bated breath_ while she _favored us with a selection_.

10073-8{_}298{_}Hoping you are the same_, I remain Yours sincerely, Ned Burke.
10073-8{_}299{_}Finally, to the extent that you use slang at all, be its master instead of its slave.
10073-8{_}300{_}You have many times been told that the overuse of slang disfigures one's speech and hampers his standing with cultivated people.
10073-8{_}301{_}You have also been told that slang constantly changes, so that one's accumulations of it today will be a profitless clutter tomorrow.
10073-8{_}302{_}These things are true, but an even more cogent objection remains.
10073-8{_}303{_}Slang is detrimental to the formation of good intellectual habits.
10073-8{_}304{_}From its very nature it cannot be precise, cannot discriminate closely.
10073-8{_}305{_}It is a vehicle for loose-thinking people, it is fraught with unconsidered general meanings, it moves in a region of mental mists.
10073-8{_}306{_}It could not flourish as it does were fewer of us content to express vague thoughts and feelings instead of those which are sharply and specifically ours.
10073-8{_}307{_}Unless, therefore, you wish your intellectual processes to be as hazy and haphazard as those of mental shirkers and loafers, you must eschew, not necessarily all slang, but all heedless, all habitual use of it.
10073-8{_}308{_}Now and then a touch of slang, judiciously chosen, is effective; now and then it fulfils a legitimate purpose of language.
10073-8{_}309{_}But normally you should express yourself as befits one who has at his disposal the rich treasuries of the dictionary instead of a mere stock of greasy counterfeit phrases.
10073-8{_}310{_}EXERCISE - Slovenliness IV  Replace the following slang with acceptable English:  We pulled a new wrinkle.
10073-8{_}311{_}He's an easy mark.
10073-8{_}312{_}Oh, you're nutty.

10073-8{_}316{_}What a phiz the bloke has!
10073-8{_}317{_}You're talking through your hat.
10073-8{_}318{_}We had a long confab with the gink.

10073-8{_}324{_}Nix on the rough stuff.
10073-8{_}325{_}And there I got pinched by a cop for parking my Tin Lizzie.
10073-8{_}326{_}<Wordiness>  As a precaution against tameness you should cultivate spontaneity and daring.
10073-8{_}327{_}As a precaution against slovenliness you should cultivate freshness and accuracy.
10073-8{_}328{_}But to display spontaneity, daring, freshness, accuracy you must have or acquire a large stock, a wide range, of words.
10073-8{_}329{_}Now this possession, like any other, brings with it temptation.
10073-8{_}330{_}If we have words, we like to use them.
10073-8{_}331{_}Nor do we wait for an indulgence in this luxury until we have consciously set to work to amass a vocabulary.
10073-8{_}332{_}Verbosity is, in truth, the besetting linguistic sin.
10073-8{_}333{_}Most people are lavish with words, as most people are lavish with money.
10073-8{_}334{_}This is not to say that in the currency of language they are rich.
10073-8{_}335{_}But even if they lack the means--and the desire--to be extravagant, they yet make their purchases heedlessly or fail to count their linguistic change.
10073-8{_}336{_}The degree of our thrift, not the amount of our income or resources, is what marks us as being or not being verbal spendthrifts.
10073-8{_}337{_}The frugal manager buys his ideas at exactly the purchase price.
10073-8{_}338{_}He does not expend a twenty-dollar bill for a box of matches.
10073-8{_}339{_}Have words by all means, the more of them the better, but use them temperately, sparingly.
10073-8{_}340{_}Do not think that a passage to be admirable must be studded with ostentatious terms.
10073-8{_}341{_}Consider the Gettysburg Address or the Parable of the Prodigal Son.
10073-8{_}342{_}These convey their thought and feeling perfectly, yet both are simple--exquisitely simple.
10073-8{_}343{_}They strike us indeed as being inevitable--as if their phrasing could not have been other than it is.
10073-8{_}344{_}They have, they are, finality.
10073-8{_}345{_}What could glittering phraseology add to them?
10073-8{_}346{_}Nothing; it could only mar them.
10073-8{_}347{_}Yet Lincoln and the Scriptural writers were not afraid to use big words when occasion required.
10073-8{_}348{_}What they sought was to make their speech adequate without carrying a superfluous syllable.
10073-8{_}349{_}"The sun set" is more natural and effective than "The celestial orb that blesses our terrestrial globe with its warm and luminous rays sank to its nocturnal repose behind the western horizon."
10073-8{_}350{_}Great writers--the true masters--have often held "fine writing" and pretentious speaking up to ridicule.
10073-8{_}351{_}Thus Shakespeare has Kent, who has been rebuked for his bluntness, indulge in a grandiloquent outburst:    "Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,   Under the allowance of your grand aspect,   Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire   On flickering Phoebus' front,--"  No wonder Kent is interrupted with a "What meanest by this?"
10073-8{_}352{_}Sometimes great writers use ornate utterance for humorous effects.
10073-8{_}353{_}Thus Dickens again and again has Mr. Micawber express a commonplace idea in sounding terms which at length fail him, so that he must interject an "in short" and summarize his meaning in a phrase amusing through its homely contrast.
10073-8{_}354{_}But humor based on ponderous diction is too often wearisome.
10073-8{_}355{_}Better say simply "He died," or colloquially "He kicked the bucket," than "He propelled his pedal extremities with violence against the wooden pail which is customarily employed in the transportation of the aquatic fluid."
10073-8{_}356{_}EXERCISE - Wordiness I  Express these ideas in simpler language:  The temperature was excessive.
10073-8{_}357{_}The most youthful of his offspring was not remarkable for personal pulchritude.
10073-8{_}358{_}Henry Clay expressed a preference for being on the right side of public questions to occupying the position of President of the United States of America.
10073-8{_}359{_}He who passes at an accelerated pace may nevertheless be capable of perusing.
10073-8{_}360{_}A masculine member of the human race was mounted on an equine quadruped.
10073-8{_}361{_}But the number of the terms we employ, as well as their ostentatiousness, must be considered.
10073-8{_}362{_}Most of us blunder around in the neighborhood of our meaning instead of expressing it briefly and clearly.
10073-8{_}363{_}We throw a handful of words at an idea when one word would suffice; we try to bring the idea down with a shotgun instead of a rifle.
10073-8{_}364{_}Of course one means of correction is that we should acquire accuracy, a quality already discussed.
10073-8{_}365{_}Another is that we should practice condensation.
10073-8{_}366{_}First, let us learn to omit the words which add nothing to the meaning.
10073-8{_}367{_}Thus in the sentence "An important essential in cashing a check is that you should indorse it on the back," several words or groups of words needlessly repeat ideas which are expressed elsewhere.
10073-8{_}368{_}The sentence is as complete in substance, and far terser in form, when it reads "An essential in cashing a check is that you should indorse it."
10073-8{_}369{_}Next, let us, when we may, reduce phrases and even clauses to a word.
10073-8{_}370{_}Thus the clause at the beginning and the phrase at the close of the following sentence constitute sheer verbiage: "Men who have let their temper get the better of them are often in a mood to do harm to somebody."
10073-8{_}371{_}The sentence tells us nothing that may not be told in five words: "Angry men are often dangerous."
10073-8{_}372{_}Finally, let us substitute phrases or clauses for unnecessary sentences.
10073-8{_}373{_}The following series of independent assertions contains avoidable repetitions: "One morning I was riding on the subway to my work.
10073-8{_}374{_}It was always my custom to ride to my work on the subway.
10073-8{_}375{_}This morning I met Harry Blake."
10073-8{_}376{_}The full thought may better be embodied in a single sentence: "One morning, while I was, as usual, riding on the subway to my work, I met Harry Blake."
10073-8{_}377{_}By applying these instructions to any page at hand--one from your own writing, one from a letter some friend has sent you, one from a book or magazine--you will often be able to strike out many of the words without at all impairing the meaning.
10073-8{_}378{_}Another means of acquiring succinct expression is to practice the composition of telegrams and cable messages.
10073-8{_}379{_}You will of course lessen the cost by eliminating every word that can possibly be spared.
10073-8{_}380{_}On the other hand, you must bear it in mind that your punctuation will not be transmitted, and that the recipient must be absolutely safeguarded against reading together words meant to be separated or separating words meant to be read together.
10073-8{_}381{_}That is, your message must be both concise and unmistakably clear.
10073-8{_}382{_}EXERCISE - Wordiness II  1.
10073-8{_}383{_}Condense the editorial (Appendix 1) by eliminating unnecessary words and finding briefer equivalents for roundabout expressions.
10073-8{_}384{_}2.
10073-8{_}385{_}Try to condense similarly the Parable of the Sower (Appendix 3) and the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4).
10073-8{_}386{_}(The task will largely or altogether baffle you, but will involve minute study of tersely written passages.)
10073-8{_}387{_}3.
10073-8{_}388{_}Condense the following:  A man whose success in life was due solely to his own efforts rose in his place and addressed the man who presided over the meeting.
10073-8{_}389{_}A girl who sat in the seat behind me giggled in an irritating manner.
10073-8{_}390{_}We heard the wild shriek of the locomotive.
10073-8{_}391{_}Any sound in that savage region seemed more terrible than it would in civilized surroundings.
10073-8{_}392{_}So as we listened to the shriek of the locomotive, it sounded terrible too.
10073-8{_}393{_}I heard what kind of chauffeur he was.
10073-8{_}394{_}A former employer of his told me.
10073-8{_}395{_}He was a chauffeur who speeded in reckless fashion because he was fond of having all the excitement possible.
10073-8{_}396{_}4.
10073-8{_}397{_}Condense the following into telegrams of ten words or less:  Arrived here in Toledo yesterday morning talked with the directors found them not hostile to us but friendly.
10073-8{_}398{_}Detectives report they think evidence now points to innocence of man arrested and to former employee as the burglar.
10073-8{_}399{_}5.
10073-8{_}400{_}The following telegrams are ambiguous.
10073-8{_}401{_}Clarify them.
10073-8{_}402{_}Jane escaped illness I feared Charley better.
10073-8{_}403{_}Buy oil if market falls sell cotton.
10073-8{_}404{_}6.
10073-8{_}405{_}Base a telegraphic night letter of not more than fifty words upon these circumstances:  (a) You have been sent to buy, if possible and as cheaply as possible, a majority of the stock in a given company.
10073-8{_}406{_}You find that many of the stockholders distrust or dislike the president and are willing to sell.
10073-8{_}407{_}Some of these ask only $50 a share for their holdings; the owners of 100 shares want as much as $92; the average price asked is $76.
10073-8{_}408{_}By buying out all the president's enemies, which you can now do beyond question, you would secure a bare majority of the stock.
10073-8{_}409{_}But $92 a share seems to you excessive; that is, you think that by working quietly among the president's friends you can get 100 shares at $77 or thereabouts and thus save approximately $1500.
10073-8{_}410{_}On the other hand, should your dealings with the friends of the president give him premature warning, he might stop the sales by these friends and himself begin buying from his enemies, and thus make your purchase of a majority of the stock impossible.
10073-8{_}411{_}Is the $1500 you would save worth the risk you would be obliged to take?
10073-8{_}412{_}You call for instructions.
10073-8{_}413{_}(b) You are telegraphing a metropolitan paper the results of a Congressional election.
10073-8{_}414{_}Philput, the Republican candidate, leads in the cities, from which returns are now complete.
10073-8{_}415{_}Wilkins, the Democratic candidate, leads in the country, from only certain districts of which-- those nearest the cities--returns have been heard.
10073-8{_}416{_}If the present proportionate division of the rural vote is maintained for the total, Philput will be elected by a plurality of three hundred votes.
10073-8{_}417{_}Philput asserts that the proportions will hold.
10073-8{_}418{_}Wilkins points out, however, that he is relatively stronger in the more remote districts and predicts that he will have a plurality of seven hundred votes.
10073-8{_}419{_}Smallbridge, an independent candidate, is apparently making a better race in the country than in the city, but he is so weak in both places that the ballots cast for him can scarcely affect the outcome unless the margin of victory is infinitesimal.
10073-8{_}420{_}7.
10073-8{_}421{_}Compress 6a and 6b each into a telegram of not more than ten words.
10073-8{_}422{_}8.
10073-8{_}423{_}(Do not read this assignment until you have composed the night letters and telegrams called for in 6 and 7.)

10073-8{_}428{_}_Telegram_: Wire whether buy safe or risk control saving fifteen hundred.
10073-8{_}429{_}(Ten words.)
10073-8{_}430{_}A final device for escaping wordiness you will have discovered for yourself while composing telegrams and telegraphic night letters.
10073-8{_}431{_}It is to pass over details not vital to your purpose.
10073-8{_}432{_}Of course you must have due regard for circumstances; details needed for one purpose may be superfluous for another.
10073-8{_}433{_}But all of us are familiar with the person who loses her ideas in a rigmarole of prosaic and irrelevant facts.
10073-8{_}434{_}Such a person is Shakespeare's scatter-brained Dame Quickly.
10073-8{_}435{_}On one occasion this voluble woman is shrilly reproaching Sir John Falstaff for his indebtedness to her.
10073-8{_}436{_}"What is the gross sum that I owe thee?"
10073-8{_}437{_}he inquires.
10073-8{_}438{_}She might answer simply: "If thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too.
10073-8{_}439{_}Thou didst promise to marry me.
10073-8{_}440{_}Deny it if thou canst."
10073-8{_}441{_}Instead, she plunges into a prolix recital of the circumstances of the engagement, so that the all-important fact that the engagement exists has no special emphasis in her welter of words.
10073-8{_}442{_}"If thou wert an honest man," she cries, "thyself and the money too.
10073-8{_}443{_}Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife.
10073-8{_}444{_}Canst thou deny it?
10073-8{_}445{_}Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly?
10073-8{_}446{_}coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound?
10073-8{_}447{_}And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people; saying that ere long they should call me madam?
10073-8{_}448{_}And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings?
10073-8{_}449{_}I put thee now to thy book-oath; deny it if thou canst."
10073-8{_}450{_}EXERCISE - Wordiness III  1.
10073-8{_}451{_}Study the following paragraph, decide which ideas are important, and strike out the details that merely clog the thought:  As I stepped into the room, I heard the clock ticking and that caused me to look at it.
10073-8{_}452{_}It sits on the mantelpiece with some layers of paper under one corner where the mantel is warped.
10073-8{_}453{_}When the papers slip out or we move the clock a little as we're dusting, the ticking stops right away.
10073-8{_}454{_}Of course the clock's not a new one at all, but it's an old one.
10073-8{_}455{_}It has been in the family for many a long year, yes, from even before my father's time.
10073-8{_}456{_}Let me see, it was bought by my grandfather.
10073-8{_}457{_}No, it couldn't have been grandfather that bought it; it was his brother.
10073-8{_}458{_}Oh, yes, I remember now; my mother told me all about it, and I'd forgotten what she said till this minute.
10073-8{_}459{_}But really my grandfather's brother didn't exactly buy it.
10073-8{_}460{_}He just traded for it.
10073-8{_}461{_}He gave two pigs and a saddle, that's what my mother said.
10073-8{_}462{_}You see, he was afraid his hogs might take cholera and so he wanted to get rid of them; and as for the saddle, he had sold his riding-horse and he didn't have any more use for that.
10073-8{_}463{_}Well, it isn't a valuable clock, like a grandfather clock or anything of that sort, though it is antique.
10073-8{_}464{_}As I was saying, when I glanced at it, it read seven minutes to six.
10073-8{_}465{_}I remember the time very well, for just then the factory whistle blew and I remember saying to myself: "It's seven minutes slow today."
10073-8{_}466{_}You see, it's old and we don't keep it oiled, and so it's always losing time.
10073-8{_}467{_}Hardly a day passes but I set it up--sometimes twice a day, as for the matter of that--and I usually go by the factory whistle too, though now and then I go by Dwight's gold watch.
10073-8{_}468{_}Well, anyhow, that tells me what time it was.
10073-8{_}469{_}I'm certain I can't be wrong.
10073-8{_}470{_}2.
10073-8{_}471{_}Study, on the other hand, The Castaway (Appendix 5) for its judicious use of details.
10073-8{_}472{_}Defoe in his stories is a supreme master of verisimilitude (likeness to truth).
10073-8{_}473{_}As we read him, we cannot help believing that these things actually happened.
10073-8{_}474{_}More than in anything else the secret of his lifelikeness lies in his constant faithfulness to reality.
10073-8{_}475{_}He puts in the little mishaps that would have befallen a man so situated, the things he would have done, the difficulties he might have avoided had he exercised forethought.
10073-8{_}476{_}Though Defoe had little insight into the complexities of man's inner life, he has not been surpassed in his accumulations of naturalistic outer details.
10073-8{_}477{_}These do not cumber his narrative; they contribute to its purpose and add to its effectiveness.
10073-8{_}478{_}In this selection (Appendix 5) observe how plausible are such homely details as Crusoe's seeing no sign of his comrades "except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows"; as his difficulty in getting aboard the ship again; and as his having his clothes washed away by the rising of the tide.
10073-8{_}479{_}Find half a dozen other such incidents that You consider especially effective.
10073-8{_}480{_}<Verbal Discords>  We may pitch our talk or our writing in almost any I key we choose.
10073-8{_}481{_}Our mood may be dreamy or eager or hilarious or grim or blustering or somber or bantering or scornful or satirical or whatever we will.
10073-8{_}482{_}But once we have established the tone, we should not--except sometimes for broadly humorous effects--change it needlessly or without clear forewarning.
10073-8{_}483{_}If we do, we create a one or the other of two obstacles, or both of them, for whoever is trying to follow what we say.
10073-8{_}484{_}In the first place, we obscure our meaning.
10073-8{_}485{_}For example, we have; been speaking ironically and suddenly swerve into serious utterance; or we have been speaking seriously and then incongruously adopt an ironic tone.
10073-8{_}486{_}How are our listeners, our readers to take us?
10073-8{_}487{_}They are puzzled; they do not know.
10073-8{_}488{_}In the second place, we offend--perhaps in insidious, indefinable fashion--the esthetic proprieties; we violate the natural fitness of things.
10073-8{_}489{_}For example, we have been speaking with colloquial freedom, sprinkling our discourse with _shouldn't_ and _won't;_ suddenly we be come formal and say _should not_ and will _not_.
10073-8{_}490{_}Our meaning is as obvious as before, but the verbal harmony has been interrupted; our hearers or readers are uneasily aware of a break in the unity of tone.
10073-8{_}491{_}A speaker or writer is a host to verbal guests.
10073-8{_}492{_}When he invites them to his assembly, he gives each the tacit assurance that it will not be brought into fellowship with those which in one or another of a dozen subtle ways will be uncongenial company for it.
10073-8{_}493{_}He must never be forgetful of this unspoken promise.
10073-8{_}494{_}If he is to avoid a linguistic breach, he must constantly have his wits about him; must study out his combinations carefully, and use all his knowledge, all his tact.
10073-8{_}495{_}He will make due use of spontaneous impulse; but that this may be wise and disciplined, he will form the habit of curiosity about words, their stations, their savor, their aptitudes, their limitations, their outspokenness, their reticences, their affinities and antipathies.
10073-8{_}496{_}Thus when he has need of a phrase to fill out a verbal dinner party, he will know which one to select.
10073-8{_}497{_}Certain broad classifications of words are manifest even to the most obtuse user of English.
10073-8{_}498{_}_Shady, behead_, and _lying_ are "popular" words, while their synonyms _umbrageous_ decapitate,_ and _mendacious_ are "learned" words.
10073-8{_}499{_}_Flabbergasted_ and _higgledy-piggledy_ are "colloquial," while _roseate_ and _whilom_ are "literary."
10073-8{_}500{_}_Affidavit, allegro_, _lee shore_, and _pinch hit_ are "technical," while _vamp_, _savvy, bum hunch_, and _skiddoo_ are "slang."
10073-8{_}501{_}It would be disenchanting indeed were extremes of this sort brought together.
10073-8{_}502{_}But offenses of a less glaring kind are as hard to shut out as February cold from a heated house.
10073-8{_}503{_}Unusual are the speeches or compositions, even the short ones, in which every word is in keeping, is in perfect tune with the rest.
10073-8{_}504{_}For the attainment of this ultimate verbal decorum we should have to possess knowledge almost unbounded, together with unerring artistic instinct.
10073-8{_}505{_}But diction of a kind only measurably inferior to this is possible to us if we are in earnest.
10073-8{_}506{_}To attain it we must study the difference between abstract and concrete terms, and let neither intrude unadvisedly upon the presence or functions of the other; do the same by literal and figurative terms and instruct ourselves in the nature and significance of connotation.
10073-8{_}507{_}Before considering these more detailed matters, however, we may pause for a general exercise on verbal harmony.
10073-8{_}508{_}EXERCISE - Discords  1.
10073-8{_}509{_}Study the editorial in Appendix 1 for unforewarned changes in mood and assemblages of mutually uncongenial words.
10073-8{_}510{_}Rewrite the worst two paragraphs to remove all blemishes of these kinds.
10073-8{_}511{_}2.
10073-8{_}512{_}Compare Burke's speech (Appendix 2) with Defoe's narrative (Appendix 5) for the difference in tone between them.
10073-8{_}513{_}Does each keep the tone it adopts (that is, except for desirable changes)?
10073-8{_}514{_}3.
10073-8{_}515{_}Note the changes in tone in the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4).
10073-8{_}516{_}Do the changes in substance, make these changes in tone desirable?
10073-8{_}517{_}4.
10073-8{_}518{_}In the following passages, make such changes and omissions as are necessary to unify the tone:  How I loved to stroll, on those long Indian summer afternoons, into the quiet meadows where the mild-breathed kine were grazing!
10073-8{_}519{_}An old cow that switches her tail at flies and puts her foot in the bucket when you milk her, I absolutely loathe.
10073-8{_}520{_}How I loved to hear the birds sing, to listen to the fall of ripe autumnal apples!
10073-8{_}521{_}It wasn't the girl yclept Sally.
10073-8{_}522{_}This girl was not so vivacious as Sally, but she had a mug on her that was a lot less ugly to look at.
10073-8{_}523{_}Gee, when she stood there in front of me with those mute, ineffable, sympathetic eyes of hers, I was ready to throw a duck-fit.
10073-8{_}524{_}Old Grimes is dead, that dear old soul;   We'll never see him more;   He wore a great long overcoat,   All buttoned down before.
10073-8{_}525{_}<I.
10073-8{_}526{_}Abstract vs.
10073-8{_}527{_}Concrete Terms; General vs.
10073-8{_}528{_}Specific Terms>  Abstract terms convey ideas; concrete terms call up pictures.
10073-8{_}529{_}If we say "Honesty is the best policy," we speak abstractly.
10073-8{_}530{_}Nobody can see or hear or touch the thing _honesty_ or the thing _policy_; the apprehension of them must be purely intellectual.
10073-8{_}531{_}But if we say "The rat began to gnaw the rope," we speak concretely.
10073-8{_}532{_}_Rat_, _gnaw_, and _rope_ are tangible, perceptible things; the words bring to us visions of particular objects and actions.
10073-8{_}533{_}Now when we engage in explanations and discussions of principles, theories, broad social topics, and the like--when we expound, moralize, or philosophize,--our subject matter is general.
10073-8{_}534{_}We approach our readers or hearers on the thinking, the rational side of their natures.
10073-8{_}535{_}Our phraseology is therefore normally abstract.
10073-8{_}536{_}But when, on the other hand, we narrate an event or depict an appearance, our subject matter is specific.
10073-8{_}537{_}We approach our readers or hearers on the sensory or emotional side of their natures.
10073-8{_}538{_}Our phraseology is therefore normally concrete.
10073-8{_}539{_}You should be able to express yourself according to either method.
10073-8{_}540{_}You should be able to choose the words best suited to make people understand; also to choose the words best suited to make people realize vividly and feel.
10073-8{_}541{_}Now to some extent you will adopt the right method by intuition.
10073-8{_}542{_}But if you do not reinforce your intuition with a careful study of words, you will vacillate from one method to the other and strike crude discords of phrasing.
10073-8{_}543{_}Of course if you switch methods intelligently and of purpose, that is quite another matter.
10073-8{_}544{_}An abstract discussion may be enlivened by a concrete illustration.
10073-8{_}545{_}A concrete narrative or portrayal may be given weight and rationalized by generalization.
10073-8{_}546{_}Moreover many things lie on the borderland between the two domains and may properly be attached to either.
10073-8{_}547{_}Thus the abstraction is legitimate when you say or write: "A man wishes to acquire the comforts and luxuries, as well as the necessaries, of life."
10073-8{_}548{_}The concreteness is likewise legitimate when you say or write: "John Smith wishes to earn cake as well as bread and butter."
10073-8{_}549{_}In most instances general terms are the same as abstract, and specific the same as concrete.
10073-8{_}550{_}Some subtle discriminations may, however, be made.
10073-8{_}551{_}Of these the only one that need concern us here is that the wording of a passage may not be abstract and yet be general.
10073-8{_}552{_}Suppose, for example, you were telling the story of the prodigal son and should say: "He was very hungry, and could; not obtain food anywhere.
10073-8{_}553{_}When he had come to his senses, he thought, 'I should be better off at home.'"
10073-8{_}554{_}This language is not abstract, but it is general rather than specific.
10073-8{_}555{_}When Jesus told the story, he wished to put the situation as poignantly as possible and therefore avoided both abstract and general terms: "And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
10073-8{_}556{_}And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
10073-8{_}557{_}Many a person who shuns abstractions and talks altogether of the concrete things of life, yet traps out circumstance in general rather than specific terms.
10073-8{_}558{_}To do this is always to sacrifice force.
10073-8{_}559{_}EXERCISE - Abstract  1.
10073-8{_}560{_}Discuss as abstractly as possible such topics as those listed in Activity 1 for EXERCISE - Discourse, or as the following:  Is there any such thing as luck?
10073-8{_}561{_}Is the Golden Rule practicable in the modern business world?
10073-8{_}562{_}Is modesty rather than self-assertion regarding his own merits and abilities the better policy for an employee?
10073-8{_}563{_}Are substantial, home-keeping girls or girls rather fast and frivolous the more likely to obtain good husbands?
10073-8{_}564{_}Is it desirable for a young man to take out life insurance?
10073-8{_}565{_}Is self-education better than collegiate training?
10073-8{_}566{_}Should one always tell the truth?
10073-8{_}567{_}2.
10073-8{_}568{_}Discuss as concretely as possible the topics you have selected from 1.
10073-8{_}569{_}Use illustrations drawn from life.
10073-8{_}570{_}3.
10073-8{_}571{_}Restate in concrete terms such generalizations as the following:  Experience is the best teacher.
10073-8{_}572{_}Self-preservation is the first law of nature.
10073-8{_}573{_}To him who in the love of nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language.
10073-8{_}574{_}Necessity is the mother of invention.
10073-8{_}575{_}The bravest are the tenderest.

10073-8{_}580{_}Compare the abstract statement "Truths and high ethical principles are received by various men in various ways" with the concrete presentation of the same idea in Appendix 3.
10073-8{_}581{_}Which expression of the thought would be the more easily understood by the average person?
10073-8{_}582{_}Why?
10073-8{_}583{_}Which would you yourself remember the longer?
10073-8{_}584{_}Why?
10073-8{_}585{_}5.
10073-8{_}586{_}Compare the statement "The second period of a human being's life is that of his reluctant attendance at school" with Shakespeare's picture of the schoolboy in Appendix 4.
10073-8{_}587{_}6.
10073-8{_}588{_}Burke, near the close of his speech (Appendix 2), presents an idea, first in general terms, and then in specific terms, thus: "No contrivance can prevent the effect of...distance in weakening government.
10073-8{_}589{_}Seas roll, and months pass, between the order and the execution, and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat a whole system."
10073-8{_}590{_}Find elsewhere in Burke's speech and in the editorial (Appendix I) general assertions which may be made more forceful by restatement in specific terms, and supply these specific restatements.
10073-8{_}591{_}7.
10073-8{_}592{_}State in your own words the general thought or teaching of the Parable of the Prodigal Son.
10073-8{_}593{_}(_Luke_ 15: 11-24.)
10073-8{_}594{_}8.
10073-8{_}595{_}Make the following statements more concrete:  In front of our house was a tree that at a certain season of the year displayed highly colored foliage.
10073-8{_}596{_}A celebrated orator said: "Give me liberty, or give me death!"
10073-8{_}597{_}On the table were some viands that assailed my nostrils agreeably and others that put into my mouth sensations of anticipated enjoyment.
10073-8{_}598{_}From this window above the street I can hear a variety of noises by day and a variety of different noises by night.

10073-8{_}602{_}A stitch in time saves nine.
10073-8{_}603{_}A cat may look at a king.
10073-8{_}604{_}A barking dog never bites.
10073-8{_}605{_}If his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
10073-8{_}606{_}If two men ride a horse, one must ride behind.
10073-8{_}607{_}Stone walls do not a prison make.
10073-8{_}608{_}A merry heart goes all the day.
10073-8{_}609{_}Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just.

10073-8{_}611{_}10.
10073-8{_}612{_}Describe a town as seen from a particular point of view, or at a particular time of day, or under particular atmospheric conditions.
10073-8{_}613{_}Make your description as concrete as possible.
10073-8{_}614{_}11.
10073-8{_}615{_}Compare your description with this from Stevenson: "The town came down the hill in a cascade of brown gables, bestridden by smooth white roofs, and spangled here and there with lighted windows."
10073-8{_}616{_}Stevenson's sentence contains twenty-five words.
10073-8{_}617{_}How many of them are "color" words?
10073-8{_}618{_}How many "motion" words?
10073-8{_}619{_}How many of the first twenty-five words in your description appeal to one or another of the five senses?
10073-8{_}620{_}12.
10073-8{_}621{_}Narrate as vividly as possible an experience in your own life.
10073-8{_}622{_}Compare what you have written with the account of Crusoe's escape to the island (Appendix 5).
10073-8{_}623{_}Which narrative is the more concrete?
10073-8{_}624{_}How much?
10073-8{_}625{_}<2.
10073-8{_}626{_}Literal vs. Figurative Terms>  Phraseology is literal when it says exactly what it means; is figurative when it says one thing, but really means another.
10073-8{_}627{_}Thus "He fought bravely" is literal; "He was a lion in the fight" is figurative.
10073-8{_}628{_}Literal phraseology as a rule appeals to our scientific or understanding faculties; figurative to our emotional faculties.
10073-8{_}629{_}Here again, as with abstraction and concreteness, you should learn to express yourself by either method.
10073-8{_}630{_}Both have their advantages and their drawbacks.
10073-8{_}631{_}We all admire the man who has observed, and can state, accurately.
10073-8{_}632{_}It is upon this belief of ours in the literal that Defoe shrewdly traffics.
10073-8{_}633{_}(See Appendix 5.)
10073-8{_}634{_}He does not stir us as some writers do, but he gains our implicit confidence.
10073-8{_}635{_}Dame Quickly, on the contrary, makes egregious use of the literal.
10073-8{_}636{_}(See paragraph above EXERCISE - Wordiness III above.)
10073-8{_}637{_}Her facts are accurate, yes; but how strictly, how unsparingly accurate!
10073-8{_}638{_}And how many of them are beside the point!
10073-8{_}639{_}She quite convinces us that the devotee of the literal may be dull.
10073-8{_}640{_}An advantage of the figurative also is that it may make meanings lucid.
10073-8{_}641{_}Thus when Burke near the close of his discussion (Appendix 2) wishes to make it clear that by a law of nature the authority of extensive empires is slighter in its more remote territories, he has recourse to a figure of speech: "In large bodies, the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremities.
10073-8{_}642{_}Nature has said it."
10073-8{_}643{_}More often, however, the function of the figurative is to drive home a thought or a mood of which a mere statement would leave us unmoved--to make us _feel_ it.
10073-8{_}644{_}Thus Burke said of the Americans "Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing."
10073-8{_}645{_}He added: "Here they felt its pulse, and as they found that beat they thought themselves sick or sound."
10073-8{_}646{_}Had you been one of his Parliamentary hearers, would not that second sentence have made more real and more important the colonial attitude to taxation?
10073-8{_}647{_}The poets of course make frequent and noble use of the figurative.
10073-8{_}648{_}This is how Coleridge tells us that the descent of a tropical night is sudden:    "The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;   At one stride comes the dark."
10073-8{_}649{_}The words _rush out_ and _at one stride comes_ convert the stars and the darkness into vast beings or at least vast personal forces; the comparisons are so natural as to seem inevitable; we are transported to the very scene and feel the overwhelming abruptness of the nightfall.
10073-8{_}650{_}But if a figure of speech seems artificial, if it is strained or far-fetched or merely decorative, it subtracts from the effectiveness of the passage.
10073-8{_}651{_}Thus when Tennyson says:    "When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free   In the silken sail of infancy."
10073-8{_}652{_}we must stop and ponder before we perceive that what he means is "When I was a happy child."
10073-8{_}653{_}The figure is like an exotic plant rather than a natural outgrowth of the soil; it appears to us something thought up and stuck on; it is a parasite rather than a helper.
10073-8{_}654{_}Of course, as with abstraction and concreteness, you should develop facility in gliding from literalness to figurativeness and back again.
10073-8{_}655{_}But you are always to remember that your gymnastics are not to militate against verbal concord.
10073-8{_}656{_}You must never set words scowling and growling at each other through injudicious combinations like this: "She was five feet, four and three-quarter inches high, had a small, round scar between her nose and her left cheek-bone, and moved with the lissom and radiant grace of a queen."
10073-8{_}657{_}EXERCISE - Literal  1.
10073-8{_}658{_}Give the specifications for a house you intend to build.
10073-8{_}659{_}2.
10073-8{_}660{_}Make a list of comparisons (as to a nest, a haven, a goal) to show what such a house might mean in the life of a man.
10073-8{_}661{_}Expand as many of these comparisons as you can, but do not carry the process to absurd lengths.
10073-8{_}662{_}(In the figure of the nest you may mention the parent birds, their activities, the nestlings; in the figure of the haven you may mention the quiet, sheltered waters in contrast to the turbulent billows outside; in the figure of the goal you may mention the struggle necessary to reach it.)
10073-8{_}663{_}3.
10073-8{_}664{_}Describe the looks of the house.
10073-8{_}665{_}Use as many figures of speech as you can.
10073-8{_}666{_}If you can find no appropriate figures, at least make your words specific.
10073-8{_}667{_}4.
10073-8{_}668{_}Give a surveyor's or a tax assessor's or a conveyancer's description of a piece of land.
10073-8{_}669{_}Then describe the land through figures of speech which will vivify its outward appearance or its emotional significance to the owner.
10073-8{_}670{_}5.
10073-8{_}671{_}Observe that the Parable of the Sower (Appendix 3) is an extended figure of speech.
10073-8{_}672{_}Is the main figure effective?
10073-8{_}673{_}Are its detailed applications effective?
10073-8{_}674{_}6.
10073-8{_}675{_}The Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4) is also an extended figure of speech.
10073-8{_}676{_}Does it, as Shakespeare intends, bring vividly to your consciousness the course, motives, stages, evolution of a human being's life?
10073-8{_}677{_}There are several subsidiary figures.
10073-8{_}678{_}Do these add force, definiteness to the picture Shakespeare is drawing at that moment?
10073-8{_}679{_}7.
10073-8{_}680{_}Observe from Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and the sentences listed in Activity 9 for EXERCISE - Abstract above, that a thing meant to be concrete is likely to be stated figuratively.
10073-8{_}681{_}8.
10073-8{_}682{_}Examine The Castaway (Appendix 5) for its proportionate use of literal and figurative elements.
10073-8{_}683{_}See Activity 2 of EXERCISE - Wordiness III above for a statement of Defoe's purpose.
10073-8{_}684{_}Could he have effected this purpose so well had he employed more figures of speech?
10073-8{_}685{_}9.
10073-8{_}686{_}Examine Appendix 2 for its use of figures.
10073-8{_}687{_}Are the figures appropriate to the subject matter?
10073-8{_}688{_}Are there enough of them?
10073-8{_}689{_}10.
10073-8{_}690{_}Galvanize the thought of any sentence or paragraph in editorial (Appendix 1) by the use of a figure of speech.
10073-8{_}691{_}11.
10073-8{_}692{_}Summarize or illustrate your opinion on any of the topics listed in Activity 1 for EXERCISE - Discourse, through the employment of figure of speech.
10073-8{_}693{_}12.
10073-8{_}694{_}Are these figures effective?
10073-8{_}695{_}Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
10073-8{_}696{_}The flower of our young manhood is scaling the ladder of success.
10073-8{_}697{_}Fair as a star, when only one   Is shining in the sky.
10073-8{_}698{_}Silence, like a poultice, comes   To heal the blows of sound.
10073-8{_}699{_}In my head   Many thoughts of trouble come,   Like to flies upon a plum!
10073-8{_}700{_}Let me tell you first about those barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas-like eye.
10073-8{_}701{_}The day is done, and the darkness   Falls from the wings of night,   As a feather is wafted downward   From an eagle in his flight.
10073-8{_}702{_}Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
10073-8{_}703{_}Life, like a dome of many-colored glass,   Stains the white radiance of eternity.
10073-8{_}704{_}Mountains stood out like pimples or lay like broken welts across the habitable ground.
10073-8{_}705{_}Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player   That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,   And then is heard no more; it is a tale   Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,   Signifying nothing.
10073-8{_}706{_}I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like winter's withered leaves.
10073-8{_}707{_}13.
10073-8{_}708{_}Recast the following sentences to eliminate the clashing of literal and figurative elements:  Life is like a rich treasure entrusted to us, and to sustain it we must have three square meals a day.
10073-8{_}709{_}She glanced at the mirror, but did not really see herself.
10073-8{_}710{_}She was trying to puzzle out the right course, and could only see as through a glass darkly.
10073-8{_}711{_}Arming himself with the sword of zeal and the buckler of integrity, he wrote the letter.
10073-8{_}712{_}He swept the floor every morning, and was a ray of sunshine in the office.
10073-8{_}713{_}He also emptied the waste baskets and cleaned the cuspidors.
10073-8{_}714{_}<3.
10073-8{_}715{_}Connotation>  The connotation of a word is the subtle implication, the emotional association it carries--often quite apart from its dictionary definition.
10073-8{_}716{_}Thus the words _house_ and _home_ in large measure overlap in meaning, but emotionally they are not equivalents at all.
10073-8{_}717{_}You can say _house_ without experiencing any sensation whatever, but if you utter the word _home_ it will call back, however slightly, tender and cherished recollections.
10073-8{_}718{_}_Bald heads_ and _gray hair_ are both indicative of age; but you would pronounce the former in disparaging allusion to elderly persons, and the latter with sentiments of veneration.
10073-8{_}719{_}You would say, of a clodpole that he plays the _fiddle_, but of Fritz Kreisler that he plays the _violin_.
10073-8{_}720{_}And just as you unconsciously adapt words to feelings in these obvious instances, you must learn, on peril of striking false notes verbally, to do so when distinctions are less gross.
10073-8{_}721{_}Moreover circumstance as well as sentiment may control the connotation of a word.
10073-8{_}722{_}A word or phrase may have a double or triple connotation, and depend upon vocal inflection, upon gesture, upon the words with which it is linked, upon the experience of speaker or hearer, upon time, place, and external fact, or upon other forces outside it for the sense in which it is to be taken.
10073-8{_}723{_}You may be called "old dog" in an insulting manner, or (especially if a slap on the shoulder accompanies the phrase) in an affectionate manner.
10073-8{_}724{_}You may properly say, "Calhoun had logic on his side"; add, however, the words "but his face was to the past," and you spoil the sentence,--for _face_ gives a reflex connotation to _side_, slight perhaps and momentary, but disconcerting.
10073-8{_}725{_}Think over the funny stories you have heard.
10073-8{_}726{_}Many of them turn, you will find, on the outcropping of new significance in a phrase because of its environment.
10073-8{_}727{_}Thus the anecdote of the servant who had been instructed to summon the visiting English nobleman by tapping on his bedroom door and inquiring, "My lord, have you yet risen?"
10073-8{_}728{_}and who could only stammer, "My God!
10073-8{_}729{_}ain't you up yet?"
10073-8{_}730{_}Or the anecdote of the minister who in a sermon on the Parable of the Prodigal Son told how a young man living dissolutely in a city had been compelled to send to the pawnbroker first his overcoat, next his suit, next his silk shirt, and finally his very underclothing--"and then," added the minister, "he came to himself."
10073-8{_}731{_}Only by unresting vigilance can you evade verbal discords, if not of this magnitude, at least of much frequency and stylistic harm.
10073-8{_}732{_}EXERCISE - Connotation  1.
10073-8{_}733{_}Note the contrast in emotional suggestion that comes to you from hearing the words:  "Sodium chloride" and "salt" "A test-tube of H2O" and "a cup of cold water" "A pair of brogans" and "a little empty shoe" "Bump" and "collide" "A brilliant fellow" and "a flashy fellow" "Bungled it" and "did not succeed" "Tumble" and "fall" "Dawn" and "6 A.M." "Licked" and "worsted" "Fat" and "plump" "Wept" and "blubbered" "Cheek" and "self-assurance" "Stinks" and "disagreeable odors" "Steal" and "embezzle" "Thievishness" and "kleptomania" "Educated" and "highbrow" "Job" and "Position" "Told a lie" and "fell into verbal inexactitude" "A drunkard" (a stranger) and "a drunkard" (your father).

10073-8{_}737{_}Read the sentences listed in EXERCISE - Slovenliness III and IV.
10073-8{_}738{_}What do these sentences suggest to you as to the social and mental qualifications of the person who employs them?
10073-8{_}739{_}4.
10073-8{_}740{_}Read the second paragraph of Appendix 2.
10073-8{_}741{_}What does it suggest to you as to Burke's social and mental qualifications?
10073-8{_}742{_}5.
10073-8{_}743{_}Suppose you were told that a passage of twenty-eight lines contains the following expressions: "mewling and puking," "whining schoolboy," "satchel," "sighing like furnace," "round belly," "spectacles on nose," "shrunk shank," "sans [without] teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
10073-8{_}744{_}Would you believe the passage is poetry?--that its total effect is one of poetic elevation?
10073-8{_}745{_}Read the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4).
10073-8{_}746{_}_Is_ it poetry?
10073-8{_}747{_}How does Shakespeare reconcile the general poetic tone with such expressions as those quoted?
10073-8{_}748{_}6.
10073-8{_}749{_}What is wrong with the connotation of the following?
10073-8{_}750{_}The servant told us that the young ladies were all in.
10073-8{_}751{_}All my poor success is due to you.
10073-8{_}752{_}He insisted on carrying a revolver, and so the college authorities fired him.
10073-8{_}753{_}The carpenter too had his castles in Spain.
10073-8{_}754{_}He rested his old bones by the wayside, and his gaunt dog stood sniffing at them.
10073-8{_}755{_}On the other hand, he had a white elephant to dispose of.
10073-8{_}756{_}When he came to the forks of the road, he showed he was not on the square.

10073-8{_}762{_}The music, yearning like a god in pain.
10073-8{_}763{_}Alone, alone, all, all alone,     Alone on a wide, wide sea!
10073-8{_}764{_}But O for the touch of a vanished hand,   And the sound of a voice that is still!
10073-8{_}765{_}Old, unhappy, far-off things,     And battles long ago.
10073-8{_}766{_}It was night in the lonesome October.
10073-8{_}767{_}How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,     In the icy air of night!
10073-8{_}768{_}While the stars, that oversprinkle     All the heavens, seem to twinkle     With a crystalline delight.
10073-8{_}769{_}The moan of doves in immemorial elms,   And murmuring of innumerable bees.
10073-8{_}770{_}Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;   To lie in cold obstruction and to rot.

10073-8{_}772{_}'Tis as easy now for the heart to be true   As for grass to be green or skies to be blue,--   'Tis the natural way of living.
10073-8{_}773{_}We are such stuff   As dreams are made of, and our little life   Is rounded with a sleep.
10073-8{_}774{_}8.
10073-8{_}775{_}With the most connotative words at your command describe the following:  Your first sweetheart A solemn experience A ludicrous experience A terrifying experience A mysterious experience The circus parade you saw in your boyhood A servant girl A dude An odd character you have known The old homestead Your boarding house A scene suggesting the intense heat of a midsummer day Night on the river The rush for the subway car The traffic policeman Your boss Anything listed in the first part of Activity 9 of EXERCISE - Discourse.
10073-8{_}776{_}III      WORDS IN COMBINATION: HOW MASTERED   The more dangerous pitfalls for those who use words in combination--as all of us do--have been pointed out.
10073-8{_}777{_}The best ways of avoiding these pitfalls have also been indicated.
10073-8{_}778{_}But our work together has thus far been chiefly negative.
10073-8{_}779{_}To be sure, many tasks assigned for your performance have been constructive as well as precautionary; but _the end_ held ever before you has been the avoidance of feeble or ridiculous diction.
10073-8{_}780{_}In the present chapter we must take up those aspects of the mastery of words in combination which are primarily positive.
10073-8{_}781{_}<Preliminaries: General Purposes and Methods>  Before coming to specific aspects and assignments, however, we shall do well to consider certain large general purposes and methods.
10073-8{_}782{_}<I.
10073-8{_}783{_}A Ready, an Accurate, or a Wide Vocabulary?>  First, what kind of vocabulary do we wish to acquire?
10073-8{_}784{_}A facile, readily used one?
10073-8{_}785{_}An accurate one?
10073-8{_}786{_}Or one as nearly as may be comprehensive?
10073-8{_}787{_}The three kinds do not necessarily coexist.
10073-8{_}788{_}The possession of one may even hinder and retard the acquisition of another.
10073-8{_}789{_}Thus if we seek a ready vocabulary, an accurate vocabulary may cause us to halt and hesitate for words which shall correspond with the shadings of our thought and emotion, and a wide vocabulary may embarrass us with the plenitude of our verbal riches.
10073-8{_}790{_}But _may_ is not _must_.
10073-8{_}791{_}Though the three kinds of vocabulary may interfere with each other, there is no reason, except superficially, why they should.
10073-8{_}792{_}Our purpose should be, therefore, to acquire not a single kind but all three.
10073-8{_}793{_}We should be like the boy who, when asked whether he would have a small slice of apple pie or a small slice of pumpkin pie, replied resolutely, "Thank you, I will take a large piece of both."
10073-8{_}794{_}That the assignments in this chapter may help you develop a vocabulary which shall be promptly responsive to your needs, you should perform some of them rapidly.
10073-8{_}795{_}Your thoughts and feelings regarding a topic may be anything but clear, but you must not pause to clarify them.
10073-8{_}796{_}The words best suited to the matter may not be instantly available, but you must not tarry for accessions of language.
10073-8{_}797{_}Stumble, flounder if you must, yea, rearrange your ideas even as you present them, but press resolutely ahead, comforting yourself with the assurance that in the heat and stress of circumstances a man rarely does his work precisely as he wishes.
10073-8{_}798{_}When you have finished the discussion, repeat it immediately--and with no more loitering than before.
10073-8{_}799{_}You will find that your ideas have shifted and enlarged, and that more appropriate words have become available.
10073-8{_}800{_}Further repetitions will assist you the more.
10073-8{_}801{_}But the goal you should set yourself, as you proceed from topic to topic, is the attainment of the power to be at your best in the first discussion.
10073-8{_}802{_}You may never reach this goal, but at least you may approach it.
10073-8{_}803{_}That the assignments in this chapter may assist you in making your vocabulary accurate, you should perform some of them in another way.
10073-8{_}804{_}When you have selected a topic, you should first of all think it through.
10073-8{_}805{_}In doing this, arrange your ideas as consistently and logically as you can, and test them with your reason.
10073-8{_}806{_}Then set them forth in language which shall be lucid and exact.
10073-8{_}807{_}Tolerate no slipshod diction, no vaguely rendered general meanings.
10073-8{_}808{_}Send every sentence, every word like a skilful drop-kick--straight above the crossbar.
10073-8{_}809{_}When you have done your best with the topic, lay it by for a space.
10073-8{_}810{_}Time is a great revealer of hidden defects, and you must not regard your labors as ended until your achievement is the maturest possible for you.
10073-8{_}811{_}If the quantity of what you accomplish is meager, suffer no distress on that account.
10073-8{_}812{_}The desideratum now is not quantity, but quality.
10073-8{_}813{_}The assignments in this chapter will do less toward making your vocabulary wide than toward making it facile and precise.
10073-8{_}814{_}To be sure, they will now and then set you to hunting for words that are new.
10073-8{_}815{_}Better still, they will give you a mastery over some of your outlying words--words known to your eyes or ears but not to your tongue.
10073-8{_}816{_}But these advantages will be somewhat incidental.
10073-8{_}817{_}Means for the systematic extension of your verbal domain into regions as yet unexplored by you, are reserved for the later chapters of this book.
10073-8{_}818{_}<2.
10073-8{_}819{_}A Vocabulary for Speech or for Writing?>  In the second place, are we to develop a vocabulary for oral discourse or a vocabulary for writing?
10073-8{_}820{_}It may be that our chief impediment or our chief ambition lies in one field rather than in the other.
10073-8{_}821{_}Nevertheless we should strive for a double mastery; we ought to speak well _and_ write well.
10073-8{_}822{_}Indeed the two powers so react upon each other that we ought to cultivate both for the sake of either.
10073-8{_}823{_}True, some men, though inexpert as writers, have made themselves proficient as speakers; or though shambling and ineffective as speakers, have made themselves proficient as writers.
10073-8{_}824{_}But this is not natural or normal.
10073-8{_}825{_}Moreover these men might have gleaned more abundantly from their chosen field had they not shut it off from the acres adjacent.
10073-8{_}826{_}Fences waste space and curtail harvests.
10073-8{_}827{_}The assignments in this chapter are of such a nature that you may perform them either orally or in writing.
10073-8{_}828{_}You should speak and write alternately, sometimes on the same topic, sometimes on topics taken in rotation.
10073-8{_}829{_}In your oral discussions you should perhaps absent yourself at first from human auditors.
10073-8{_}830{_}A bedstead or a dresser will not make you self-conscious or in any way distract your attention, and it will permit you to sit down afterward and think out the degree of your failure or success.
10073-8{_}831{_}Ultimately, of course, you must speak to human beings--in informal conversations at the outset, in more ambitious ways later as occasion permits.
10073-8{_}832{_}In your writing you may find it advantageous to make preliminary outlines of what you wish to say.
10073-8{_}833{_}But above all, you must be willing to blot, to revise, to take infinite pains.
10073-8{_}834{_}You should remember the old admonition that easy reading is devilish hard writing.
10073-8{_}835{_}<The Mastery of Words in Combination>  These purposes and methods are general.
10073-8{_}836{_}We now come to the specific fields in which we may with profit cultivate words in combination.
10073-8{_}837{_}Of these fields there are four.
10073-8{_}838{_}<I.
10073-8{_}839{_}Mastery through Translation>  If you read a foreign language, whether laboriously or with ease, you should make this power assist you to amass a good English vocabulary.
10073-8{_}840{_}Take compositions or parts of compositions written in the foreign tongue, and turn them into idiomatic English.
10073-8{_}841{_}How much you should translate at a given time depends upon your leisure and your adeptness.
10073-8{_}842{_}Employ all the methods--the spontaneous, the carefully perfected, the oral, the written--heretofore explained in this chapter.
10073-8{_}843{_}In your final work on a passage you should aim at a faultless rendition, and should spend time and ransack the lexicons rather than come short of this ideal.
10073-8{_}844{_}The habit of translation is an excellent habit to keep up.
10073-8{_}845{_}For the study of an alien tongue not only improves your English, but has compensations in itself.
10073-8{_}846{_}EXERCISE - Translation  1.
10073-8{_}847{_}Translate from any accessible book in the foreign language you can read.
10073-8{_}848{_}2.
10073-8{_}849{_}Subscribe for a period of at least two or three months for a newspaper or magazine in that language, if it is a modern one.
10073-8{_}850{_}Translate as before, but give most of your time to rapid oral translation for a real or imaginary American hearer.
10073-8{_}851{_}3.
10073-8{_}852{_}When you have completed your final written translation of a passage from the foreign language, make yourself master of all the English words you have not previously (1) known or (2) used, but have encountered in your work of translation.
10073-8{_}853{_}<2.
10073-8{_}854{_}Mastery through Paraphrasing>  It may be that you are not familiar with a foreign language.
10073-8{_}855{_}At any rate you have some knowledge of English.
10073-8{_}856{_}Put this knowledge to use in paraphrasing; for thus you will enrich your vocabulary and make it surer and more flexible.
10073-8{_}857{_}The process of paraphrasing is simple, though the actual work is not easy.
10073-8{_}858{_}You take passages written in English--the more of them the better, and the more diversified the better--and both reproduce their substance and incarnate their mood in words you yourself shall choose.
10073-8{_}859{_}You may have a passage before you and paraphrase it unit by unit.
10073-8{_}860{_}More often, however, you should follow the plan adopted by Franklin when he emulated Addison by rewriting the _Spectator Papers_.
10073-8{_}861{_}That is, you should steep yourself in the thought and emotion of a piece of writing, and then lay the piece aside until its wording has faded from your memory, when you should reëmbody the substance in language that seems to you natural and fitting.
10073-8{_}862{_}Much of the benefit will come from your comparing your version, as Franklin did his, with the original.
10073-8{_}863{_}When you perceive that you have fallen short, you should consider the respects wherein your inferiority lies--and should make another attempt, and yet another, and another.
10073-8{_}864{_}When you perceive that in any way you have surpassed the original, you should feel a just pride in your achievement--and should resolve that next time your cause for pride shall be greater still.
10073-8{_}865{_}Even after you have desisted from formal paraphrasing, you should cling to the habit, formed at this time, of observing any notable felicities in whatever you read and of comparing them with the expression you yourself would likely have employed.
10073-8{_}866{_}EXERCISE - Paraphrasing  1.
10073-8{_}867{_}Paraphrase the editorial in Appendix 1.
10073-8{_}868{_}You should improve upon the original.
10073-8{_}869{_}Keep trying until you do.
10073-8{_}870{_}2.
10073-8{_}871{_}Paraphrase the second paragraph in Burke's speech (Appendix 2).
10073-8{_}872{_}Burke lacked the cheap tricks of the ordinary orator, but his discussions were based upon a comprehensive knowledge of facts, a sympathetic understanding of human nature, a vast depth and range of thought, and a well-meditated political philosophy.
10073-8{_}873{_}In short, he is a model for _elaborated_ discussions.
10073-8{_}874{_}Set forth the leading thought of this paragraph; you can give it in fewer words than he employs.
10073-8{_}875{_}But try setting it forth with his full accompaniments of reflection and information; you will be bewildered at his crowding so much into such small compass.
10073-8{_}876{_}3.

10073-8{_}886{_}<3.
10073-8{_}887{_}Mastery through Discourse at First Hand>  Models have their use, but you can also work without models.
10073-8{_}888{_}It is imperative that you should.
10073-8{_}889{_}You must learn to discuss, explain, analyze, argue, narrate, and describe for yourself.
10073-8{_}890{_}Here again you should diversify your materials to the utmost, not only that you may become well-rounded and versatile in your ability to set forth ideas and feelings in words, but also that your knowledge and your sensibility may receive stimulation.
10073-8{_}891{_}It is feasible to begin by discussing or explaining.
10073-8{_}892{_}Most of the intercourse conducted through language consists in either discussion or explanation.
10073-8{_}893{_}Analysis, ordinarily, is almost ignored.
10073-8{_}894{_}Argument is indulged in, and so is description (though less freely), but they are of the bluntest and broadest.
10073-8{_}895{_}Narration--the recounting of incidents of everyday existence--is, however, widely employed.
10073-8{_}896{_}In your work of discussion or explanation you may seize upon any current topic--industrial, social, political, or what not--that comes into your mind.
10073-8{_}897{_}Or you may make a list of such topics, writing each on a separate piece of paper; may jumble the slips in a hat; and may thus have always at your elbow a collection of satisfactory themes from which you may take one at random.
10073-8{_}898{_}Or you may invest in language of your own selection the substance of an address or sermon you have heard, or give the burden of some important conversation in which you have participated, or explain the tenor of an article you have read.
10073-8{_}899{_}You should of course try to interest your hearers, and above all, you should impart to what you say complete clarity.
10073-8{_}900{_}In analyzing you should select as your topic a process fairly obscure, the implications of a certain statement or argument, the results to be expected from some action or policy that has been advocated, or the exact matter at issue between two disputants.
10073-8{_}901{_}Any topic for discussion, explanation, or argument may be treated analytically.
10073-8{_}902{_}Your analysis in its final form should be so carefully considered that its soundness cannot be impeached.
10073-8{_}903{_}In arguing you may take any subject under the sun, from baseball to Bolshevism, for all of them are debated with vehemence.
10073-8{_}904{_}Any topic for discussion or explanation becomes, when approached from some particular angle, material for argument.
10073-8{_}905{_}Thus the initial topic in the exercise that follows is "The aeroplane's future as a carrier of mail."
10073-8{_}906{_}You may convert it into a question for debate by making it read: "The aeroplane is destined to supplant the railroad as a carrier of mail," or "The aeroplane is destined to be used increasingly as a carrier of transcontinental mail."
10073-8{_}907{_}In arguing you may propose for ourself either of two objectives: (1) to silence your opponent, (2) to refute, persuade, and win him over fairly.
10073-8{_}908{_}The achievement of the first end calls for bluster and perhaps a grim, barbaric strength; you must do as Johnson did according to Goldsmith's famous dictum--if your pistol misses fire, you must knock your adversary down with the butt end of it.
10073-8{_}909{_}This procedure, though inartistic to be sure, is in some contingencies the only kind that will serve.
10073-8{_}910{_}But you should cultivate procedure of a type more urbane.
10073-8{_}911{_}Let your very reasonableness be the most potent weapon you wield.
10073-8{_}912{_}To this end you should form the habit of looking for good points on both sides of a question.
10073-8{_}913{_}As a still further precaution against contentiousness you should uphold the two sides successively.
10073-8{_}914{_}In narrating you should, as a rule, stick to simple occurrences, though you may occasionally vary your work by summarizing the plot of a novel or giving the gist and drift of big historical events.
10073-8{_}915{_}You should confine yourself, in large part, to incidents in which you have been personally involved, or which you yourself have witnessed, as mishaps, unexpected encounters, bickerings, even rescues or riots.
10073-8{_}916{_}You should omit non-essentials and make the happening itself live for your hearer; if you can so interest him in it that he will not notice your manner of telling it, your success is but the greater.
10073-8{_}917{_}Finally, in describing you should deal for the most part with beings, objects, and appearances familiar to you.
10073-8{_}918{_}Description is usually hard to make vivid.
10073-8{_}919{_}This is because the objects and scenes are likely to be immobile and (at least when told about) to lack distinctiveness.
10073-8{_}920{_}Try, therefore, to lay hold of the peculiar quality of the thing described, and use words suggestive of color and motion.
10073-8{_}921{_}Moreover be brief.
10073-8{_}922{_}Long descriptions are sure to be wearisome.

10073-8{_}969{_}Mastery through Adapting Discourse to Audience>  For convenience, we have heretofore assumed that ideas and emotions, together with such expression of them as shall be in itself adequate and faithful, comprise the sole elements that have to be reckoned with in the use of words in combination.
10073-8{_}970{_}But as you go out into life you will find that these things, however complete they may seem, are not in practice sufficient.
10073-8{_}971{_}Another factor--the human--must have its place in our equation.
10073-8{_}972{_}You do not speak or write in a vacuum.
10073-8{_}973{_}Your object, your ultimate object at least, in building up your vocabulary is to address men and women; and among men and women the varieties of training, of stations, of outlooks, of sentiments, of prejudices, of caprices are infinite.
10073-8{_}974{_}To gain an unbiased hearing you must take persistent cognizance of flesh and blood.
10073-8{_}975{_}In adapting discourse to audience you must have a supple and attentive mind and an impressionable and swiftly responsive temperament as well as a wide, accurate, and flexible vocabulary.
10073-8{_}976{_}Unless you are a fool, a zealot, or an incorrigible adventurer, you will not broach a subject at all to which your hearers feel absolute indifference or hostility.
10073-8{_}977{_}Normally you should pick a subject capable of interesting them.
10073-8{_}978{_}In presenting it you should pay heed to both your matter and your manner.
10073-8{_}979{_}You should emphasize for your listeners those aspects of the subject which they will most respond to or most need to hear, whether or not the phases be such as you would emphasize with other auditors.
10073-8{_}980{_}You should also speak in the fashion you deem most effective with them, whether or not it be one to which your own natural instincts prompt you.
10073-8{_}981{_}Let us say you are discussing conditions in Europe.
10073-8{_}982{_}You must speak in one way to the man who has traveled and in an entirely different way to the man who has never gone abroad--in one way to the well-read man, in an entirely different way to the ignoramus.
10073-8{_}983{_}Let us say you are discussing urban life, urban problems.
10073-8{_}984{_}You must speak in one way to the man who lives in the city, in another to the man who lives in the country.
10073-8{_}985{_}Let us say you are discussing the labor problem.
10073-8{_}986{_}You must speak in one way to employers, in another to employees, possibly in a third to men thrown out of jobs, possibly in a fourth to the general public.
10073-8{_}987{_}Let us say you are discussing education, or literature, or social tendencies, or mechanical principles or processes, or some great enterprise or movement.
10073-8{_}988{_}You must speak in one way to cultivated hearers and in another to men in the street, and if you are a specialist addressing specialists, you will cut the garment of your discourse to their particular measure.
10073-8{_}989{_}The same principle holds regardless of whether you expound, analyze, argue, recount, or describe.
10073-8{_}990{_}You must always keep a finger on the mental or emotional pulse of those whom you address.
10073-8{_}991{_}But your problem varies slightly with the form of discourse you adopt.
10073-8{_}992{_}In explanation, analysis, and argument the chief barriers you encounter are likely to be those of the mind; you must make due allowance for the intellectual limitations of your auditors, though many who have capacity enough may for some cause or other be unreceptive to ideas.
10073-8{_}993{_}In description you must reckon with the imaginative faculty, with the possibility that your hearers cannot visualize what you tell them--and you must make your words brief.
10073-8{_}994{_}In narration you must vivify emotional torpor; but lest in your efforts to inveigle boredom you yourself should induce it, you must have a wary eye for signals of distress.

10073-8{_}1047{_}IV      INDIVIDUAL WORDS: AS VERBAL CELIBATES   Thus far we have studied words as grouped together into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, whole compositions.
10073-8{_}1048{_}We must now enter upon a new phase of our efforts to extend our vocabulary.
10073-8{_}1049{_}We must study words as individual entities.
10073-8{_}1050{_}You may think the order of our study should be reversed.
10073-8{_}1051{_}No great harm would result if it were.
10073-8{_}1052{_}The learning of individual words and the combining of them into sentences are parallel rather than successive processes.
10073-8{_}1053{_}In our babyhood we do not accumulate a large stock of terms before we frame phrases and clauses.
10073-8{_}1054{_}And our attainment of the power of continuous iteration does not check our inroads among individual words.
10073-8{_}1055{_}We do the two things simultaneously, each contributing to our success with the other.
10073-8{_}1056{_}There are plenty of analogies for this procedure.
10073-8{_}1057{_}A good baseball player, for instance, tirelessly studies both the minutiae of his technique (as how to hold a bat, how to stand at the plate) and the big combinations and possibilities of the game.
10073-8{_}1058{_}A good musician keeps unremitting command over every possible touch of each key and at the same time seeks sweeping mastery over vast and complex harmonies.
10073-8{_}1059{_}So we, if we would have the obedience of our vocabularies, dare not lag into desultory attention to either words when disjoined or words as potentially combined into the larger units of thought and feeling.
10073-8{_}1060{_}We might therefore consider either the individuals first or the groups first.
10073-8{_}1061{_}But the majority of speakers and writers pay more heed to rough general substance than to separate instruments and items.
10073-8{_}1062{_}Hence we have thought best to begin where most work is going on already--with words in combination.
10073-8{_}1063{_}As you turn from the groups to the individuals, you must understand that your labors will be onerous and detailed.
10073-8{_}1064{_}You must not assume that by nature all words are much alike, any more than you assume that all men are much alike.
10073-8{_}1065{_}Of course the similarities are many and striking, and the fundamental fact is that a word is a word as a man is a man.
10073-8{_}1066{_}But you will be no adept in handling either the one or the other until your knowledge goes much farther than this.
10073-8{_}1067{_}Let us glance first at the human variations.
10073-8{_}1068{_}Each man has his own business, and conducts it in his own way--a way never absolutely matched with that of any other mortal being.
10073-8{_}1069{_}All this you may see.
10073-8{_}1070{_}But besides the man's visible employment, he may be connected in devious fashions with a score of enterprises the public knows nothing about.
10073-8{_}1071{_}Furthermore he leads a private life (again not precisely corresponding to that of any other), has his hobbies and aversions, is stamped with a character, a temperament of his own.
10073-8{_}1072{_}In short, though in thousands of respects he is like his fellows, he has after all no human counterpart; he is a distinct, individual self.
10073-8{_}1073{_}To know him, to use him, to count upon his service in whatsoever contingency it might bestead you, you must deem him something more than a member of the great human family.
10073-8{_}1074{_}You must cultivate him personally, cultivate him without weariness or stint, and undergo inconvenience in so doing.
10073-8{_}1075{_}Even so with a word.
10073-8{_}1076{_}Commonplace enough it may seem.
10073-8{_}1077{_}But it has its peculiar characteristics, its activities undisclosed except to the curious, its subtle inclinations, its repugnances, its latent potentialities.
10073-8{_}1078{_}There is no precise duplicate for it in all the wide domain of language.
10073-8{_}1079{_}To know it intimately and thoroughly, to be on entirely free terms with it, to depend upon it just so far as dependence is safe, to have a sure understanding of what it can do and what it cannot, you must arduously cultivate it.
10073-8{_}1080{_}Words, like people, yield themselves to the worthy.
10073-8{_}1081{_}They hunger for friendship--and lack the last barrier of reserve which hedges all human communion.
10073-8{_}1082{_}Thus, linguistically speaking, you must search out the individuals.
10073-8{_}1083{_}You must step aside from your way for the sake of a new acquaintance; in conversations, in sermons, in addresses, in letters, in journalistic columns, in standard literature you must grasp the stranger by the hand and look him straight in the eye.
10073-8{_}1084{_}Nor must you treat cavalierly the words you know already.
10073-8{_}1085{_}You must study them afresh; you must learn them over and learn them better; you must come to understand them, not only for what they are, but for what they will do.
10073-8{_}1086{_}<What Words to Learn First>  What, then, is your first task?
10073-8{_}1087{_}Somebody has laid down the injunction-- and, as always when anything is enjoined, others have given it currency-- that each day you should learn two new words.
10073-8{_}1088{_}So be it,--but which two?
10073-8{_}1089{_}The first two in the dictionary, or hitherto left untouched in your systematic conquest of the dictionary?
10073-8{_}1090{_}The first two you hear spoken?
10073-8{_}1091{_}The first two that stare at you from casual, everyday print?
10073-8{_}1092{_}The first two you can ferret from some technical jargon, some special department of human interest or endeavor?
10073-8{_}1093{_}In any of these ways you may obey the behest of these mentors.
10073-8{_}1094{_}But are not such ways arbitrary, haphazard?
10073-8{_}1095{_}And suppose, after doing your daily stint, you should encounter a word it behooves you to know.
10073-8{_}1096{_}What then?
10073-8{_}1097{_}Are you to sulk, to withhold yourself from further exertion on the plea of a vocabulary-builder's eight-hour day?
10073-8{_}1098{_}To adopt any of the methods designated would be like resolving to invest in city lots and then buying properties as you encountered them, with no regard for expenditure, for value in general, or for special serviceability to you.
10073-8{_}1099{_}Surely such procedure would be unbusinesslike.
10073-8{_}1100{_}If you pay out good money, you meditate well whether that which you receive for it shall compensate you.
10073-8{_}1101{_}Likewise if you devote time and effort to gaining ownership of words, you should exercise foresight in determining whether they will yield you commensurate returns.
10073-8{_}1102{_}What, then, is the principle upon which, at the outset, you should proceed?
10073-8{_}1103{_}What better than to insure the possession of the words regarding which you know this already, that you need them and should make them yours?
10073-8{_}1104{_}<The Analysis of Your Own Vocabulary>  The natural way, and the best, to begin is with an analysis of your own vocabulary.
10073-8{_}1105{_}You are of course aware that of the enormous number of words contained in the dictionary relatively few are at your beck and bidding.
10073-8{_}1106{_}But probably you have made no attempt to ascertain the nature and extent of your actual linguistic resources.
10073-8{_}1107{_}You should make an inventory of the stock on hand before sending in your order for additional goods.
10073-8{_}1108{_}You will speedily discover that your vocabulary embraces several distinct classes of words.
10073-8{_}1109{_}Of these the first consists of those words which you have at your tongue's end--which you can summon without effort and use in your daily speech.
10073-8{_}1110{_}They are old verbal friends.
10073-8{_}1111{_}Numbered with them, to be sure, there may be few with senses and connotations you are ignorant of-- friends of yours, let us say, with a reservation.
10073-8{_}1112{_}Even these you may woo with a little care into uncurbed fraternal abandon.
10073-8{_}1113{_}With the exception of these few, you know the words of the first class so well that without thinking about it at all you may rely upon their giving you, the moment you need them, their untempered, uttermost service.
10073-8{_}1114{_}You need be at no further pains about them.
10073-8{_}1115{_}They are yours already.
10073-8{_}1116{_}A second class of words is made up of those you speak on occasions either special or formal--occasions when you are trying, perhaps not to show off, but at least to put your best linguistic foot foremost.
10073-8{_}1117{_}Some of them have a meaning you are not quite sure of; some of them seem too ostentatious for workaday purposes; some of them you might have been using but somehow have not.
10073-8{_}1118{_}Words of this class are not your bosom friends.
10073-8{_}1119{_}They are your speaking acquaintance, or perhaps a little better than that.
10073-8{_}1120{_}You must convert them into friends, into prompt and staunch supporters in time of need.
10073-8{_}1121{_}That is to say, you must put them into class one.
10073-8{_}1122{_}In bringing about this change of footing, you yourself must make the advances.
10073-8{_}1123{_}You must say, Go to, I will bear them in mind as I would a person I wished to cultivate.
10073-8{_}1124{_}When occasion rises, you must introduce them into your talk.
10073-8{_}1125{_}You will feel a bit shy about it, for introductions are difficult to accomplish gracefully; you will steal a furtive glance at your hearer perchance, and another at the word itself, as you would when first labeling a man "my friend Mr.
10073-8{_}1126{_}Blank."
10073-8{_}1127{_}But the embarrassment is momentary, and there is no other way.
10073-8{_}1128{_}Assume a friendship if you have it not, and presently the friendship will be real.
10073-8{_}1129{_}You must be steadfast in intention; for the words that have held aloof from you are many, and to unloose all at once on a single victim would well-nigh brand you criminal.
10073-8{_}1130{_}But you will make sure headway, and will be conscious besides that no other class of words in the language will so well repay the mastering.
10073-8{_}1131{_}For these are words you _do_ use, and need to use more, and more freely--words your own experience stamps as valuable, if not indeed vital, to you.
10073-8{_}1132{_}The third class of words is made up of those you do not speak at all, but sometimes write.
10073-8{_}1133{_}They are acquaintance one degree farther removed than those of the second class.
10073-8{_}1134{_}Your task is to bring them into class two and thence into class one--that is, to introduce them into your more formal speech, and from this gradually into your everyday speech.
10073-8{_}1135{_}The fourth class of words is made up of those you recognize when you hear or read them, but yourself never employ.
10073-8{_}1136{_}They are acquaintance of a very distant kind.
10073-8{_}1137{_}You nod to them, let us say, and they to you; but there the intercourse ends.
10073-8{_}1138{_}Obviously, they are not to be brought without considerable effort into a position of tried and trusted friendship.
10073-8{_}1139{_}And shall we be absolutely honest?--some of them may not justify such assiduous care as their complete subjugation would call for.
10073-8{_}1140{_}But even these you should make your feudal retainers.
10073-8{_}1141{_}You should constrain them to membership in class three, and at your discretion in class two.
10073-8{_}1142{_}Apart from the words in class four, you will not to this point have made actual additions to your vocabulary.
10073-8{_}1143{_}But you will have made your vocabulary infinitely more serviceable.
10073-8{_}1144{_}You will be like a man with a host of friends where before, when his necessities were sorest, he found (along with some friends) many distant and timid acquaintance.
10073-8{_}1145{_}Outside the bounds of your present vocabulary altogether are the words you encounter but do not recognize, except (it may be) dimly and uncertainly.
10073-8{_}1146{_}Some counselors would have you look up all such words in a dictionary.
10073-8{_}1147{_}But the task would be irksome.
10073-8{_}1148{_}Moreover those who prescribe it are loath to perform it themselves.
10073-8{_}1149{_}Your own candid judgment in the matter is the safest guide.
10073-8{_}1150{_}If the word is incidental rather than vital to the meaning of the passage that contains it, and if it gives promise of but rarely crossing your vision again, you should deign it no more than a civil glance.
10073-8{_}1151{_}Plenty of ways will be left you to expend time wisely in the service of your vocabulary.
10073-8{_}1152{_}EXERCISE - Analysis  1.
10073-8{_}1153{_}Make a list of the words in class two of your own vocabulary, and similar lists for classes three and four.
10073-8{_}1154{_}(To make a list for class one would be but a waste of time.)
10073-8{_}1155{_}Procure if you can for this purpose a loose-leaf notebook, and in the several lists reserve a full page for each letter of the alphabet as used initially.
10073-8{_}1156{_}Do not scamp the lists, though their proper preparation consume many days, many weeks.
10073-8{_}1157{_}Try to make them really exhaustive.
10073-8{_}1158{_}Their value will be in proportion to their accuracy and fulness.
10073-8{_}1159{_}2.
10073-8{_}1160{_}Con the words in each list carefully and repeatedly.
10073-8{_}1161{_}Your task is to transfer these words into a more intimate list--those in class four into class three, those in three into two, those in two into one.
10073-8{_}1162{_}You are then to promote again the words in the lower classes, except that (if your judgment so dictates) you may leave the new class three wholly or partially intact.
10073-8{_}1163{_}To carry out this exercise properly you must keep these words in mind, make them part and parcel of your daily life.
10073-8{_}1164{_}(For a special device for bringing them under subjection, see the next exercise.)
10073-8{_}1165{_}3.
10073-8{_}1166{_}To write a word down helps you to remember it.
10073-8{_}1167{_}That is why the normal way to transfer a word from class four into class two is to put it temporarily into the intermediary class, three; you first _see_ or _hear_ the word, next _write_ it, afterwards _speak_ it.
10073-8{_}1168{_}The mere writing down of your lists has probably done much to bring the words written into the circuit of your memory, where you can more readily lay hold of them.
10073-8{_}1169{_}Also it has fortified your confidence in using them; for to write a word out, letter by letter, makes you surer that you have its right form.
10073-8{_}1170{_}With many of your words you will likely have no more trouble; they will be at hand, anxious for employment, and you may use them according to your need.
10073-8{_}1171{_}But some of your words will still stubbornly withhold themselves from memory.
10073-8{_}1172{_}Weed these out from your lists, make a special list of them, copy it frequently, construct short sentences into which the troublesome words fit.
10073-8{_}1173{_}By dint of writing the words so often you will soon make them more tractable.
10073-8{_}1174{_}4.
10073-8{_}1175{_}Make a fifth list of words--those you hear or see printed, do not understand the meaning of, but yet feel you should know.
10073-8{_}1176{_}Obtain and confirm a grasp of them by the successive processes used with words in the preceding lists.
10073-8{_}1177{_}<The Definition of Words>  Another means of buttressing your command of your present vocabulary is to define words you use or are familiar with.
10073-8{_}1178{_}Do not bewilder yourself with words (like _and, the_) which call for ingenuity in handling somewhat technical terms, or with words (like _thing, affair, condition_) which loosely cover a multitude of meanings.
10073-8{_}1179{_}(You may, however, concentrate your efforts upon some one meaning of words in the latter group.)
10073-8{_}1180{_}Select words with a fairly definite signification, and express this as precisely as you can.
10073-8{_}1181{_}You may afterwards consult a dictionary for means of checking up on what you have done.
10073-8{_}1182{_}But in consulting it think only of idea, not of form.
10073-8{_}1183{_}You are not training yourself in dictionary definitions, but in the sharpness and clarity of your understanding of meanings.
10073-8{_}1184{_}About the only rule to be laid down regarding the definition of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs is that you must not define a word in terms of itself.
10073-8{_}1185{_}Thus if you define _grudgingly_ as "in a grudging manner," you do not dissipate your hearer's uncertainty as to what the word means.
10073-8{_}1186{_}If you define it as "unwillingly" or "in a manner that shows reluctance to yield possession," you give your hearer a clear-cut idea in no wise dependent upon his ability to understand the word that puzzled him in the first place.
10073-8{_}1187{_}Normally, in defining a noun you should assign the thing named to a general class, and to its special limits within that class; in other words, you should designate its genus and species.
10073-8{_}1188{_}You must take care to differentiate the species from all others comprised within the genus.
10073-8{_}1189{_}You will, in most instances, first indicate the genus and then the species, but at your convenience you may indicate the species first.
10073-8{_}1190{_}Thus if you affirm, "A cigar is smoking-tobacco in the form of a roll of tobacco-leaves," you name the genus first and later the characteristics of the species.
10073-8{_}1191{_}You have given a satisfactory definition.
10073-8{_}1192{_}If on the other hand you affirm, "A cigar is a roll of tobacco-leaves meant for smoking," you first designate the species and then merely imply the genus.
10073-8{_}1193{_}Again you have given a satisfactory definition; for you have permitted no doubt that the genus is smoking-tobacco, and have prescribed such limits for the species as exclude tobacco intended for a pipe or a cigarette.
10073-8{_}1194{_}In defining nouns by the genus-and-species method, restrict the genus to the narrowest possible bounds.
10073-8{_}1195{_}You will thus save the need for exclusions later.
10073-8{_}1196{_}Had you in your first definition of a cigar begun by saying that it is tobacco, rather than smoking-tobacco, you would have violated this principle; and you would have had to amplify the rest of your definition in order to exclude chewing-tobacco, snuff, and the like.
10073-8{_}1197{_}EXERCISE - Definition  1.
10073-8{_}1198{_}Define words of your own choosing in accordance with the principles laid down in the preceding section of the text.
10073-8{_}1199{_}2.
10073-8{_}1200{_}Define the following adjectives, adverbs, and verbs:  Miserable      Rebuke       Wise Angrily        Rapidly      Boundless Swim           Paint        Whiten Haughtily      Surly        Causelessly  3.
10073-8{_}1201{_}So define the following nouns as to prevent any possible confusion with the nouns following them in parentheses:  Wages (salary)          Ride (drive) Planet (star)           Truck (automobile) Watch (clock)           Reins (lines) Jail (penitentiary)     Iron (steel) Vegetable (fruit)       Timber (lumber) Flower (weed)           Rope (string) Hail (sleet, snow)      Stock (bond) Newspaper (magazine)    Street car (railway coach) Cloud (fog)             Revolver (rifle, pistol, etc.)
10073-8{_}1202{_}Mountain (hill)         Creek (river) Letter (postal card)  4.
10073-8{_}1203{_}While remembering that the following words are of broad signification and mean different things to different people, define them according to their meaning to you:  Gentleman               Courage Honesty                 Beauty Honor                   Good manners Generosity              A good while Charity                 A little distance Modesty                 Long ago   <How to Look Up a Word in the Dictionary>  So much for the words which are already yours, or which you can make yours through your own unaided efforts.
10073-8{_}1204{_}For convenience we have grouped with them some words of a nature more baffling--words of which you know perhaps but a single aspect rather than the totality, or upon which you can obtain but a feeble and precarious grip.
10073-8{_}1205{_}These slightly known words belong more to the class now to be considered than to that just disposed of.
10073-8{_}1206{_}For we have now to deal with words over which you can establish no genuine rulership unless you have outside help.
10073-8{_}1207{_}You must own a dictionary, have it by you, consult it carefully and often.
10073-8{_}1208{_}Do not select one for purchasing upon the basis of either mere bigness or cheapness.
10073-8{_}1209{_}If you do, you may make yourself the owner of an out-of-date reprint from stereotyped plates.
10073-8{_}1210{_}What to choose depends partly upon personal preference, partly upon whether your need is for comprehensiveness or compression.
10073-8{_}1211{_}If you are a scholar, _Murray's_ many-volumed _New English Dictionary_ may be the publication for you; but if you are an ordinary person, you will probably content yourself with something less expensive and exhaustive.
10073-8{_}1212{_}You will find the _Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia_, in twelve volumes, or _Webster's New International Dictionary_ an admirable compilation.
10073-8{_}1213{_}The _New Standard Dictionary_ will also prove useful.
10073-8{_}1214{_}All in all, if you can afford it, you should provide yourself with one or the other of these three large and authoritative, but not too inclusive, works.
10073-8{_}1215{_}Of the smaller lexicons _Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Webster's Secondary School Dictionary_, the _Practical Standard Dictionary_, and the _Desk Standard Dictionary_ answer most purposes well.
10073-8{_}1216{_}A dictionary is not for show.
10073-8{_}1217{_}You must learn to use it.
10073-8{_}1218{_}What ordinarily passes for use is in fact abuse.
10073-8{_}1219{_}Wherein?
10073-8{_}1220{_}Let us say that you turn to your lexicon for the meaning of a word.
10073-8{_}1221{_}Of the various definitions given, you disregard all save the one which enables the word to make sense in its present context, or which fits your preconception of what the word should stand for.
10073-8{_}1222{_}Having engaged in this solemn mummery, you mentally record the fact that you have been squandering your time, and enter into a compact with yourself that no more will you so do.
10073-8{_}1223{_}At best you have tided over a transitory need, or have verified a surmise.
10073-8{_}1224{_}You have not truly _learned_ the word, brought it into a vassal's relationship with you, so fixed it in memory that henceforth, night or day, you can take it up like a familiar tool.
10073-8{_}1225{_}This procedure is blundering, farcical, futile, incorrect.
10073-8{_}1226{_}To suppose you have learned a word by so cursory a glance at its resources is like supposing you have learned a man through having had him render you some temporary and trivial service, as lending you a match or telling you the time of day.
10073-8{_}1227{_}To acquaint yourself thoroughly with a word--or a man-- involves effort, application.
10073-8{_}1228{_}You must go about the work seriously, intelligently.
10073-8{_}1229{_}One secret of consulting a dictionary properly lies in finding the primary, the original meaning of the word.
10073-8{_}1230{_}You must go to the source.
10073-8{_}1231{_}If the word is of recent formation, and is native rather than naturalized English, you have only to look through the definitions given.
10073-8{_}1232{_}Such a word will not cause you much trouble.
10073-8{_}1233{_}But if the word is derived from primitive English or from a foreign language, you must seek its origin, not in one of the numbered subheads of the definition, but in an etymological record you will perceive within brackets or parentheses.
10073-8{_}1234{_}Here you will find the Anglo-Saxon (Old English), Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian, or other word from which sprang the word you are studying, and along with this authentic original you may find cognate words in other languages.
10073-8{_}1235{_}These you may examine if you care to observe their resemblance to your word, but the examination is not necessary.
10073-8{_}1236{_}It could teach you only the earlier or other _forms_ of your word, whereas what you are after is the original _meaning_.
10073-8{_}1237{_}This too is set down within the brackets; if your search is in earnest, you cannot possible miss it.
10073-8{_}1238{_}And having discovered this original meaning, you must get it in mind; it is one of the really significant things about the word.
10073-8{_}1239{_}Your next step is to find the present import of the word.
10073-8{_}1240{_}Look, therefore, through the modern definitions.
10073-8{_}1241{_}Of these there may be too many, with too delicate shadings in thought between them, for you to keep all clearly in mind.
10073-8{_}1242{_}In fact you need not try.
10073-8{_}1243{_}Consider them of course, but out of them seek mainly the drift, the central meaning.
10073-8{_}1244{_}After a little practice you will be able to disengage it from the others.
10073-8{_}1245{_}You now know the original sense of the word and its central signification today.
10073-8{_}1246{_}The two may be identical; they may be widely different; but through reflection or study of the entire definition you will establish some sort of connection between them.
10073-8{_}1247{_}When you have done this, you have mastered the word.
10073-8{_}1248{_}From the two meanings you can surmise the others, wherever and whenever encountered; for the others are but outgrowths and applications of them.
10073-8{_}1249{_}One warning will not be amiss.
10073-8{_}1250{_}You must not suppose that the terms used in defining a word are its absolute synonyms, or may be substituted for it indiscriminately.
10073-8{_}1251{_}You must develop a feeling for _the limits_ of the word, so that you may perceive where its likeness to the other terms leaves off and its unlikeness begins.
10073-8{_}1252{_}Thus if one of the terms employed in defining _command_ is _control_, you must not assume that the two words are interchangeable; you must not say, for instance, that the captain controlled his men to present arms.
10073-8{_}1253{_}Such, abstractly stated, is the way to look up a word in the dictionary.
10073-8{_}1254{_}Let us now take a concrete illustration.
10073-8{_}1255{_}Starting with the word _tension_, let us ascertain what we can about it in the _Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia_.
10073-8{_}1256{_}Our first quest is the original meaning.
10073-8{_}1257{_}For this we consult the bracketed matter.
10073-8{_}1258{_}There we meet the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian kinsmen of the word, and learn that they are traceable to a common ancestor, the Latin _tensio(n)_, which comes from the Latin verb _tendere_.
10073-8{_}1259{_}The meaning of _tensio(n)_ is given as "stretching," that of _tendere_ as "stretch," "extend."
10073-8{_}1260{_}Thus we know of the original word that in form it closely resembles the modern word, and that in meaning it involves the idea of stretching.
10073-8{_}1261{_}What is the central meaning of the word today?
10073-8{_}1262{_}To acquaint ourselves with this we must run through the definitions listed.
10073-8{_}1263{_}Here (in condensed form) they are.
10073-8{_}1264{_}(1) The act of stretching.
10073-8{_}1265{_}(2) In _mechanics_, stress or the force by which something is pulled.
10073-8{_}1266{_}(3) In _physics_, a constrained condition of the particles of bodies.
10073-8{_}1267{_}(4) In _statical electricity_, surface-density.
10073-8{_}1268{_}(5) Mental strain, stress, or application.
10073-8{_}1269{_}(6) A strained state of any kind, as political or social.
10073-8{_}1270{_}(7) An attachment to a sewing-machine for regulating the strain of the thread.
10073-8{_}1271{_}Now of these definitions (2), (3), (4), and (7) are too highly specialized to conduct us, of themselves, into the highway of the word's meaning.
10073-8{_}1272{_}They bear out, however, the evidence of (1), (5), and (6), which have as their core the idea of stretching, or of the strain which stretching produces.
10073-8{_}1273{_}We must now lay the original meaning alongside the central meaning today, in order to draw our conclusions.
10073-8{_}1274{_}We perceive that the two meanings correspond.
10073-8{_}1275{_}Yet by prying into them we make out one marked difference between them.
10073-8{_}1276{_}The original meaning is literal, the modern largely figurative.
10073-8{_}1277{_}To be sure, the figure has been so long used that it is now scarcely felt as a figure; its force and definiteness have departed.
10073-8{_}1278{_}Consequently we may speak of being on a tension without having in mind at all a comparison of our nervous system with a stretched garment, or with an outreaching arm, or with a tightly strung musical instrument, or with a taut rope.
10073-8{_}1279{_}What, then, is the net result of our investigation?
10073-8{_}1280{_}Simply this, that _tension_ means stretching, and that the stretching may be conceived either literally or figuratively.
10073-8{_}1281{_}With these two facts in mind, we need not (unless we are experts in mechanics, physics, statical electricity, or the sewing-machine) go to the trouble of committing the special senses of _tension_; for should occasion bid, we can--from our position at the heart of the word--easily grasp their rough purport.
10073-8{_}1282{_}And from other persons than specialists no more would be required.
10073-8{_}1283{_}EXERCISE - Dictionary  For each of the following words find (a) the original meaning, (b) the central meaning today.
10073-8{_}1284{_}(Other words are given in the exercises at the end of this chapter.)
10073-8{_}1285{_}Bias          Supersede     Sly Aversion      Capital       Meerschaum Extravagant   Travel        Alley Concur        Travail       Fee Attention     Apprehend     Superb Magnanimity   Lewd          Adroit Altruism      Instigation   Quite Benevolence   Complexion    Urchin Charity       Bishop        Thoroughfare Unction       Starve        Naughty Speed         Cunning       Moral Success       Decent        Antic Crafty        Handsome      Savage Usury         Solemn        Uncouth Costume       Parlor        Window Presumption   Bombastic     Colleague Petty         Vixen         Alderman Queen         Doctor        Engage   <Prying Into a Word's Past>  To thread with minute fidelity the mazes of a word's former history is the task of the linguistic scholar; our province is the practical and the present-day.
10073-8{_}1286{_}But words, like men, are largely what they are because of what they have been; and to turn a gossip's eye upon their past is to procure for ourselves, often, not only enlightenment but also entertainment.
10073-8{_}1287{_}This fact, though brought out in some part already, deserves separate and fuller discussion.
10073-8{_}1288{_}In the first place, curiosity as to words' past experience enables us to read with keener understanding the literature of preceding ages.
10073-8{_}1289{_}Of course we should not, even so, go farther back than about three centuries.
10073-8{_}1290{_}To read anything earlier than Shakespeare would require us to delve too deeply into linguistic bygones.
10073-8{_}1291{_}And to read Shakespeare himself requires effort--but rewards it.
10073-8{_}1292{_}Let us see how an insight into words will help us to interpret the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4).
10073-8{_}1293{_}In line 2 of this passage appears the word _merely_.
10073-8{_}1294{_}In Shakespeare's time it frequently meant "altogether" or "that and nothing else."
10073-8{_}1295{_}As here used, it may be taken to mean this, or to have its modern meaning, or to stand in meaning midway between the two and to be suggestive of both; there is no way of determining precisely.
10073-8{_}1296{_}In line 12 the word _pard_ means leopard.
10073-8{_}1297{_}In line 18 _saws_ means "sayings" (compare the phrase "an old saw"); _modern_ means "moderate," "commonplace"; _instances_ means what we mean by it today, "examples," "illustrations."
10073-8{_}1298{_}(Line 18 as a whole gives us a vivid sense of the justice's readiness to speak sapiently, after the manner of justices, and to trot out his trite illustrations on the slightest provocation.)
10073-8{_}1299{_}The word _pantaloon_ in line 20 is interesting.
10073-8{_}1300{_}The patron saint of Venice was St. Pantaleon (the term is from Greek, means "all-lion," and possibly refers to the lion of St. Mark's Cathedral).
10073-8{_}1301{_}_Pantaloon_ came therefore to signify (1) a Venetian, (2) a garment worn by Venetians and consisting of breeches and stockings in one.
10073-8{_}1302{_}The second sense is preserved, substantially, in our term _pantaloons_.
10073-8{_}1303{_}The first sense led to the use of the word (in the mouths of the Venetians' enemies) for "buffoon" and then (in early Italian comedy) for "a lean and foolish old man."
10073-8{_}1304{_}It is this stock figure of the stage that Shakespeare evokes.
10073-8{_}1305{_}In line 22 _hose_ means the covering for a man's body from his waist to his nether-stock.
10073-8{_}1306{_}(Compare the present meaning: a covering for the feet and the _lower_ part of the legs.)
10073-8{_}1307{_}In line 27 _mere_ means "absolute."
10073-8{_}1308{_}In line 28 _sans_ means "without."
10073-8{_}1309{_}Of the words we have examined, only _sans_ is obsolete, though _pard_, _saws_, and _pantaloon_ are perhaps not entirely familiar.
10073-8{_}1310{_}That is, only one word in the passage, so far as its outward form goes, is completely alien to our knowledge.
10073-8{_}1311{_}But how different the matter stands when we consider meanings!
10073-8{_}1312{_}The words are words of today, but the meanings are the meanings of Shakespeare.
10073-8{_}1313{_}We should be baffled and misled as to the dramatist's thought if we had made no inquiries into the vehicle therefor.
10073-8{_}1314{_}In the second place, to look beyond the present into the more remote signification of words will put us on our guard against the reappearance of submerged or half-forgotten meanings.
10073-8{_}1315{_}We have seen that the word _tension_ may be used without conscious connection with the idea of stretching.
10073-8{_}1316{_}But if we incautiously place the word in the wrong environment, the idea will be resurrected to our undoing.
10073-8{_}1317{_}We associate _ardor_ with strong and eager desire.
10073-8{_}1318{_}For ordinary purposes this conception of the word suffices.
10073-8{_}1319{_}But _ardor_ is one of the children of fire; its primary sense is "burning" (compare _arson_).
10073-8{_}1320{_}Therefore to pronounce the three vocables "overflowing with ardor" is to mix figures of speech absurdly.
10073-8{_}1321{_}We should fall into a similar mistake if we said "brilliant fluency," and into a mistake of another kind (that of tautology or repetition of an idea) if we said "heart-felt cordiality," for _cordiality_ means "feelings of the heart."
10073-8{_}1322{_}_Appreciate_ means "set a (due) value on."
10073-8{_}1323{_}We may perhaps say "really appreciate," but scrupulous writers and speakers do not say "appreciate very much."
10073-8{_}1324{_}A _humor_ (compare humid) was once a "moisture"; then one of the four moistures or liquids that entered into the human constitution and by the proportions of their admixture determined human temperament; next a man's outstanding temperamental quality (the thing itself rather than the cause of it); then oddity which people may laugh at; then the spirit of laughter and good nature in general.
10073-8{_}1325{_}Normally we do not connect the idea of moisture with the word.
10073-8{_}1326{_}We may even speak of "a dry humor."
10073-8{_}1327{_}But we should not say "now and then a dry humor crops out," for then too many buried meanings lie in the same grave for the very dead to rest peacefully together.
10073-8{_}1328{_}Even apart from reading old literature and from having, when you use words, no ghosts of their pristine selves rise up to damn you, you may profit from a knowledge of how the meaning of a term has evolved.
10073-8{_}1329{_}For example, you will meet many tokens and reminders of the customs and beliefs of our ancestors.
10073-8{_}1330{_}Thus _coxcomb_ carries you back to the days when every court was amused by a "fool" whose head was decked with a cock's comb; _crestfallen_ takes you back to cockfighting; and _lunatic_ ("moonstruck"), _disaster_ ("evil star"), and "thank your lucky stars" plant you in the era of superstition when human fate was governed by heavenly bodies.
10073-8{_}1331{_}Further, you will perceive the poetry of words.
10073-8{_}1332{_}Thus to _wheedle is_ to wag the tail and to _patter_ is to hurry through one's prayers (paternoster).
10073-8{_}1333{_}What a picture of the frailty of men even in their holiness flashes on us from that word _patter!
10073-8{_}1334{_}Breakfast is_ the breaking of the fast of the night.
10073-8{_}1335{_}_Routine_ (the most humdrum of words) is travel along a way already broken.
10073-8{_}1336{_}_Goodby _is an abridged form of "God be with you."
10073-8{_}1337{_}_Dilapidated_ is fallen stone from stone.
10073-8{_}1338{_}_Daisy_ is "the day's eye," _nasturtium_ (from its spicy smell) "the nose-twister," _dandelion_ "the tooth of the lion."
10073-8{_}1339{_}_A lord_ is a bread-guard.
10073-8{_}1340{_}You will perceive, moreover, that many a dignified word once involved the same idea as some unassuming or even semi-disreputable word or expression involves now.
10073-8{_}1341{_}Thus there is little or no difference in figure between understanding a thing and getting on to it; between averting something (turning it aside) and sidetracking it; between excluding (shutting out) and closing the door to; between degrading (putting down a step) and taking down a notch; between accumulating (heaping up) and making one's pile; between taking umbrage (the shadow) and being thrown in the shade; between ejaculating and throwing out a remark; between being on a tension and being highstrung; between being vapid and having lost steam; between insinuating (winding in) and worming in; between investigating and tracking; between instigating (goading on or into) and prodding up; between being incensed (compare _incendiary_) and burning with indignation; between recanting (unsinging) and singing another tune; between ruminating (chewing) and smoking in one's pipe.
10073-8{_}1342{_}Nor is there much difference in figure between sarcasm (a tearing of the flesh) and taking the hide off; between sinister (left-handed) and backhanded; between preposterous (rear end foremost) and cart before the horse; between salary (salt-money, an allowance for soldiers) and pin-money; between pedigree (crane's foot, from the appearance of genealogical diagrams) and crowsfeet (about the eyes); between either precocious (early cooked), apricot (early cooked), crude (raw), or recrudescence (raw again) and half-baked.
10073-8{_}1343{_}To ponder is literally to weigh; to apprehend an idea is to take hold of it; to deviate is to go out of one's way; to congregate is to flock together; to assail or insult a man is to jump on him; to be precipitate is to go head foremost; to be recalcitrant is to kick.
10073-8{_}1344{_}Again, you will perceive that many words once had more literal or more definitely concrete meanings than they have now.
10073-8{_}1345{_}To corrode is to gnaw along with others, to differ is to carry apart, to refuse is to pour back.
10073-8{_}1346{_}Polite is polished, absurd is very deaf, egregious is taken from the common herd, capricious is leaping about like a goat, cross (disagreeable) is shaped like a cross, wrong is wrung (or twisted).
10073-8{_}1347{_}Crisscross is Christ's cross, attention is stretching toward, expression is pressed out, dexterity is right-handedness, circumstances are things standing around, an innuendo is nodding, a parlor is a room to talk in, a nostril is that which pierces the nose (thrill means pierce), vinegar is sharp wine, a stirrup is a rope to mount by, a pastor is a shepherd, a marshal is a caretaker of horses, a constable is a stable attendant, a companion is a sharer of one's bread.
10073-8{_}1348{_}On the other hand, you will find that many words were once more general in import than they have since become.
10073-8{_}1349{_}_Fond_ originally meant foolish, then foolishly devoted, then (becoming more general again) devoted.
10073-8{_}1350{_}_Nostrum_ meant our own, then a medicine not known by other physicians, then a quack remedy.
10073-8{_}1351{_}_Shamefast_ meant confirmed in modesty (shame); then through a confusion of _fast_ with _faced_, a betrayal through the countenance of self-consciousness or guilt.
10073-8{_}1352{_}_Counterfeit_ meant a copy or a picture, then an unlawful duplication, especially of a coin.
10073-8{_}1353{_}_Lust_ meant pleasure of any sort, then inordinate sexual pleasure or desire.
10073-8{_}1354{_}_Virtue_ (to trace only a few of its varied activities) meant manliness, then the quality or attribute peculiar to true manhood (with the Romans this was valor), then any admirable quality, then female chastity.
10073-8{_}1355{_}_Pen_ meant a feather, then a quill to write with, then an instrument for writing used in the same way as a quill.
10073-8{_}1356{_}A _groom_ meant a man, then a stableman (in _bridegroom_, however, it preserves the old signification).
10073-8{_}1357{_}_Heathen_ (heath-dweller), _pagan_ (peasant), and _demon_ (a divinity) had in themselves no iniquitous savor until early Christians formed their opinion of the people inaccessible to them and the spirits incompatible with the unity of the Godhead.
10073-8{_}1358{_}Words betokening future happenings or involving judgment tend to take a special cast from the fears and anxieties men feel when their fortune is affected or their destiny controlled by external forces.
10073-8{_}1359{_}Thus _omen_ (a prophetic utterance or sign) and _portent_ (a stretching forward, a foreseeing, a foretelling) might originally be either benign or baleful; but nowadays, especially in the adjectival forms _ominous_ and _portentous_, they wear a menacing hue.
10073-8{_}1360{_}Similarly _criticism_, _censure_, and _doom_, all of them signifying at first mere judgment, have come--the first in popular, the other two in universal, usage--to stand for adverse judgment.
10073-8{_}1361{_}The old sense of _doom_ is perpetuated, however, in _Doomsday_, which means the day on which we are all to be, not necessarily sent to hell, but judged.
10073-8{_}1362{_}You will furthermore perceive that the exaggerated affirmations people are always indulging in have led to the weakening of many a word.
10073-8{_}1363{_}_Fret_ meant eat; formerly to say that a man was fretting was to use a vigorous comparison--to have the man devoured with care.
10073-8{_}1364{_}_Mortify_ meant to kill, then killed with embarrassment, then embarrassed.
10073-8{_}1365{_}_Qualm_ meant death, but our qualms of conscience have degenerated into mere twinges.
10073-8{_}1366{_}Oaths are shorn of their might by overuse; _confound_, once a tremendous malinvocation, may now fall from the lips of respectable young ladies, and _fie_, in its time not a whit less dire, would be scarcely out of place in even a cloister.
10073-8{_}1367{_}Words designating immediacy come to have no more strength than soup-meat seven times boiled.
10073-8{_}1368{_}_Presently_ meant in the present, _soon_ and _by and by_ meant forthwith.
10073-8{_}1369{_}How they have lost their fundamental meaning will be intelligible to you if you have in ordering something been told that it would be delivered "right away," or in calling for a girl have been told that she would be down "in a minute."
10073-8{_}1370{_}You will detect in words of another class a deterioration, not in force, but in character; they have fallen into contemptuous or sinister usage.
10073-8{_}1371{_}Many words for skill or wisdom have been thus debased.
10073-8{_}1372{_}_Cunning_ meant knowing, _artful_ meant well acquainted with one's art, _crafty_ meant proficient in one's craft or calling, _wizard_ meant wise man.
10073-8{_}1373{_}The present import of these words shows how men have assumed that mental superiority must be yoked with moral dereliction or diabolical aid.
10073-8{_}1374{_}Words indicating the generality--indicating ordinary rank or popular affiliations--have in many instances suffered the same decline.
10073-8{_}1375{_}_Trivial_ meant three ways; it was what might be heard at the crossroads or on any route you chanced to be traveling, and its value was accordingly slight.
10073-8{_}1376{_}_Lewd_ meant belonging to the laity; it came to mean ignorant, and then morally reprehensible.
10073-8{_}1377{_}_Common_ may be used to signify ill-bred; _vulgar_ may be and frequently is used to signify indecent.
10073-8{_}1378{_}_Sabotage_, from a French term meaning wooden shoe, has come to be applied to the deliberate and systematic scamping of one's work in order to injure one's employer.
10073-8{_}1379{_}_Idiot_ (common soldier) crystallizes the exasperated ill opinion of officers for privates.
10073-8{_}1380{_}(_Infantry_--an organization of military infants--has on the contrary sloughed its reproach and now enshrines the dignity of lowliness.)
10073-8{_}1381{_}Somewhat akin to words of this type is _knave_, which first meant boy, then servant, then rogue.
10073-8{_}1382{_}Terms for agricultural classes seldom remain flattering.
10073-8{_}1383{_}Besides such epithets as _hayseed_ and _clodhopper_, contemptuous in their very origin, _villain_ (farm servant), _churl_ (farm laborer), and _boor_ (peasant) have all gathered unto themselves opprobrium; _villain_ now involves a scoundrelly spirit, _churl_ a contumelious manner, _boor_ a bumptious ill-breeding; not one of these words is any longer confined in its application to a particular social rank.
10073-8{_}1384{_}Terms for womankind are soon tainted.
10073-8{_}1385{_}_Wench_ meant at first nothing worse than girl or daughter, _quean_ than woman, _hussy_ than housewife; even _woman is_ generally felt to be half-slighting.
10073-8{_}1386{_}Terms affirming unacquaintance with sin, or abstention from it, tend to be quickly reft of what praise they are fraught with; none of us likes to be saluted as _innocent, guileless_, or _unsophisticated_, and to be dubbed _silly_ no longer makes us feel blessed.
10073-8{_}1387{_}Besides these and similar classes of words, there are innumerable individual terms that have sadly lost caste.
10073-8{_}1388{_}An _imp_ was erstwhile a scion; it then became a boy, and then a mischievous spirit.
10073-8{_}1389{_}A _noise_ might once be music; it has ceased to enjoy such possibilities.
10073-8{_}1390{_}To live near a piano that is constantly banged is to know how _noise_ as a synonym for music was outlawed.
10073-8{_}1391{_}A backward glance over the history of words repays you in showing you the words for what they are, and in having them live out their lives before you.
10073-8{_}1392{_}Do you know what an _umpire_ is?
10073-8{_}1393{_}He is a non (or num) peer, a not equal man, an odd man--one therefore who can decide disputes.
10073-8{_}1394{_}Do you know what a _nickname_ is?
10073-8{_}1395{_}It is an eke (also) name, a title bestowed upon one in addition to his proper designation.
10073-8{_}1396{_}Do you know what a _fellow_, etymologically speaking, is?
10073-8{_}1397{_}He is a fee-layer, a partner, a man who lays his fee (property) alongside yours.
10073-8{_}1398{_}Do you know that _matinée_, though awarded to the afternoon, meant primarily a morning entertainment and has traveled so far from its original sense that we call an actual before-noon performance a morning matinée?
10073-8{_}1399{_}Do you know the past of such words as _bedlam_, _rival_, _parson_, _sandwich_, _pocket handkerchief?_ _Bedlam_, a corruption of _Bethlehem_, was a hospital for the insane in London; it came to be a general term for great confusion or discord.
10073-8{_}1400{_}_Rivals_ were formerly dwellers--that is, neighboring dwellers--on the bank of a stream; disputes over water-rights gave the word its present meaning.
10073-8{_}1401{_}A _person_ or _parson_, for the two were the same, was a mask (literally, that through which the sound came); then an actor representing a character in a play; then a representative of any sort; then the representative of the church in a parish.
10073-8{_}1402{_}A _sandwich_ was a stratification of bread and meat by the Earl of Sandwich, who was so loath to leave the gaming table that he saved time by having food brought him in this form.
10073-8{_}1403{_}A _kerchief_ was originally a cover for the head, and indeed sundry amiable, old-fashioned grandmothers still use it for this purpose.
10073-8{_}1404{_}Afterward people carried it in their hands and called it a _handkerchief_; and when they transferred it to the pocket, they called it a _pocket handkerchief_ or pocket hand head-cover.
10073-8{_}1405{_}A scrutiny of such words should convince you that the reading of the dictionary, instead of being the dull occupation it is almost proverbially reputed to be, may become an occupation truly fascinating.
10073-8{_}1406{_}For clustered about the words recorded in the dictionary are inexhaustible riches of knowledge and of interest for those who have eyes to see.

10073-8{_}1456{_}V.      INDIVIDUAL WORDS: AS MEMBERS OF VERBAL FAMILIES   Our investigation into the nature, qualities, and fortunes of single words must now merge into a study of their family connections.
10073-8{_}1457{_}We do not go far into this new phase of our researches before we perceive that the career of a word may be very complicated.
10073-8{_}1458{_}Most people, if you asked them, would tell you that an individual word is a causeless entity--a thing that was never begotten and lacks power to propagate.
10073-8{_}1459{_}They would deny the possibility that its course through the world could be other than colorless, humdrum.
10073-8{_}1460{_}Now words thus immaculately conceived and fatefully impotent, words that shamble thus listlessly through life, there are.
10073-8{_}1461{_}But many words are born in an entirely normal way; have a grubby boyhood, a vigorous youth, and a sober maturity; marry, beget sons and daughters, become old, enfeebled, even senile; and suffer neglect, if not death.
10073-8{_}1462{_}In their advanced age they are exempted by the discerning from enterprises that call for a lusty agility, but are drafted into service by those to whom all levies are alike.
10073-8{_}1463{_}Indeed in their very prime of manhood their vicissitudes are such as to make them seem human.
10073-8{_}1464{_}Some rise in the world some sink; some start along the road of grandeur or obliquity, and then backslide or reform.
10073-8{_}1465{_}Some are social climbers, and mingle in company where verbal dress coats are worn; some are social degenerates, and consort with the ragamuffins and guttersnipes of language.
10073-8{_}1466{_}Some marry at their own social level, some above them, some beneath; some go down in childless bachelorhood or leave an unkempt and illegitimate progeny.
10073-8{_}1467{_}And if you trace their own lineage, you will find for some that it is but decent and middle-class, for some that it is mongrelized and miscegenetic, for some that it is proud, ancient, yea perhaps patriarchal.
10073-8{_}1468{_}It is contrary to nature for a word, as for a man, to live the life of a hermit.
10073-8{_}1469{_}Through external compulsion or internal characteristics a word has contacts with its fellows.
10073-8{_}1470{_}And its most intimate, most spontaneous associations are normally with its own kindred.
10073-8{_}1471{_}In our work hitherto we have had nothing to say of verbal consanguinity.
10073-8{_}1472{_}But we have not wholly ignored its existence, for the very good reason that we could not.
10073-8{_}1473{_}For example, in the latter portions of Chapter IV we proceeded on the hypothesis that at least some words have ancestors.
10073-8{_}1474{_}Also in the analysis of the dictionary definition of _tension_ we learned that the word has, not only a Latin forebear, but French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian kinsmen as well.
10073-8{_}1475{_}One thing omitted from that analysis would have revealed something further--namely, that the word has its English kinfolks too.
10073-8{_}1476{_}For the bracketed part of the dictionary definition mentions two other English words, _tend_ and _tense_, which from their origin involve the same idea as that of _tension_-- the idea of stretching.
10073-8{_}1477{_}Now words may be akin in either of two ways.
10073-8{_}1478{_}They may be related in blood.
10073-8{_}1479{_}Or they may be related by marriage.
10073-8{_}1480{_}Let us consider these two kinds of connection more fully.
10073-8{_}1481{_}<Words Related in Blood>  As an illustration of blood kinships enjoyed by a native English word take the adjective _good_.
10073-8{_}1482{_}We can easily call to mind other members of its family: goodly, goodish, goody-goody, good-hearted, good-natured, good- humored, good-tempered, goods, goodness, goodliness, gospel (good story), goodby, goodwill, goodman, goodwife, good-for-nothing, good den (good evening), the Good Book.
10073-8{_}1483{_}The connection between these words is obvious.
10073-8{_}1484{_}Next consider a group of words that have been naturalized: scribe, prescribe, ascribe, proscribe, transcribe, circumscribe, subscriber, indescribable, scribble, script, scripture, postscript, conscript, rescript, manuscript, nondescript, inscription, superscription, description.
10073-8{_}1485{_}It is clear that these words are each other's kith and kin in blood, and that the strain or stock common to all is _scribe_ or (as sometimes modified) _script_.
10073-8{_}1486{_}What does this strain signify?
10073-8{_}1487{_}The idea of writing.
10073-8{_}1488{_}The _scribes_ are a writing clan.
10073-8{_}1489{_}Some of them, to be sure, have strayed somewhat from the ancestral calling, for words are as wilful--or as independent--as men.
10073-8{_}1490{_}_Ascribe_, for example, does not act like a member of the household of writers, whatever it may look like.
10073-8{_}1491{_}We should have to scrutinize it carefully or consult the record for it in that verbal Who's Who, the dictionary, before we could understand how it came by its scribal affiliations honestly.
10073-8{_}1492{_}But once we begin to reflect or to probe, we find we have not mistaken its identity.
10073-8{_}1493{_}_Ascribe_ is the offspring of _ad_ (to) and _scribo_ (write), both Latin terms.
10073-8{_}1494{_}It originally meant writing to a person's name or after it (that is, imputing to the person by means of written words) some quality or happening of which he was regarded as the embodiment, source, or cause.
10073-8{_}1495{_}Nowadays we may saddle the matter on him through oral rather than written speech.
10073-8{_}1496{_}That is, _ascribe_ has largely lost the writing traits.
10073-8{_}1497{_}But all the same it is manifestly of the writing blood.
10073-8{_}1498{_}The _scribes_ are of undivided racial stock, Latin.
10073-8{_}1499{_}Consider now the _manu_, or _man_, words which sprang from the Latin _manus_, meaning "hand."
10073-8{_}1500{_}Here are some of them: manual, manoeuver, mandate, manacle, manicure, manciple, emancipate, manage, manner, manipulate, manufacture, manumission, manuscript, amanuensis.
10073-8{_}1501{_}These too are children of the same father; they are brothers and sisters to each other.
10073-8{_}1502{_}But what shall we say of legerdemain (light, or sleight, of hand), maintain, coup de main, and the like?
10073-8{_}1503{_}They bear a resemblance to the _man's_ and _manu's_, yet one that casual observers would not notice.
10073-8{_}1504{_}Is there kinship between the two sets of words?
10073-8{_}1505{_}There is.
10073-8{_}1506{_}But not the full fraternal or sororal relation.
10073-8{_}1507{_}The _mains_ are children of _manus_ by a French marriage he contracted.
10073-8{_}1508{_}With this French blood in their veins, they are only half-brothers, half-sisters of the _manu's_ and the _man's_.
10073-8{_}1509{_}Your examination of the family trees of words will be practical, rather than highly scholastic, in nature.
10073-8{_}1510{_}You need not track every word in the dictionary to the den of its remote parentage.
10073-8{_}1511{_}Nor need you bother your head with the name of the distant ancestor.
10073-8{_}1512{_}But in the case of the large number of words that have a numerous kindred you should learn to detect the inherited strain.
10073-8{_}1513{_}You will then know that the word is the brother or cousin of certain other words of your acquaintance, and this knowledge will apprise you of qualities in it with which you should reckon.
10073-8{_}1514{_}To this extent only must you make yourself a student of verbal genealogy.
10073-8{_}1515{_}EXERCISE - Blood  (Simple exercises in tracing blood relationships among words are given at the end of the chapter.
10073-8{_}1516{_}Therefore the exercises assigned here are of a special character.)
10073-8{_}1517{_}1.
10073-8{_}1518{_}Each of the following groups is made up of related words, but the relationship is somewhat disguised.
10073-8{_}1519{_}Consult the dictionary for each word, and learn all you can as to (a) its source, (b) the influence (as passing through an intermediate language) that gave it its present form, (c) the course of its development into its present meaning.

10073-8{_}1521{_}The variety of sources for modern English is indicated by the following list.
10073-8{_}1522{_}Do not seek for blood kinsmen of these particular words, but think of all the additional words you can that have come into English from Indian, Spanish, French, any other language spoken today.
10073-8{_}1523{_}Alphabet (Greek)              Piano (Italian) Folio (Latin)                 Car (Norman) Boudoir (French)              Rush (German) Binnacle (Portuguese)         Sky (Icelandic) Anger (Old Norse)             Yacht (Dutch) Isinglass (Low German)        Hussar (Hungarian) Slogan (Celtic)               Samovar (Russian) Polka (Polish)                Chess (Persian) Shekel (Hebrew)               Tea (Chinese) Algebra (Arabic)              Kimono (Japanese) Puttee (Hindoo)               Tattoo (Tahitian) Boomerang (Australian)        Voodoo (African) Potato (Haytian)              Skunk (American Indian) Guano (Peruvian)              Buncombe (American) Renegade (Spanish)   <Words Related by Marriage>  That words marry and are given in marriage, is too generally overlooked.
10073-8{_}1524{_}Any student of a foreign language, German for instance, can recall the thrill of discovery and the lift of reawakened hope that came to him when first he suspected, aye perceived, the existence of verbal matrimony.
10073-8{_}1525{_}For weeks he had struggled with words that apparently were made up of fortuitous collocations of letters.
10073-8{_}1526{_}Then in some beatific moment these huddles of letters took meaning; in instance after instance they represented, not a word, but words--a linguistic household.
10073-8{_}1527{_}Let them be what they might--a harem, the domestic establishment of a Mormon, the dwelling-place of verbal polygamists,--he could at last see order in their relationships.
10073-8{_}1528{_}To their morals he was indifferent, absorbed as he was in his joy of understanding.
10073-8{_}1529{_}In English likewise are thousands of these verbal marriages.
10073-8{_}1530{_}We may not be aware of them; from our very familiarity with words we may overlook the fact that in instances uncounted their oneness has been welded by a linguistic minister or justice of the peace.
10073-8{_}1531{_}But to read a single page or harken for thirty seconds to oral discourse with our minds intent on such states of wedlock is to convince ourselves that they abound.
10073-8{_}1532{_}Consider this list of everyday words: somebody, already, disease, vineyard, unskilled, outlet, nevertheless, holiday, insane, resell, schoolboy, helpmate, uphold, withstand, rainfall, deadlock, typewrite, football, motorman, thoroughfare, snowflake, buttercup, landlord, overturn.
10073-8{_}1533{_}Every term except one yokes a verbal husband with his wife, and the one exception (_nevertheless_) joins a uxorious man with two wives.
10073-8{_}1534{_}These marriages are of a simple kind.
10073-8{_}1535{_}But the nuptial interlinkings between families of words may be many and complicated.
10073-8{_}1536{_}Thus there is a family of _graph_ (or write) words: graphic, lithograph, cerograph, cinematograph, stylograph, telegraph, multigraph, seismograph, dictograph, monograph, holograph, logograph, digraph, autograph, paragraph, stenographer, photographer, biographer, lexicographer, bibliography, typography, pyrography, orthography, chirography, calligraphy, cosmography, geography.
10073-8{_}1537{_}There is also a family of _phone_ (or sound) words: telephone, dictaphone, megaphone, audiphone, phonology, symphony, antiphony, euphonious, cacophonous, phonetic spelling.
10073-8{_}1538{_}It chances that both families are of Greek extraction.
10073-8{_}1539{_}Related to the _graphs_--their cousins in fact--are the _grams_: telegram, radiogram, cryptogram, anagram, monogram, diagram, logogram, program, epigram, kilogram, ungrammatical.
10073-8{_}1540{_}Now a representative of the _graphs_ married into the _phone_ family, and we have graphophone.
10073-8{_}1541{_}A representative of the _phones_ married into the _graph_ family, and we have phonograph.
10073-8{_}1542{_}A representative of the _grams_ married into the _phone_ family, and we have gramophone.
10073-8{_}1543{_}A representative of the _phones_ married into the _gram_ family, and we have phonogram.
10073-8{_}1544{_}Of such unions children may be born.
10073-8{_}1545{_}For example, from the marriage of Mr.
10073-8{_}1546{_}Phone with Miss Graph were born phonography, phonographer, phonographist (a rather frail child), phonographic, phonographical, and phonographically.
10073-8{_}1547{_}Intermarriage between the _phones_ and the _graphs_ or _grams_ is a wedding of equals.
10073-8{_}1548{_}Some families of words, however, are of inferior social standing to other families, and may seek but not hope to be sought in marriage.
10073-8{_}1549{_}Compare the _ex's_ with the _ports_.
10073-8{_}1550{_}An _ex_, as a preposition, belongs to a prolific family but not one of established and unimpeachable dignity.
10073-8{_}1551{_}Hence the _ex's_, though they marry right and left, lead the other words to the altar and are never led thither themselves.
10073-8{_}1552{_}Witness exclude, excommunicate, excrescence, excursion, exhale, exit, expel, expunge, expense, extirpate, extract; in no instance does _ex_ fellow its connubial mate--it invariably precedes.
10073-8{_}1553{_}The _ports_, on the other hand, are the peers of anybody.
10073-8{_}1554{_}Some of them choose to remain single: port, porch, portal, portly, porter, portage.
10073-8{_}1555{_}Here and there one marries into another family: portfolio, portmanteau, portable, port arms.
10073-8{_}1556{_}More often, however, they are wooed than themselves do the pleading: comport, purport, report, disport, transport, passport, deportment, importance, opportunity, importunate, inopportune, insupportable.
10073-8{_}1557{_}From our knowledge of the two families, therefore, we should surmise that if any marriage is to take place between them; an _ex_ must be the suitor.
10073-8{_}1558{_}The surmise would be sound.
10073-8{_}1559{_}There is such a term as _export_, but not as _portex_.
10073-8{_}1560{_}Now it is oftentimes possible to do business with a man without knowing whether he is a man or a bridal couple.
10073-8{_}1561{_}And so with a word.
10073-8{_}1562{_}But the knowledge of his domestic state and circumstances will not come amiss, and it may prove invaluable.
10073-8{_}1563{_}You may find that you can handle him to best advantage through a sagacious use of the influence of his wife.
10073-8{_}1564{_}EXERCISE - Marriage  1.
10073-8{_}1565{_}For each word in the lists of EXERCISE - Dictionary and Activity 1 for EXERCISE - Past, determine (a) whether it is single or married; (b) if it is married, whether the wedding is one between equals.
10073-8{_}1566{_}2.
10073-8{_}1567{_}Make a list of the married words in the first three paragraphs of the selection from Burke (Appendix 2).
10073-8{_}1568{_}For each of these words determine the exact nature and extent of the dowry brought by each of the contracting parties to the wedding.
10073-8{_}1569{_}<Prying Into a Word's Relationships>  Hitherto in our study of verbal relationships we have usually started with the family.
10073-8{_}1570{_}Having strayed (as by good luck) into an assembly of kinsmen, we have observed the common strain and the general characteristics, and have then "placed" the individual with reference to these.
10073-8{_}1571{_}But we do not normally meet words, any more than we meet men, in the domestic circle.
10073-8{_}1572{_}We meet them and greet them hastily as they hurry through the tasks of the day, with no other associates about them than such as chance or momentary need may dictate.
10073-8{_}1573{_}If we are to see anything of their family life, it must be through effort we ourselves put forth.
10073-8{_}1574{_}We must be inquisitive about their conjugal and blood relationships.
10073-8{_}1575{_}How, then, starting with the individual word, can you come into a knowledge of it, not in its public capacity, but in what is even more important, its personal connections?
10073-8{_}1576{_}You must form the habit of asking two questions about it: (1) Is it married?
10073-8{_}1577{_}(2) Of what family or families was it born?
10073-8{_}1578{_}If you can get an understanding answer to these two questions, an answer that will tell you what its relations stand for as well as what their name is, your inquiries will be anything but bootless.
10073-8{_}1579{_}Let us illustrate your procedure concretely.
10073-8{_}1580{_}Suppose you read or hear the word _conchology_.
10073-8{_}1581{_}It is a somewhat unusual word, but see what you can do with it yourself before calling on the dictionary to help you.
10073-8{_}1582{_}Observe the word closely, and you will obtain the answer to your first question.
10073-8{_}1583{_}_Conchology_ is no bachelor, no verbal old maid; it is a married pair.
10073-8{_}1584{_}Your second and more difficult task awaits you; you must ascertain the meaning of the family connections.
10073-8{_}1585{_}With Mr. Conch you are on speaking terms; you know him as one of the shells.
10073-8{_}1586{_}But the utmost you can recall about his wife is that she is one of a whole flock of _ologies_.
10073-8{_}1587{_}What significance does this relationship possess?
10073-8{_}1588{_}You are uncertain.
10073-8{_}1589{_}But do not thumb the dictionary yet.
10073-8{_}1590{_}Pass in mental review all the _ologies_ you can assemble.
10073-8{_}1591{_}Wait also for the others that through the unconscious operations of memory will tardily straggle in.
10073-8{_}1592{_}Be on the lookout for _ologies_ as you read, as you listen.
10073-8{_}1593{_}In time you will muster a sizable company of them.
10073-8{_}1594{_}And you will draw a conclusion as to the meaning of the blood that flows through their veins.
10073-8{_}1595{_}_Ology_ implies speech or study.
10073-8{_}1596{_}_Conchology_, then, must be the study of conches.
10073-8{_}1597{_}Your investigations thus far have done more than teach you the meaning of the word you began with.
10073-8{_}1598{_}They have brought you some of the by-products of the study of verbal kinships.
10073-8{_}1599{_}For you no longer pass the _ologies_ by with face averted or bow timidly ventured.
10073-8{_}1600{_}You have become so well acquainted with them that even a new one, wherever encountered, would flash upon you the face of a friend.
10073-8{_}1601{_}But now your desires are whetted.
10073-8{_}1602{_}You wish to find out how much you _can_ learn.
10073-8{_}1603{_}You at last consult the dictionary.
10073-8{_}1604{_}Here a huge obstacle confronts you.
10073-8{_}1605{_}The _ologies_, like the _ports_ (above), are a haughty clan; they are the wooed, rather than the wooing, members of most marital households that contain them.
10073-8{_}1606{_}Now the marriage licenses recorded in the dictionary are entered under the name of the suitor, not of the person sought.
10073-8{_}1607{_}Hence you labor under a severe handicap as you take the census of the _ologies_.
10073-8{_}1608{_}Let us imagine the handicap the most severe possible.
10073-8{_}1609{_}Let us suppose that no _ology_ had ever been the suitor.
10073-8{_}1610{_}Even so, you would not be entirely baffled.
10073-8{_}1611{_}For you could look up in the dictionary the _ologies_ you your self had been able to recall.
10073-8{_}1612{_}To what profit?
10073-8{_}1613{_}First, you could verify or correct your surmise as to what the _ological_ blood betokens.
10073-8{_}1614{_}Secondly, you could perhaps obtain cross-references to yet other _ologies_ than those you remembered.
10073-8{_}1615{_}But you are not reduced to these extremities.
10073-8{_}1616{_}The _ologies_, arrogant as they are, sometimes are the applicants for matrimony, and the marriage registry of the dictionary so indicates.
10073-8{_}1617{_}To be sure, they do not, when thus appearing at the beginning of words, take the form _ology_.
10073-8{_}1618{_}They take the form _log_.
10073-8{_}1619{_}But you must be resourceful enough to keep after your quarry in spite of the omission of a vowel or two.
10073-8{_}1620{_}Also from some lexicons you may obtain still further help.
10073-8{_}1621{_}You may find _ology, logy, logo_, or _log_ listed as a combining form, its meaning given, and examples of its use in compounds cited.
10073-8{_}1622{_}By your zeal and persistence you have now brought together a goodly array of the _ologies_--all or most, let us say, of the following: conchology, biology, morphology, phrenology, physiology, osteology, histology, zoology, entomology, bacteriology, ornithology, pathology, psychology, cosmology, eschatology, demonology, mythology, theology, astrology, archeology, geology, meteorology, mineralogy, chronology, genealogy, ethnology, anthropology, criminology, technology, doxology, anthology, trilogy, philology, etymology, terminology, neologism, phraseology, tautology, analogy, eulogy, apology, apologue, eclogue, monologue, dialogue, prologue, epilogue, decalogue, catalogue, travelogue, logogram, logograph, logo-type, logarithms, logic, illogical.
10073-8{_}1623{_}(Moreover you may have perceived in some of these words the kinship which exists in all for the _loquy_ group--see (1) Soliloquy below.)
10073-8{_}1624{_}Of course you will discard some items from this list as being too learned for your purposes.
10073-8{_}1625{_}But you will observe of the others that once you know the meaning of _ology_, you are likely to know the whole word.
10073-8{_}1626{_}Thus from your study of _conchology_ you have mastered, not an individual term, but a tribe.
10073-8{_}1627{_}In _conchology_ only one element, _ology_, was really dubious at the outset.
10073-8{_}1628{_}Let us take a word of which both elements give you pause.
10073-8{_}1629{_}Suppose your thought is arrested by the word _eugenics_.
10073-8{_}1630{_}You perhaps know the word as a whole, but not its components.
10073-8{_}1631{_}For by looking at it and thinking about it you decide that its state is married, that it comprises the household of Mr. Eu and his wife, formerly Miss Gen.
10073-8{_}1632{_}But you cannot say offhand just what kind of person either Mr. Eu or the erstwhile Miss Gen is likely to prove.
10073-8{_}1633{_}Have you met any of the _Eu's_ elsewhere?
10073-8{_}1634{_}You think vaguely that you have, but cannot lay claim to any real acquaintance.
10073-8{_}1635{_}To the dictionary you accordingly betake yourself.
10073-8{_}1636{_}There you find that Mr. Eu is of a family quite respectable but not prone to marriage.
10073-8{_}1637{_}_Euphony, eupepsia, euphemism, euthanasia_ are of his retiring kindred.
10073-8{_}1638{_}The meaning of the _eu_ blood, so the dictionary informs you, is well.
10073-8{_}1639{_}The _gen_ blood, as you see exemplified in gentle, general, genital, engender, carries with it the idea of begetting, of producing, of birth, or (by extension) of kinship.
10073-8{_}1640{_}_Eugenics_, then, is an alliance of well and begotten (or born).
10073-8{_}1641{_}Your immediate purpose is fulfilled; but you resolve, let us say, to make the acquaintance of more of the _gens_, whose number you have perceived to be legion.
10073-8{_}1642{_}You are duly introduced to the following: genus, generic, genre, gender, genitive, genius, general, Gentile, gentle, gentry, gentleman, genteel, generous, genuine, genial, congeniality, congener, genital, congenital, engender, generation, progeny, progenitor, genesis, genetics, eugenics, pathogenesis, biogenesis, ethnogeny, palingenesis, unregenerate, degenerate, monogeny, indigenous, exogenous, homogeneous, heterogeneous, genealogy, ingenuous, ingenious, ingenue, engine, engineer, hygiene, hydrogen, oxygen, endogen, primogeniture, philoprogeniture, miscegenation.
10073-8{_}1643{_}Some of these are professional rather than social; you decide not to leave your card at their doors.
10073-8{_}1644{_}Others have assumed a significance somewhat un_gen_-like, though the relationship may be traced if you are not averse to trouble, Thus _engine_ in its superficial aspects seems alien to the idea of born.
10073-8{_}1645{_}But it is the child of _ingenious_ (innate, inborn); _ingenious_ is the inborn power to accomplish, and _engine_ is the result of the application of that power.
10073-8{_}1646{_}Whether you care to bother with such subtleties or not, enough _gens_ are left to make the family one well worth your cultivation.
10073-8{_}1647{_}Thus by studying two words, _conchology_ and _eugenics_, you have for the first time placed yourself on an intimate footing with three verbal families--the _ologies_, the _eu's,_ and the _gens_.
10073-8{_}1648{_}Observe that though you studied the _ologies_ apart from the _eu's_ and the _gens_, your knowledge--once you have acquired it--cannot be kept pigeonholed, for the _ologies_ have intermarried with both the other families.
10073-8{_}1649{_}Hence you on meeting _eulogy_ can exclaim: "How do you do, Mr. Eu?
10073-8{_}1650{_}I am honored in making your acquaintance, Mrs. Eu--I was about to call you by your maiden name; for I am a friend of your sister, the Miss Ology who married Mr. Conch.
10073-8{_}1651{_}And you too, Mr. Eu--I cannot regard you as a stranger.
10073-8{_}1652{_}I have looked in so often on the family of your brother--the Euphony family, I mean.
10073-8{_}1653{_}What a beautiful literary household it is!
10073-8{_}1654{_}Yet it has been neglected by the world-yea, even by the people who write.
10073-8{_}1655{_}Well, the loss is theirs who do the neglecting."
10073-8{_}1656{_}And _genealogy_ you can greet with an equal parade of family lore: "Don't trouble to tell me who you are.
10073-8{_}1657{_}I am hob and nob with your folks on both sides of the family, and my word for it, the relationship is written all over you.
10073-8{_}1658{_}Mr. Gen, I envy you the pride you must feel in the prominence given nowadays to the _eugenics_ household.
10073-8{_}1659{_}And it must delight you, Miss Ology-that-was, that connoisseurs are so keenly interested in _conchology_.
10073-8{_}1660{_}How are Grandfather Gen and Grandmother Ology?
10073-8{_}1661{_}They were keeping up remarkably the last time I saw them."
10073-8{_}1662{_}Do you think words will not respond to cordiality like this?
10073-8{_}1663{_}They will work their flattered heads off for you!
10073-8{_}1664{_}EXERCISE - Relationships  1.
10073-8{_}1665{_}For each of the following words (a) determine what families are intermarried, (b) ascertain the exact contribution to the household by each family represented, and (c) make as complete a list as possible of cognate words.
10073-8{_}1666{_}Reject     Oppose     Convent     Defer     Omit     Produce     Expel  2.
10073-8{_}1667{_}Test the extent of the intermarriages among these words by successively attaching each of the prefixes to each of the main (or key) syllables.
10073-8{_}1668{_}(Thus re-ject, re-fer, re-pel, etc.)
10073-8{_}1669{_}<Two Admonitions>  In tracing verbal kinships you must be prepared for slight variations in the form of the same key-syllable.
10073-8{_}1670{_}Consider these words: wise, wiseacre, wisdom, wizard, witch, wit, unwitting, to wit, outwit, twit, witticism, witness, evidence, providence, invidious, advice, vision, visit, vista, visage, visualize, envisage, invisible, vis-à-vis, visor, revise, supervise, improvise, proviso, provision, view, review, survey, vie, envy, clairvoyance.
10073-8{_}1671{_}Perhaps the last six should be disregarded as too exceptional in form to be clearly recognized.
10073-8{_}1672{_}And certainly some words, as _prudence_ from _providentia_, are so metamorphosed that they should be excluded from practical lists of this kind.
10073-8{_}1673{_}But even in the words left to us there are fairly marked divergences in appearance.
10073-8{_}1674{_}Why?
10073-8{_}1675{_}Because the key-syllable has descended to us, not through one language, but through several.
10073-8{_}1676{_}As good verbal detectives we should be able to penetrate the consequent disguises; for _wis, wiz, wit, vid, vic_, and _vis_ all embody the idea of seeing or knowing.
10073-8{_}1677{_}On the other hand, you must take care not to be misled by a superficial resemblance into thinking two unrelated key-syllables identical.
10073-8{_}1678{_}Let us consider two sets of words.
10073-8{_}1679{_}The first, which is related to the _tain_ group (see <Tain> below), has a key-syllable that means holding: tenant, tenement, tenure, tenet, tenor, tenable, tenacious, contents, contentment, lieutenant, maintenance, sustenance, countenance, appurtenance, detention, retentive, pertinacity, pertinent, continent, abstinence, continuous, retinue.
10073-8{_}1680{_}The second has a key-syllable that means stretching: tend, tender, tendon, tendril, tendency, extend, subtend, distend, pretend, contend, attendant, tense, tension, pretence, intense, intensive, ostensible, tent, tenterhook, portent, attention, intention, tenuous, attenuate, extenuate, antenna, tone, tonic, standard.
10073-8{_}1681{_}The form of the key-syllable for the first set of words is usually _ten, tent_, or _tin_; that for the second _tend, tens, tent_, or _ten_.
10073-8{_}1682{_}You may therefore easily confuse the two groups until you have learned to look past appearances into meanings.
10073-8{_}1683{_}Thenceforth the holdings and the stretchings will be distinct in your mind--will constitute two great families, not one.
10073-8{_}1684{_}Of course individual words may still puzzle you.
10073-8{_}1685{_}You will not perceive that _tender_, for example, belongs with the stretchings until you go back to its primary idea of something stretched thin, or that _tone_ has membership in that family until you connect it with the sound which a stretched chord emits.
10073-8{_}1686{_}FIRST GENERAL EXERCISE FOR THE CHAPTER  Each of the key-syllables given below is followed by (1) a list of fairly familiar words that embody it, (2) a list of less familiar words that embody it, (3) several sentences containing blank spaces, into each of which you are ultimately to fit the appropriate word from the first list.
10073-8{_}1687{_}(The existence of the two lists will show you that learned words may have commonplace kinfolks.)
10073-8{_}1688{_}First, however, you are to study each word in both lists for (1) its exact meaning, (2) the influence of the key-syllable upon that meaning, (3) any variation of the key-syllable from its ordinary form.
10073-8{_}1689{_}(A few words have been introduced to show how varied the forms may be and yet remain recognizable.)
10073-8{_}1690{_}Also, as an aid to your memory, you are to copy each list, underscoring the key-syllable each time you encounter it.
10073-8{_}1691{_}(The lists are practical, not meticulously academic.
10073-8{_}1692{_}In many instances they contain words derived, not from a single original, but from cognates.
10073-8{_}1693{_}No list is exhaustive.)

10073-8{_}2326{_}Our second was the study of individual words in two of their aspects--first, as they are seen in isolation, next as they are seen in verbal families.
10073-8{_}2327{_}Now our third task confronts us.
10073-8{_}2328{_}It is the study of words as they are associated, not in actual blood kinship, but in meaning.
10073-8{_}2329{_}Such an association in meaning may involve only two words (pairs) or larger groups.
10073-8{_}2330{_}In this chapter we shall confine ourselves to the study of pairs.
10073-8{_}2331{_}Of the relationship between pairs there are three types.
10073-8{_}2332{_}In the first the words are hostile to each other.
10073-8{_}2333{_}In the second they may easily be confused with each other.
10073-8{_}2334{_}In the third they are parallel with each other.
10073-8{_}2335{_}We shall examine the three types successively.
10073-8{_}2336{_}But we must make an explanation first.
10073-8{_}2337{_}Although we shall, in this and the following chapters, have frequent occasion to give the meanings of individual words, we shall give them without regard to dictionary methods.
10073-8{_}2338{_}We shall not attempt formal, water-tight, or exhaustive definitions; our purpose is to convey, in the simplest and most human manner possible, brief general explanations of what the words stand for.
10073-8{_}2339{_}<Opposites>  Pairs of the first type are made up of words by nature opposite to each other, or else thought of as opposite because they are so often contrasted.
10073-8{_}2340{_}Here is a familiar, everyday list:  east, west       straight, crooked       myself, others large, small     pretty, ugly            major, minor laugh, cry       walk, ride              light, darkness top, bottom      hard, soft              friend, enemy sweet, sour      clean, dirty            temporal, spiritual meat, drink      merry, sad              means, extremes land, water      private, public         Jew, Gentile man, woman       noisy, quiet            independent, dependent old, new         general, particular     sublime, ridiculous age, youth       wholesale, retail       give, receive sick, well       savage, civilized       pride, humility brain, brawn     wealth, poverty         constructive, destructive soul, body       positive, negative  None of these words needs explaining.
10073-8{_}2341{_}If you think of one of them, you will think of its opposite; at least its opposite will be lurking in the back of your mind.
10073-8{_}2342{_}As proof of this fact you have only to glance at the following list, from which the second member of each pair is omitted:  hot--         black--       boy--        in-- off--         over--        love--       wrong-- strong--      wet--         first--      day-- long--        fast--        good--       hope-- least--       asleep--      buy--        left-- alive--       winter--      war--        succeed-- creditor--    fat--         internal--   wise-- drunk--  Many words of a more difficult kind are thus pitted against each other, and we learn them, not singly, but in pairs.
10073-8{_}2343{_}At least we should.
10073-8{_}2344{_}As good verbal hunters we should be alert to the chance of killing two birds with one stone.
10073-8{_}2345{_}_Allopath_ and _homeopath_, for example, are difficult opposites.
10073-8{_}2346{_}We know of the existence of the two classes of medical practitioners; we know that they use different methods; but beyond this our knowledge is likely to be hazy.
10073-8{_}2347{_}Let us set out, then, to _learn_ the two words.
10073-8{_}2348{_}The best way is to learn them together.
10073-8{_}2349{_}_Allopathy_ means other suffering, _homeopathy_ like suffering.
10073-8{_}2350{_}An allopath uses remedies which create within the patient a condition that squarely conflicts with the further progress of the disease.
10073-8{_}2351{_}A homeopath prescribes medicines (in small doses) which produce within the patient the same condition that the disease would produce; he "beats the disease to it," so to speak--takes the job himself and leaves the disease nothing to do.
10073-8{_}2352{_}The allopath travels around a race-track in the opposite direction from the disease, and thwarts it through a head-on collision.
10073-8{_}2353{_}The homeopath travels around the race-track in the same direction as the disease, and thwarts it by pulling at the reins.
10073-8{_}2354{_}If we consider the two words together and get these ideas in mind, we shall have no further trouble with allopaths and homeopaths--except, perhaps, when they have rendered their services and presented their bills.
10073-8{_}2355{_}_Objective_ and _subjective_ are also a troublesome pair.
10073-8{_}2356{_}A thing is objective if it is an actual object or being, if it exists in itself rather than in our surmises.
10073-8{_}2357{_}A thing is subjective if it is the creature of a state of mind, if it has its existence in the thought or imagination of some person or other.
10073-8{_}2358{_}Thus if I meet a bear in the wilds, that bear is objective; whatever may be the state of my thoughts, _he is there_--and it would be to my advantage to reckon with this fact.
10073-8{_}2359{_}But if a child who is sent off to bed alone says there is a bear in the room, the bear is subjective; it is not a living monster that will devour anybody, but a creature called into the mind of the child through dread.
10073-8{_}2360{_}EXERCISE - Opposites  Study the following words in pairs.
10073-8{_}2361{_}Consult the dictionary for actual meanings.
10073-8{_}2362{_}Then test your knowledge by embodying each word of each pair in a sentence, or in an illustration like those of the race-track and the bear in the preceding paragraphs.

10073-8{_}2364{_}Sometimes the words are actually akin to each other.
10073-8{_}2365{_}_Continuous- continual_ and _enormity-enormousness_ are examples.
10073-8{_}2366{_}Sometimes they merely look or sound much alike.
10073-8{_}2367{_}_Mean-demean_ and _affect- effect_ are examples.
10073-8{_}2368{_}Sometimes the things they designate are more or less related, so that the ideas behind the words rather than the words themselves are responsible for the confusion.
10073-8{_}2369{_}_Contagious-infectious_ and _knowledge-wisdom_ are examples.
10073-8{_}2370{_}Let us distinguish between the two members of each of the pairs named.
10073-8{_}2371{_}A thing is _continuous_ if it suffers no interruption whatever, _continual_ if it is broken at regular intervals but as regularly renewed.
10073-8{_}2372{_}Thus "a continuous stretch of forest"; "the continual drip of water from the eaves."
10073-8{_}2373{_}_Enormity_ pertains to the moral and sometimes the social, _enormousness_ to the physical.
10073-8{_}2374{_}Thus "the enormity of the crime," "the enormity of this social offense"; "the enormousness of prehistoric animals."
10073-8{_}2375{_}_Demean_ is often used reproachfully because of its supposed relation to _mean_.
10073-8{_}2376{_}But it has nothing to do with _mean_.
10073-8{_}2377{_}The word with which to connect it is _demeanor_ (conduct).
10073-8{_}2378{_}Thus "We observed how he demeaned himself" implies no adverse criticism of either the man or his deportment.
10073-8{_}2379{_}Both may be debased to be sure, but they may be exemplary.
10073-8{_}2380{_}To _affect_ means to feign or to have an influence upon, to _effect_ to bring to pass.
10073-8{_}2381{_}Thus "He affects a fondness for classical music," "The little orphan's story affected those who heard it"; "We effected a compromise."
10073-8{_}2382{_}_Affect_ is never properly used as a noun.
10073-8{_}2383{_}_Effect_ as a noun means result, consequence, or practical operation.
10073-8{_}2384{_}Thus "The shot took instant effect"; "He put this idea into effect."
10073-8{_}2385{_}A disease is _contagious_ when the only way to catch it is through direct contact with a person already having it, or through contact with articles such a person has used.
10073-8{_}2386{_}A disease is _infectious_ when it is presumably caused, not by contact with a person, but through widespread general conditions, as of climate or sanitation.
10073-8{_}2387{_}Our _knowledge_ is our acquaintance with a fact, or the sum total of our information.
10073-8{_}2388{_}Our _wisdom_ is our intellectual and spiritual discernment, to which our knowledge is one of the contributors.
10073-8{_}2389{_}_Knowledge_ comprises the materials; _wisdom_ the ability to use them to practical advantage and to worthy or noble purpose.
10073-8{_}2390{_}_Knowledge_ is mental possession; _wisdom_ is mental and moral power.

10073-8{_}2572{_}This class somewhat overlaps the second; many terms that are frequently confused are parallels, and parallelism is of course a cause of confusion.
10073-8{_}2573{_}Parallels are words that show likeness in meaning.
10073-8{_}2574{_}Likeness, not sameness.
10073-8{_}2575{_}Yet at one time actual sameness may have existed, and in many instances did.
10073-8{_}2576{_}Nowadays this sameness has been lost, and the words have become differentiated.
10073-8{_}2577{_}As a rule they still are closely related in thought; sometimes, however, the divergence between them is wide.
10073-8{_}2578{_}Why did words having the same meaning find lodgment in the language in the first place?
10073-8{_}2579{_}The law of linguistic economy forbids any such happening, and only through sheer good fortune did English come to possess duplications.
10073-8{_}2580{_}The original Anglo-Saxon did not contain them.
10073-8{_}2581{_}But the Roman Catholic clergy brought to England the language of religion and of scholarship, Latin.
10073-8{_}2582{_}Later the Normans, whose speech as a branch of French was an offshoot of Latin, came to the island as conquerors.
10073-8{_}2583{_}For a time, therefore, three languages existed side by side in the country--Anglo- Saxon among the common folk, Latin among the clergy, and Norman-French at the court and among the nobility.
10073-8{_}2584{_}The coalescing of the three (or of the two if we count Latin in its direct and indirect contributions as one) was inevitable.
10073-8{_}2585{_}But other (mostly cognate) languages also had a part in the speech that was ultimately evolved.
10073-8{_}2586{_}The Anglo-Saxon element was augmented by words from Dutch, Scandinavian, and the  Germanic tongues in general; and Latin was reinforced by Greek.
10073-8{_}2587{_}Thus to imply, as is sometimes done, that modern English is simply a blend of Anglo-Saxon and Latin elements is misleading.
10073-8{_}2588{_}_Native_ and _classic_ are the better terms to use, provided both are used broadly.
10073-8{_}2589{_}_Native_ must include not only Anglo-Saxon but the other Germanic elements as well, and _classic_ must include French and Greek as well as Latin.
10073-8{_}2590{_}The welding of these languages made available two--in some instances more than two--words for a single object or idea.
10073-8{_}2591{_}What became of these duplicates?
10073-8{_}2592{_}Sometimes one of the words was dropped as needless.
10073-8{_}2593{_}Oftentimes, however, both were retained--with such modifications in meaning that thereafter they designated, not the same object or idea, but different forms or aspects of it.
10073-8{_}2594{_}Thus they became parallels, and the new language waxed rich with discriminations which neither of the component tongues had possessed.
10073-8{_}2595{_}Scott in _Ivanhoe_ gives the basis upon which the unification of the languages proceeded.
10073-8{_}2596{_}The jester Wamba in conversation with the swineherd Gurth explains how the Anglo-Saxon term took on the homelier, rougher, more workaday uses and left the more refined and fastidious uses for the Norman-French.
10073-8{_}2597{_}A domestic animal, says Wamba, was cared for by the conquered people, and in consequence bore while living a "good Saxon" name--swine, ox, or calf; but it was served at the tables of the conquerors, and therefore when ready for consumption bore a "good Norman-French" name--pork, beef, or veal.
10073-8{_}2598{_}"When the brute [a sow] lives, and is in charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes Norman and is called pork, when she is carried into the castle hall to feast among the nobles....
10073-8{_}2599{_}He [a calf] is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a Norman name [Monsieur de Veau] when he becomes matter of enjoyment."
10073-8{_}2600{_}Let us see how Scott's contention fares if we extend his list of terms relative to animal life.
10073-8{_}2601{_}As throughout the rest of this chapter, with the single and necessary exception of List B, the first word in each pair is native, the second classic:   <LIST A>  sheep, mutton          deer, venison        horse, equine cow, bovine            bull, taurine        sheep, ovine wolf, lupine           hog, porcine         bear, ursine fox, vulpine           cat, feline          dog, canine fish, piscatorial      mouse, vermin        rat, rodent mankind, humanity      man, masculine       woman, feminine childish, infantile    boyish, puerile  A glance at this list will show that, at least as regards animal life, the native word is likely to be the more familiar and unpretentious.
10073-8{_}2602{_}But we must not leap to the conclusion that, taking the language as a whole, the simple, easy word is sure to be native, the abstruse word classic.
10073-8{_}2603{_}In the following list one word in each pair is simpler, oftentimes much simpler, than the other; yet both are of classic origin.

10073-8{_}2606{_}Thus of the pair _sweat-perspiration, sweat_ is the plain-spoken, everyday member, _perspiration_ the polite, even learned member.
10073-8{_}2607{_}The man of limited vocabulary says _sweat_; even the sophisticated person, unless there is occasion to soften effects, finds _sweat_ the more natural term.
10073-8{_}2608{_}No one would say that a horse perspires.
10073-8{_}2609{_}No one would say that human beings must eat their bread in the perspiration of their faces.
10073-8{_}2610{_}But _sweat_ is a word of connotation too vigorous (though honest withal) for us to use the term in the drawing room.
10073-8{_}2611{_}A questionable woman in _The Vicar of Wakefield_ betrays her lack of breeding by the remark that she is in a muck of sweat.
10073-8{_}2612{_}The native word, besides being in itself simpler and starker than the classic, makes stronger appeal to our feelings and affections.
10073-8{_}2613{_}In nearly every instance the objects and relationships that have woven themselves into the very texture of our lives are designated by native terms.
10073-8{_}2614{_}Even if they are not so designated solely, they are so designated in their more cherished aspects.
10073-8{_}2615{_}We warm more to the native _fatherly_ than to the classic _paternal_.
10073-8{_}2616{_}We have a deeper sentiment for the native _home_ than for the classic _residence_.
10073-8{_}2617{_}That the native is the more downright term may be seen from the following words.
10073-8{_}2618{_}(These pairs are of course merely illustrative.
10073-8{_}2619{_}With them might be grouped a few special pairs, like _devilish-diabolical_ and _church_-_ecclesiastical_, of which the first members are classic in origin but of such early naturalization into English that they may be regarded as native.)

10073-8{_}2623{_}Our lists of parallels, however, though (with the exception of List B) they are arranged to bring out this duality of origin, have other and more vital uses as material for exercises.

10073-8{_}2626{_}Your task must be to ascertain the differences in import between the words thus joined.
10073-8{_}2627{_}EXERCISE - Parallels  <LIST G>  Study the discriminations between the members of the following pairs.
10073-8{_}2628{_}At each blank in the illustrative sentences insert the appropriate word.
10073-8{_}2629{_}<Brotherly, fraternal.> _Brotherly_ is used of actual blood kinship, or indicates close feeling, deep affection, or religious love.
10073-8{_}2630{_}_Fraternal_ is used less personally and intimately; it normally betokens that the relations are at least in part formal (as relations within societies).
10073-8{_}2631{_}"The sight of the button on the stranger's lapel caused Wilkes to give him the cabalistic sign and ask his ____ assistance."
10073-8{_}2632{_}"Though the children of different parents, we bear for each other a true ____ devotion."
10073-8{_}2633{_}"Because we both are newspaper men I feel a ____ interest in him."
10073-8{_}2634{_}<Daily, diurnal.> _Daily_, the popular word, is often used loosely.
10073-8{_}2635{_}We may say that we eat three meals daily without implying that we have never gone dinnerless.
10073-8{_}2636{_}_Diurnal_, the scientific term, is used exactly, whether applying to the period of daylight or to the whole twenty-four hours.
10073-8{_}2637{_}A diurnal flower closes at night; a diurnal motion is precisely coincident with the astronomical day.
10073-8{_}2638{_}In poetry, however, _diurnal_ is often used for _daily_.
10073-8{_}2639{_}"Give us this day our ____ bread."
10073-8{_}2640{_}"The ____ rotation of the earth on its axis is the cause of our day and night."
10073-8{_}2641{_}"Fred and I went for our ____ ramble through the hills."
10073-8{_}2642{_}<Cold, frigid.> Which is the more popular word?
10073-8{_}2643{_}Let us see.
10073-8{_}2644{_}Would the man in the street be more likely to use one than the other?
10073-8{_}2645{_}Which one?
10073-8{_}2646{_}Does this answer our question?
10073-8{_}2647{_}Another question: Which word is the more inclusive in meaning?
10073-8{_}2648{_}Again, let us see.
10073-8{_}2649{_}A blacksmith is beating iron; does the iron grow cold or frigid?
10073-8{_}2650{_}Which term, then, approaches the closer in meaning to the idea of mere coolness?
10073-8{_}2651{_}On the other hand, may that same term represent a temperature far beyond mere coolness?
10073-8{_}2652{_}Would you speak of a morning as bitterly cold or bitterly frigid?
10073-8{_}2653{_}Now think of the term you have not been using.
10073-8{_}2654{_}_Can_ it convey as wide meanings, or is it limited in range?
10073-8{_}2655{_}Does the word _frigid_ carry for you a geographical suggestion (to the frigid zone)?
10073-8{_}2656{_}Do you yourself use the term?
10073-8{_}2657{_}If so, do you use it chiefly (perhaps entirely) in connection with human temperament or demeanor?
10073-8{_}2658{_}Is _cold_ used thus figuratively also?
10073-8{_}2659{_}Which is the more often thus used?
10073-8{_}2660{_}"I suffer from ____ hands and feet."
10073-8{_}2661{_}"The slopes of Mont Blanc are ____ with eternal snow."
10073-8{_}2662{_}"He did not warm to the idea at all.
10073-8{_}2663{_}His inclinations are absolutely ____."
10073-8{_}2664{_}<Manly, virile>.
10073-8{_}2665{_}_Manly_ implies possession of traits or qualities a man should possess; it may be used of immature persons.
10073-8{_}2666{_}_Virile_ implies maturity and robust masculinity; it is also used of the power to procreate.
10073-8{_}2667{_}"A ____ lad."
10073-8{_}2668{_}"A ____ reply."
10073-8{_}2669{_}"____ energy."
10073-8{_}2670{_}"____ and aggressive."
10073-8{_}2671{_}"____ forbearance,"  <Inner, internal>.
10073-8{_}2672{_}_Inner_ is somewhat within, or more within than something else is; it is also used in figurative and spiritual senses.
10073-8{_}2673{_}_Internal_ is entirely within.
10073-8{_}2674{_}"The ____ organs of the human body."
10073-8{_}2675{_}"The ____ layer of the rind."
10073-8{_}2676{_}"The injury was ____."
10073-8{_}2677{_}"The ____ nature of man."
10073-8{_}2678{_}"The ____ meaning of the occurrence."
10073-8{_}2679{_}<Height, altitude>.
10073-8{_}2680{_}"He was five feet, eleven inches in height."
10073-8{_}2681{_}Can you substitute _altitude_?
10073-8{_}2682{_}Is _altitude_ used of persons?
10073-8{_}2683{_}"At an altitude of eleven feet from the ground."
10073-8{_}2684{_}Would _height_ be more natural?
10073-8{_}2685{_}Does _altitude_ betoken great height?
10073-8{_}2686{_}If so, does Hamlet speak jestingly when he greets the player, "Your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine?"
10073-8{_}2687{_}What of the sentence: "The altitude of Galveston was not sufficient to protect it from the tidal wave"?
10073-8{_}2688{_}Does the magnitude or importance of the object (Galveston) compensate for its lack of elevation and thus justify _altitude_?
10073-8{_}2689{_}Could _height_ be substituted?
10073-8{_}2690{_}If so, would the words _above sea-level_ have to follow it?
10073-8{_}2691{_}Does this fact give you a further clue as to the distinction between the two words?
10073-8{_}2692{_}You are comparing the elevation of two peaks, both plainly visible; you measure them merely by your eye.
10073-8{_}2693{_}Do you say "This exceeds the other in height" or "This exceeds the other in altitude"?
10073-8{_}2694{_}Suppose the peaks are so distant from each other that the two are not visible simultaneously, and suppose you are speaking from a knowledge of the scientific measurements.
10073-8{_}2695{_}Do you say "This exceeds the other in height" or "This exceeds the other in altitude"?
10073-8{_}2696{_}<Talk, conversation>.
10073-8{_}2697{_}_Talk_ may be one-sided and empty.
10073-8{_}2698{_}_Conversation_ requires that at least two shall participate, and it is not spoken of as empty, though it may be trivial.
10073-8{_}2699{_}"Our ____ was somewhat desultory."
10073-8{_}2700{_}"Thought is less general than ____."
10073-8{_}2701{_}"His ____ was so lively that I had no chance to interrupt" "That is meaningless ____."
10073-8{_}2702{_}<Homesickness, nostalgia>.
10073-8{_}2703{_}All of us have heard physicians call commonplace ailments by extraordinary names.
10073-8{_}2704{_}When homesickness reaches the stage where a physician is or might be called in, it becomes nostalgia.
10073-8{_}2705{_}The latter term suggests morbid or chronic suffering.
10073-8{_}2706{_}A healthy boy away from home for the first time is homesick.
10073-8{_}2707{_}An exile who has wasted himself with pining for his native land is nostalgic.
10073-8{_}2708{_}"His ____ was more than ____; it had so preyed upon his thoughts that it had grown into ____."
10073-8{_}2709{_}Rise, ascend.
10073-8{_}2710{_}_Rise_ is the more general term, but it expresses less than _ascend_ in degree or stateliness.
10073-8{_}2711{_}"He had foretold to them that he would ____ into heaven."
10073-8{_}2712{_}"Do not ____ from your seat."
10073-8{_}2713{_}"The diver slowly ____ to the surface."
10073-8{_}2714{_}"The travelers ____ the mountain."
10073-8{_}2715{_}<Sell, vend>.
10073-8{_}2716{_}_Sell_ is the more dignified word socially, but may express greater moral degradation.
10073-8{_}2717{_}_Vend_ is used of the petty (as that which can be carried about in a wagon), and may suggest the pettily dishonest.
10073-8{_}2718{_}"That man would ____ his country."
10073-8{_}2719{_}"We shall ____ a million dollars' worth of goods."
10073-8{_}2720{_}"The hucksters ____ their wares."
10073-8{_}2721{_}<LIST H>  Study the discriminations between the members of the following pairs.
10073-8{_}2722{_}Determine whether the words are correctly used in the illustrative sentences.
10073-8{_}2723{_}(Some are; some are not.)
10073-8{_}2724{_}<Friendly, amicable>.
10073-8{_}2725{_}_Friendly_ denotes goodwill positive in quality though perhaps limited in degree; we may be friendly to friends, enemies, or strangers.
10073-8{_}2726{_}_Amicable_ is negative, denoting absence of open discord: it is used of those persons between whom some connection already exists.
10073-8{_}2727{_}"The newcomer has an amicable manner."
10073-8{_}2728{_}"Both sides were cautious, but at last they reached a friendly settlement."
10073-8{_}2729{_}"I have only amicable feelings for an enemy who is thus merciful."
10073-8{_}2730{_}"The two met, if not in a friendly, at least in an amicable way."
10073-8{_}2731{_}<Willing, voluntary>.
10073-8{_}2732{_}Both words imply an act of the will; but _willing_ adds positive good-nature, desire, or enthusiasm, whereas _voluntary_ conveys little or nothing of the emotional attitude.
10073-8{_}2733{_}_Voluntary_ is often thought of in contrast with _mechanical_.
10073-8{_}2734{_}"They made willing submission."
10073-8{_}2735{_}"They rendered whole-hearted and voluntary service."
10073-8{_}2736{_}"Though torn by desire to return to his mother, he willingly continued his journey away from her."
10073-8{_}2737{_}"The sneeze was unwilling."
10073-8{_}2738{_}<Greedy, voracious.> _Greedy_ denotes excessiveness (usually habitual) of appetite or, in its figurative uses, of desire; it nearly always carries the idea of selfishness.
10073-8{_}2739{_}_Voracious_ denotes intense hunger or the hasty and prolonged consumption of great quantities of food; it may indicate, not habitual selfishness, but the stress of circumstances.
10073-8{_}2740{_}"Nobody else I know is so greedy as he."
10073-8{_}2741{_}"The young poet was voracious of praise."
10073-8{_}2742{_}"Trench, though a capital fellow, was so hungry that he ate voraciously."
10073-8{_}2743{_}<Offspring, progeny.> _Offspring_ is likely to be used when our thought is chiefly on the children, _progeny_ when our thought is chiefly on the parents.
10073-8{_}2744{_}_Offspring_ may be used of one or many; _progeny_ is used in collective reference to many.
10073-8{_}2745{_}"He was third among the progeny who won distinction."
10073-8{_}2746{_}"They are the progeny of very rich parents."
10073-8{_}2747{_}"Clayton left his offspring well provided for."
10073-8{_}2748{_}<Ghost, spirit.> _Ghost_ is the narrower term.
10073-8{_}2749{_}It never expresses, as _spirit_ does, the idea of soul or of animating mood or purpose.
10073-8{_}2750{_}With reference to incorporeal beings, it denotes (except in the phrase "the Holy Ghost") the reappearance of the dead in disembodied form.
10073-8{_}2751{_}_Spirit_ may denote a variety of incorporeal beings--among them angels, fairies (devoid of moral nature), and personalities returned from the grave and manifested--seldom visibly--through spiritualistic tappings and the like.
10073-8{_}2752{_}"The superstitious natives thought the spirit of their chief walked in the graveyard."
10073-8{_}2753{_}"The ghost of the ancestors survives in the descendants."
10073-8{_}2754{_}"I can call spirits from the vasty deep."
10073-8{_}2755{_}<Foe, enemy.> Nowadays the chief difference between the two terms is that _foe_ is the more used in poetry, _enemy_ in prose.
10073-8{_}2756{_}But _foe_ tends to express the more personal and implacable hostility.
10073-8{_}2757{_}We do not think of foes as bearing any friendship for each other; enemies may, or they may be enemies in public affairs but downright friends in their private relations.
10073-8{_}2758{_}A man is hardly spoken of as being his own foe, but he may be his own enemy.
10073-8{_}2759{_}"For the moment we found ourselves foes."
10073-8{_}2760{_}"Suspicion is an enemy to content."
10073-8{_}2761{_}"I paid a tribute to my friend, who was the dominant personality among the enemy."
10073-8{_}2762{_}<Truth, veracity.> _Truth_ has to do with the accuracy of the statement, of the facts; _veracity_ with the intention of the person to say nothing false.
10073-8{_}2763{_}"I cannot vouch for the veracity of the story, but I can for the truth of the teller."
10073-8{_}2764{_}"Though he is not a man of veracity, I believe he is now speaking the truth."
10073-8{_}2765{_}"Veracity, crushed to earth, will rise again."
10073-8{_}2766{_}<Break, fracture>.
10073-8{_}2767{_}_Break_ is the broader term.
10073-8{_}2768{_}It need not refer clearly to the operation or result of external force, nor need it embody the idea that this force is brought against a hard substance.
10073-8{_}2769{_}In these respects it differs from _fracture_, as also in the fact that it may designate a mere interruption.
10073-8{_}2770{_}Furthermore it has figurative uses, whereas _fracture_ is narrowly literal.
10073-8{_}2771{_}"There was a fracture in the chain of mountains."
10073-8{_}2772{_}"The break in his voice was distinct."
10073-8{_}2773{_}"The fracture of the bones of his wrist incapacitated him."
10073-8{_}2774{_}"The fracture of the rope."
10073-8{_}2775{_}<Hug, embrace>.
10073-8{_}2776{_}To _hug_ is to clasp violently or enthusiastically, and perhaps ludicrously.
10073-8{_}2777{_}To _embrace_ is to clasp in a more dignified, perhaps even in a formal, way; the term also means to include, to comprise.
10073-8{_}2778{_}"This topic embraces the other."
10073-8{_}2779{_}"Did you see that ardent bumpkin embracing his sweetheart?"
10073-8{_}2780{_}"Her sister gave her a graceful but none too cordial hug."
10073-8{_}2781{_}"The wounded bear hugged the hunter ferociously."
10073-8{_}2782{_}<Shorten, abridge>.
10073-8{_}2783{_}The two terms overlap; but there is a fairly strong tendency to use _shorten_ for reduction in length, and _abridge_ for reduction in quantity or mass.
10073-8{_}2784{_}Both words are used figuratively as well as literally.
10073-8{_}2785{_}"The tyrant shortened the privileges of his subjects."
10073-8{_}2786{_}"We shortened the rope."
10073-8{_}2787{_}"The teacher abridged the recitation."
10073-8{_}2788{_}"The report of the committee appears in abridged form in Volume 2 of our records."
10073-8{_}2789{_}<LIST I>  With the help of the dictionary discriminate between the members of the following pairs.
10073-8{_}2790{_}Determine whether the words are correctly used in the illustrative sentences.
10073-8{_}2791{_}(Some are; some are not.)
10073-8{_}2792{_}<Fiery, inflammable>.
10073-8{_}2793{_}"He delivered a fiery address."
10073-8{_}2794{_}"The underbrush was dry and fiery."
10073-8{_}2795{_}"Your disposition is too inflammable."
10073-8{_}2796{_}<Lean, attenuated>.
10073-8{_}2797{_}"The fat man had grown attenuated."
10073-8{_}2798{_}"Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look."
10073-8{_}2799{_}"The hot metal was then drawn into an attenuated wire."
10073-8{_}2800{_}"Only a lean line of our soldiers faced the dense masses of the enemy."
10073-8{_}2801{_}<Home-like, domestic>.
10073-8{_}2802{_}"The scene was quiet and domestic."
10073-8{_}2803{_}"It is home-like, inexpressibly dear."
10073-8{_}2804{_}"To Waltham, heartsick from his wanderings, the room in all its arrangements was thoroughly domestic."
10073-8{_}2805{_}<Vigilant, watchful>.
10073-8{_}2806{_}"We must be vigilant if we would maintain our liberty."
10073-8{_}2807{_}"He was wakeful, even watchful, though not from set purpose."
10073-8{_}2808{_}"He was vigilant for evidences of friendship."
10073-8{_}2809{_}<Building, edifice>.
10073-8{_}2810{_}"It is a big, barn-like building."
10073-8{_}2811{_}"Spare yonder sacred edifice."
10073-8{_}2812{_}"This is the most imposing building I ever saw."
10073-8{_}2813{_}<Hole, aperture>.
10073-8{_}2814{_}"I poked a stick into the aperture which the crawfish had made."
10073-8{_}2815{_}"Through the aperture of the partly open door I gazed out on the street."
10073-8{_}2816{_}"The hole of the hornet's nest was black with the emerging and angry insects."
10073-8{_}2817{_}<Farming, agriculture>.
10073-8{_}2818{_}"Two hundred students graduated this year from the college of farming."
10073-8{_}2819{_}"For long years he had devoted himself to the homely, grinding tasks of agriculture."
10073-8{_}2820{_}"I have looked rather carefully into the theories of farming."
10073-8{_}2821{_}<Rest, repose>.
10073-8{_}2822{_}"He obtained some repose even while standing."
10073-8{_}2823{_}"We wished for a moment's rest from our exertions."
10073-8{_}2824{_}"Worn out, he was compelled to seek repose."
10073-8{_}2825{_}"Lincoln's face in repose was very melancholy."

10073-8{_}2829{_}"Aid us, O God, in our sore distress."
10073-8{_}2830{_}"The little fellow could not quite get the bundle to his shoulder; a passerby helped him."
10073-8{_}2831{_}<Hide, conceal>.
10073-8{_}2832{_}"By refraining from comment he hid his connection with the affair."
10073-8{_}2833{_}"Wild creatures hide themselves by means of their protective coloring."
10073-8{_}2834{_}"The frost on the panes conceals the landscape from you."

10073-8{_}2851{_}VII      SYNONYMS IN LARGER GROUPS (1)   In considering pairs we have, without using the word, been studying synonyms.
10073-8{_}2852{_}For most pairs are synonyms (or in some instances antonyms) that hunt in couples.
10073-8{_}2853{_}We must now deal with synonyms, and incidentally antonyms, as they associate themselves in larger groups.
10073-8{_}2854{_}A vocabulary is impoverished.
10073-8{_}2855{_}Why?
10073-8{_}2856{_}Nine times in ten, because of a disregard of synonyms.

10073-8{_}2858{_}Whatever is pleasing is _fine_ or _nice_ or _all to the good_; whatever is displeasing is _bum_ or _awful_ or _a fright_.

10073-8{_}2860{_}Out of such stereotyped utterance only the general idea emerges.
10073-8{_}2861{_}The precise meaning is lazily or incompetently left to the hearer to imagine.
10073-8{_}2862{_}The precise meaning?
10073-8{_}2863{_}There is none.
10073-8{_}2864{_}A person who does not take the trouble to speak clearly has not taken the trouble to think clearly.
10073-8{_}2865{_}But the master of synonyms expresses, instead of general, hazy, commonplace conceptions, the subtlest shadings of thought and feeling.
10073-8{_}2866{_}He has so trained himself that he selects, it may be unconsciously, from a throng of possible words.
10073-8{_}2867{_}One word may be strong, another weak.
10073-8{_}2868{_}One may be broad, another narrow.
10073-8{_}2869{_}One may present an alternative in meanings, another permit no liberty of choice.
10073-8{_}2870{_}One may be suggestive, another literal or colorless.
10073-8{_}2871{_}One may penetrate to the core of the idea, another strike only in the environs.
10073-8{_}2872{_}With these possibilities the master of synonyms reckons.
10073-8{_}2873{_}He must have the right word.
10073-8{_}2874{_}He chooses it, not at haphazard, but in conformity with a definite purpose.
10073-8{_}2875{_}For synonyms are not words that have the same meaning.
10073-8{_}2876{_}They are words that have similar meanings.
10073-8{_}2877{_}They may be compared to circles that overlap but do not coincide.
10073-8{_}2878{_}Each embraces a common area, but each embraces also an area peculiar to itself.
10073-8{_}2879{_}Though many words cluster about a given idea, rarely if ever are even two of these words entirely equivalent to each other.
10073-8{_}2880{_}In scope, in suggestion, in emotional nuance, in special usage, or what not, is sure to lurk some denial of perfect correspondence.
10073-8{_}2881{_}And of synonyms, so of antonyms.
10073-8{_}2882{_}Antonyms are words opposite in meaning; but the opposition, for the same reasons as the likeness, is seldom or never absolute.

10073-8{_}2903{_}<How to Acquire Synonyms>  The best principle for the extension of one's mastery of synonyms is the principle already used over and over in this book--that of proceeding from the known to the unknown.
10073-8{_}2904{_}It is the fundamental principle, indeed, of any kind of successful learning.
10073-8{_}2905{_}We should build on what we have, fit each new piece of material into the structure already erected.
10073-8{_}2906{_}But normally it is our ill fortune to learn through chance rather than through system.
10073-8{_}2907{_}We perceive elucidation here, draw an inference there.
10073-8{_}2908{_}These isolated fragments of knowledge may mislead rather than inform us.
10073-8{_}2909{_}The principle of proceeding from the known to the unknown may be applied to synonyms in various ways.
10073-8{_}2910{_}Two of these--the two of most importance--we must consider here.
10073-8{_}2911{_}First, you should reckon with your personal, demonstrated needs.
10073-8{_}2912{_}Just as you have already analyzed your working vocabulary for its general limits and shortcomings, so should you analyze it with particular reference to your poverty in synonyms.
10073-8{_}2913{_}Watch your actual speech; make a list of the words--nouns, verbs, and adjectives particularly--that you employ again and again.
10073-8{_}2914{_}Make each of these words the starting-point for a linguistic exploring expedition.
10073-8{_}2915{_}First, write the word down.
10073-8{_}2916{_}Then under it write all the synonyms that come forthwith to your mind.
10073-8{_}2917{_}These constitute your present available stock; in speaking or writing you could, if you kept yourself mentally alert, summon them on the moment.
10073-8{_}2918{_}But the list, as you know, is not exhaustive.
10073-8{_}2919{_}Draw a line under it and subjoin such synonyms as come to you after reflection.
10073-8{_}2920{_}These constitute a second stock, not instantaneously available, yet to be tagged as among your resources.
10073-8{_}2921{_}Next add a list of the synonyms you find through research, through a ransacking of dictionaries and books of synonyms.
10073-8{_}2922{_}This third stock, but dimly familiar if familiar at all, is in no practical sense yours.
10073-8{_}2923{_}And indeed some of the words are too abstruse, learned, or technical for you to burden your memory with them.
10073-8{_}2924{_}But many--most--are worth acquiring.
10073-8{_}2925{_}By writing down the words of these three classes you have done something to stamp them upon your memory as associates.
10073-8{_}2926{_}You must now make it your business to bring them into use.
10073-8{_}2927{_}Never call upon them for volunteers, but like a wise commander summon the individual that can rightly perform a particular service.
10073-8{_}2928{_}Thus will your speech, perhaps vague and indolent now, become exact, discriminating, competent, vital.
10073-8{_}2929{_}In the second place, you should obtain specific and detailed command of general ideas.
10073-8{_}2930{_}Not of out-of-the-way ideas.
10073-8{_}2931{_}But of the great basic ideas that are the common possession of all mankind.
10073-8{_}2932{_}For through these basic ideas is the most natural and profitable approach to the study of synonyms.
10073-8{_}2933{_}Each of them is represented by a generic word.
10073-8{_}2934{_}So elementary are idea and word alike that a person cannot have the one in mind without having the other ready and a-quiver on his tongue.
10073-8{_}2935{_}Every person is master of both.
10073-8{_}2936{_}But it is unsafe to predicate the person's acquaintance with the shades and phases of the idea, or with the corresponding discriminations in language.
10073-8{_}2937{_}He may not know them at all, he may know them partially, he may know them through and through.
10073-8{_}2938{_}Let us suppose him ignorant of them but determined to learn.
10073-8{_}2939{_}His progress, both in the thought and in the language, will be from the general to the specific.
10073-8{_}2940{_}His acquaintance with the idea in the large he will gradually extend to an acquaintance with it in detail, and his command of the broad term for it he will little by little supplement with definite terms for its phases.
10073-8{_}2941{_}An illustration will make this clear.
10073-8{_}2942{_}We are aware that the world is made up of various classes and conditions of men.
10073-8{_}2943{_}How did we learn this?
10073-8{_}2944{_}Let us go back to the time when our minds were a blank, when we were babes and sucklings, when we had not perceived that men exist, much less that mankind is infinitely complex.
10073-8{_}2945{_}A baby comes slowly to understand that all objects in the universe are divisible into two classes, human and non-human, and that a member of the former may be separated from the others and regarded as an individual.
10073-8{_}2946{_}It has reached the initial stage of its knowledge on the subject; it has the basic idea, that of the individual human being.
10073-8{_}2947{_}As soon as it can speak, it acquires a designating term--not of course the sophisticated _human being_, but the simpler _man_.
10073-8{_}2948{_}It uses this word in the generic sense, to indicate _any_ member of the human race; for as yet it knows nothing and cares nothing about differences in species.
10073-8{_}2949{_}With increasing enlightenment, however, it discerns five species, and distinguishes among them by swelling this branch of its vocabulary to five words: man (in the sense of adult male), woman, boy, girl, baby.
10073-8{_}2950{_}(To be sure, it may chance to have acquired a specific term, as _boy_ or _baby_, before the generic term _man_; but if so, it has attached this term to some particular individual, as the grocer's boy or itself, rather than to the individuals of a species.
10073-8{_}2951{_}Its understanding of the species as a species comes after its understanding of the genus.)
10073-8{_}2952{_}As time passes, it divides mankind into yet further species by sundry other methods: according to occupation, for example, as doctors, chauffeurs, gardeners; to race or color, as white men; negroes, Malays, Chinese; to disposition, as heroes, gift-givers, teasers, talkers; and so on.
10073-8{_}2953{_}It perceives moreover that species are made up of sub-species.
10073-8{_}2954{_}Thus instead of lumping all boys together it begins to distinguish them as big boys, little boys, middle-sized boys, boys in long trousers, boys in short trousers, barefoot boys, schoolboys, poor boys, rich boys, sick boys, well boys, friends, enemies, bullies, and what not.
10073-8{_}2955{_}It even divides the sub-species.
10073-8{_}2956{_}Thus it classifies schoolboys as bright boys, dullards, workers, shirkers, teachers' favorites, scapegoats, athletes, note-throwers, truant-players, and the like.
10073-8{_}2957{_}And of these classes it may make yet further sub-divisions, or at least it may separate them into the individuals that compose them.
10073-8{_}2958{_}In fine, with its growing powers and experience, it abandons its old conception that all persons are practically alike, and follows human nature through the countless ramifications of man's status, temperament, activities, or fate.
10073-8{_}2959{_}And it augments its vocabulary to keep pace, roughly at least, with its expanding ideas.
10073-8{_}2960{_}In thought and terminology alike its growth is from genus to species.
10073-8{_}2961{_}So it is with all our ideas and with all our words to cap them.
10073-8{_}2962{_}We radiate from an ascertained center into new areas of knowledge; we proceed from the broad, fundamental, generic to the precise, discriminatory, specific.
10073-8{_}2963{_}Upon this natural law are based the exercises in this chapter and the two to follow.
10073-8{_}2964{_}The starting-point is always a word representative of an elementary idea--a word and an idea which everybody knows; the advance is into the unknown or the unused, at any rate into the particular.
10073-8{_}2965{_}Now fundamental ideas are not very numerous, and these exercises include the commoner ones.
10073-8{_}2966{_}Such a method of studying synonyms must therefore yield large and tangible results.
10073-8{_}2967{_}One matter, however, should be explained.
10073-8{_}2968{_}Most books of synonyms start with a word and list all the terms in any way related to it.
10073-8{_}2969{_}The idea of the compilers is that the more they give the student the more they help him.
10073-8{_}2970{_}But oftentimes by giving more than is strictly pertinent they actually hinder and confuse him.
10073-8{_}2971{_}They may do this in various ways, of which two must be mentioned.
10073-8{_}2972{_}First, they follow an idea too far afield.
10073-8{_}2973{_}Thus in listing the synonyms of _love_ they include such terms as _kindness_ and _lenity_, words only through stretched usage connected with _love_.
10073-8{_}2974{_}Secondly, they trace, not one meaning of a word, but two or more unrelated meanings when the word chances to possess them.
10073-8{_}2975{_}Thus in listing the synonyms of _cry_ they include both the idea of weeping and the idea of calling or screaming.
10073-8{_}2976{_}What are the results of these methods?
10073-8{_}2977{_}The student finds a clutter where he expects rationalized order; he finds he must exclude many words which lie in the borders and fringes of the meaning.
10073-8{_}2978{_}Moreover he finds mere chance associations mingled with marked kinships.
10073-8{_}2979{_}In both cases he finds dulled distinctions.
10073-8{_}2980{_}This book offers synonyms that are apropos and definite rather than comprehensive.
10073-8{_}2981{_}Starting with a basic idea, it finds the generic term; it then disregards dim and distant relationships, confines itself rigorously to one of perhaps two or three legitimate senses, and refuses to consider the peculiar twists and devious ways of subsidiary words when they wander from the idea it is tracing.
10073-8{_}2982{_}It thus deliberately blinds itself to much that is interesting.
10073-8{_}2983{_}But this partial blindness enables it to concentrate attention upon the matter actually under study, to give sharper distinctions and surer guidance.
10073-8{_}2984{_}EXERCISE A  After three introductory groups (dealing with thoroughly concrete ideas and words) the synonyms in this exercise are arranged alphabetically according to the first word in each group.
10073-8{_}2985{_}This first word is generic.
10073-8{_}2986{_}It is immediately followed by a list of its synonyms.
10073-8{_}2987{_}These are then informally discriminated or else (in a few instances) questions are asked about them.
10073-8{_}2988{_}Perhaps a few less closely related synonyms are then listed for you to discriminate in a similar way.
10073-8{_}2989{_}Finally, illustrative sentences are given.
10073-8{_}2990{_}Each blank in these you are to fill with the word that conveys the meaning exactly.
10073-8{_}2991{_}(To prevent monotony and inattention, the number of illustrative sentences varies.
10073-8{_}2992{_}You may have to use a particular word more than once, and another word not at all.)
10073-8{_}2993{_}<Walk, plod, trudge, tread, stride, stalk, strut, tramp, march, pace, toddle, waddle, shuffle, mince, stroll, saunter, ramble, meander, promenade, prowl, hobble, limp, perambulate.>  Any one may be said to _walk_ who moves along on foot with moderate speed.
10073-8{_}2994{_}He _plods_ if he walks slowly and heavily, and perhaps monotonously or spiritlessly as well.
10073-8{_}2995{_}He _trudges_ if he walks toilsomely and wearily, as though his feet were heavy.
10073-8{_}2996{_}He _treads_ if his walk is suggestive of a certain lightness and caution--if, for instance, he seems half-uncertain whether to proceed and sets one foot down carefully before the other.
10073-8{_}2997{_}He _strides_ if he takes long steps, especially in a firm, pompous, or lofty manner.
10073-8{_}2998{_}He _stalks_ if there is a certain stiffness or haughtiness in his walking.
10073-8{_}2999{_}He _struts_ if he walks with a proud or affectedly dignified gait, especially if he also raises his feet high.
10073-8{_}3000{_}He _tramps_ if he goes for a long walk, as for pleasure or enjoyment out-of-doors.
10073-8{_}3001{_}He _marches_ if he walks in a measured, ordered way, especially in company with others.
10073-8{_}3002{_}He _paces_ if he engages in a measured, continuous walk, as from nervousness, impatience, or anger.
10073-8{_}3003{_}He _toddles_ if his steps are short, uneven, and unsteady, like those of a child.
10073-8{_}3004{_}He _waddles_ if his movement is ungainly, with a duck-like swaying from side to side.
10073-8{_}3005{_}He _shuffles_ if he drags his feet with a scraping noise.
10073-8{_}3006{_}He _minces_ if he takes short steps in a prim, precise, or affectedly nice manner.
10073-8{_}3007{_}He _strolls_ or _saunters_ if he goes along in an easy, aimless, or idle fashion.
10073-8{_}3008{_}He _rambles_ if he wanders about, with no definite aim or toward no definite goal.
10073-8{_}3009{_}He _meanders_ if he proceeds slowly and perhaps listlessly in an ever-changing course, as if he were following the windings of the crooked Phrygian river, Meander.
10073-8{_}3010{_}He _promenades_ if he walks in a public place, as for pleasure or display.
10073-8{_}3011{_}He _prowls_ if he moves about softly and stealthily, as in search of prey or booty.
10073-8{_}3012{_}He _hobbles_ if he jerks along unevenly, as from a stiff or crippled condition of body.
10073-8{_}3013{_}He _limps_ if he walks lamely.
10073-8{_}3014{_}He _perambulates_ when he walks through, perhaps for observation or inspection.
10073-8{_}3015{_}_(Perambulates is_ of course a learned word.)
10073-8{_}3016{_}_Assignment for further discrimination_: <sneak, shamble, amble, wander, stamp, slouch, gad, gallivant, glide, hike>.

10073-8{_}3047{_}We should say she _giggles_.
10073-8{_}3048{_}Suppose a youngster is amused at an inappropriate moment and but partly suppresses his laughter; or suppose he wilfully permits the breaking forth of just enough laughter to indicate disrespect.
10073-8{_}3049{_}He _snickers_.
10073-8{_}3050{_}Suppose a person gives a little, light laugh; or more especially, suppose a crowd gives such an one as the result of slight, simultaneous amusement.
10073-8{_}3051{_}Our word now is _titters_.
10073-8{_}3052{_}Suppose we laugh low or gently or to ourselves.
10073-8{_}3053{_}We _chuckle_.
10073-8{_}3054{_}Suppose some one laughs loudly, boisterously, even coarsely, in a manner befitting a lumber camp rather than a drawing room.
10073-8{_}3055{_}That person _guffaws_.
10073-8{_}3056{_}Suppose a man engages in explosive and immoderate laughter.
10073-8{_}3057{_}He _cachinnates_.
10073-8{_}3058{_}_Assignment for further discrimination_: <chortle, roar>.

10073-8{_}3074{_}He _looks_.
10073-8{_}3075{_}But eyes may speak, we are told, and since this person undergoes many changes of mood and purpose, we shall let his eyes tell us all they will about his different manners of looking.
10073-8{_}3076{_}At first he but looks momentarily (as from lack of time) or casually (as from lack of interest).
10073-8{_}3077{_}He _glances_.
10073-8{_}3078{_}Soon he makes a business of looking, and fastens his eyes for a long time on something he admires or wonders at.
10073-8{_}3079{_}He _gazes_.
10073-8{_}3080{_}Presently he looks with a blank, perhaps a rude, expression and with eyes opened widely; he may be for the moment overcome with incomprehension, surprise, or fright, or perhaps he wishes to be insolent.
10073-8{_}3081{_}He _stares_.
10073-8{_}3082{_}Now he is looking narrowly or closely at something that he sees with difficulty.
10073-8{_}3083{_}He _peers_.
10073-8{_}3084{_}The next moment he looks over something with care or with an encompassing sweep of vision.
10073-8{_}3085{_}He _scans_ it.
10073-8{_}3086{_}His interest thoroughly enlisted, he looks at it carefully point by point to see that it is right in each detail.
10073-8{_}3087{_}He _scrutinizes_ it.
10073-8{_}3088{_}He then alters his mood, and looks with scornful or malignant satisfaction upon something he has conquered or has power over.
10073-8{_}3089{_}He _gloats_.
10073-8{_}3090{_}Anger, perhaps fierceness, takes possession of him, and he looks with piercing eyes.
10073-8{_}3091{_}He _glares_.
10073-8{_}3092{_}Threat mingles with anger, and in all likelihood he looks scowlingly or frowningly.

10073-8{_}3097{_}He _peeks_.

10073-8{_}3102{_}He looks at something a long time to study it.
10073-8{_}3103{_}He _cons_ or _pores_.
10073-8{_}3104{_}His study is not of the thing itself; it is meditation or reverie.
10073-8{_}3105{_}He _pores_.
10073-8{_}3106{_}A member of the opposite sex is present; he looks at her with the effort of a flirt to attract attention to himself, or less scrupulous, he directs toward her amorous or inviting glances.
10073-8{_}3107{_}He _ogles_.
10073-8{_}3108{_}_Assignment for further discrimination_: <leer, view, survey, inspect, regard, watch, contemplate>.

10073-8{_}3120{_}The newcomer ____ insolently at his host and ____ the young ladies.
10073-8{_}3121{_}<Abandon, desert, forsake.>  _Abandon_ denotes absolute giving up, as from force of circumstances or shirking of responsibility.
10073-8{_}3122{_}_Desert_ refers to leaving or quitting in violation of obligation, duty, or oath.

10073-8{_}3130{_}We ____ our attempt to save the ship.
10073-8{_}3131{_}<Abase, debase, degrade, humble, humiliate, disgrace.>  To _abase_ is to bring down so that the victim feels himself lowered in estate or external condition.
10073-8{_}3132{_}To _debase_ is to produce a marked decline in actual worth or in moral quality.
10073-8{_}3133{_}To _degrade_ is to lower in rank or status.
10073-8{_}3134{_}To _humble_ is to lower in dignity or self-esteem, or as used reflexively, to restrain one's own pride; the word often implies that the person has been over-proud or arrogant.

10073-8{_}3136{_}To _disgrace_ is to bring actual shame upon.

10073-8{_}3143{_}The conversion of so much bullion into money had ____ the coinage.
10073-8{_}3144{_}<Answer, reply, response, rejoinder, retort, repartee.>  An interesting thing about the _answer_ group is that the generic term has a somewhat strong rival in _reply_, itself fairly inclusive.
10073-8{_}3145{_}We must therefore discriminate rather fully between _answer_ and _reply_.
10073-8{_}3146{_}The former is a return in words to a question, a communication, or an argument.
10073-8{_}3147{_}The latter suggests a more or less formal answer, as one carefully prepared or intelligently thought out.
10073-8{_}3148{_}We might give an _answer_ offhand, but are less likely to give a _reply_ so.
10073-8{_}3149{_}We may give any kind of _answer_ to a question, but if we give a _reply_, the implication is that we have answered it definitely, perhaps satisfactorily.
10073-8{_}3150{_}On the other hand, in controversial matters we may, though we by no means always do, imply a more conclusive meeting of objections through _answer_ than through _reply_.
10073-8{_}3151{_}A _response_ is an expected answer, one in harmony with the question or assertion, or in some way carrying the thought farther.
10073-8{_}3152{_}A _rejoinder_ is a quick reply to something controversial or calling forth opposition.
10073-8{_}3153{_}A _retort_ is a short, sharp reply, such as turns back censure or derision, or as springs from anger.
10073-8{_}3154{_}A _repartee_ is an immediate and witty reply, perhaps to a remark of similar character which it is intended to surpass in cleverness.
10073-8{_}3155{_}_Sentences_: The detailed ____ to our letter should reach us within a week.
10073-8{_}3156{_}The plays of Oscar Wilde abound in brilliant ____.

10073-8{_}3166{_}<Ask, inquire, question, interrogate, interpellate, query, quiz, catechize, request, beg, solicit, entreat, beseech, crave, implore, supplicate, importune, petition.>  From the general tree of asking grow many branches, different in size, in the direction they take, in the shades of meaning they cast.
10073-8{_}3167{_}What can we learn from a rapid scrutiny of each?
10073-8{_}3168{_}That to _inquire_ is to ask for specific information.
10073-8{_}3169{_}That to _question_ is to keep asking in order to obtain detailed or reluctantly given information.
10073-8{_}3170{_}That to _interrogate_ is to question formally, systematically, or thoroughly.
10073-8{_}3171{_}That to _interpellate_ is to question as of unchallenged right, as in a deliberative body.
10073-8{_}3172{_}That to _query_ is to bring a thing into question because of doubt as to its correctness or truth.
10073-8{_}3173{_}That to _quiz_is to question closely and persistently, as from meddlesomeness, opposition, or curiosity.

10073-8{_}3182{_}That to _supplicate_ is to ask with urgent or even desperate appeal.
10073-8{_}3183{_}(Both _implore_ and _supplicate_ imply humility, as of a prayer to a superior being.)
10073-8{_}3184{_}That to _importune_ is to ask for persistently, even wearyingly.
10073-8{_}3185{_}That to _petition_ is to ask a superior, usually in writing, for some favor, grant, or right.
10073-8{_}3186{_}_Assignment for further discrimination_: <plead, pray>.

10073-8{_}3229{_}But a good many people are exhibiting this very devotion.

10073-8{_}3243{_}<Concise, terse, succinct, compendious, compact, sententious, pithy, laconic, curt.>  Words descriptive of brief utterance are, in nearly every instance, in their origin figurative.
10073-8{_}3244{_}The brevity is brought out by comparison with something that is noticeably short or small.
10073-8{_}3245{_}Let us examine the words of our list for their figurative qualities.

10073-8{_}3267{_}Its employment is often legal--the death proves to be of sufficient importance for the law (and the lawyers) to take notice.
10073-8{_}3268{_}_Demise_, however, is outwardly the most resplendent term of all.
10073-8{_}3269{_}It implies that the victim cut a wide swath even in death.

10073-8{_}3298{_}Of these terms the simple, inclusive one is of course _face_ itself.

10073-8{_}4565{_}_Matrimony_--the high sea for which no compass has yet been invented.
10073-8{_}4566{_}_Wedlock's_ a lane where there is no turning.

10073-8{_}4570{_}The quality of _mercy_ is not strain'd,   It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven   Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;   It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;        *       *       *       *       *   And earthly power doth then show likest God's   When _mercy_ seasons justice.

10073-8{_}4591{_}_Poverty_ is dishonorable, not in itself, but when it is a proof of laziness, intemperance, luxury, and carelessness; whereas in a person that is temperate, industrious, just and valiant, and who uses all his virtues for the public good, it shows a great and lofty mind.
10073-8{_}4592{_}_Want_ is a bitter and hateful good,   Because its virtues are not understood;   Yet many things, impossible to thought,   Have been by _need_ to full perfection brought.

10073-8{_}4594{_}O!

10073-8{_}4597{_}It is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their _indigence_ from the rest.
10073-8{_}4598{_}Chill _penury_ repress'd their noble rage,   And froze the genial current of the soul.
10073-8{_}4599{_}Chill _penury_ weighs down the heart itself; and though it sometimes be endured with calmness, it is but the calmness of despair.

10073-8{_}4606{_}To err is human; but _contrition_ felt for the crime distinguishes the virtuous from the wicked.

10073-8{_}4614{_}He then dissolved Parliament, and sent its most _refractory_ members to the Tower.

10073-8{_}4937{_}In Chapter VIII you were given lists of synonyms and made the distinctions yourself.
10073-8{_}4938{_}Near the close of Chapter VIII you were given words and discovered for yourself what their synonyms are.
10073-8{_}4939{_}This third stage might seem to reveal to you the full joys and benefits of your researches in this subject.
10073-8{_}4940{_}Certainly to find a new word for an old one is an exhilarating sort of mental travel.
10073-8{_}4941{_}And to find a new word which expresses exactly what an old one expressed but approximately is a real acquisition in living.
10073-8{_}4942{_}But you are not yet a perfectly trained hunter of synonyms.
10073-8{_}4943{_}Some miscellaneous tasks remain; they will involve hard work and call your utmost powers into play.
10073-8{_}4944{_}Of these tasks the most important is connected with the hint already given that many words, especially if they be generic words, have two or more entirely different meanings.
10073-8{_}4945{_}Let us first establish this fact, and afterwards see what bearing it has on our study of synonyms.
10073-8{_}4946{_}My friend says, "I hope you will have a good day."
10073-8{_}4947{_}Does he mean an enjoyable one in general?
10073-8{_}4948{_}a profitable or lucrative one, in case I have business in hand?
10073-8{_}4949{_}a successful one, if I am selling stocks or buying a house?
10073-8{_}4950{_}Possibly he means a sunshiny day if I intend to play golf, a snowy day if I plan to go hunting, a rainy day if my crops are drying up.
10073-8{_}4951{_}The ideas here are varied, even contradictory, enough; yet _good_ may be used of every one of them.
10073-8{_}4952{_}_Good_ is in truth so general a term that we must know the attendant circumstances if we are to attach to it a signification even approximately accurate.
10073-8{_}4953{_}This does not at all imply that _good is_ a term we may brand as useless.
10073-8{_}4954{_}It implies merely that when our meaning is specific we must set _good_ aside (unless circumstances make its sense unmistakable) in favor of a specific word.
10073-8{_}4955{_}_Things is_ another very general term.
10073-8{_}4956{_}In "Let us wash up the things" it likely means dishes or clothes.
10073-8{_}4957{_}In "Hang your things in the closet" it likely means clothes.
10073-8{_}4958{_}In "Put the things in the tool-box" it likely means tools.
10073-8{_}4959{_}In "Put the things in the sewing-basket" it likely means thread, needles, and scissors.
10073-8{_}4960{_}In "The trenches are swarming with these things" it likely means cooties.
10073-8{_}4961{_}A more accurate word is usually desirable.
10073-8{_}4962{_}Yet we may see the value of the generality in the saying "A place for everything, and everything in its place."
10073-8{_}4963{_}_Good_ and _things_ are not alone in having multitudinous meanings.
10073-8{_}4964{_}There are in the language numerous many-sided words.
10073-8{_}4965{_}These words should be studied carefully.
10073-8{_}4966{_}True, they are not always employed in ambiguous ways.
10073-8{_}4967{_}For example, _right_ in the sense of correct is seldom likely to be mistaken for _right_ in the sense of not-left, but a reader or hearer may frequently mistake it for _right_ in the sense of just or of honorable.
10073-8{_}4968{_}In the use of such words, therefore, we cannot become too discriminating.
10073-8{_}4969{_}EXERCISE H  This exercise concerns itself with common words that have more than one meaning.
10073-8{_}4970{_}Make your procedure as follows.
10073-8{_}4971{_}First, look up the word itself.
10073-8{_}4972{_}Under it you will find a number of defining words.
10073-8{_}4973{_}Then look up each of these in turn, until you have the requisite number and kind of synonyms.
10073-8{_}4974{_}(The word is sure to have more synonyms than are called for.)
10073-8{_}4975{_}You will have to use your dictionary tirelessly.
10073-8{_}4976{_}<Bare.> Find three synonyms for _bare_ as applied to the body; three for it as applied to a room.
10073-8{_}4977{_}<Bear.> Give three other words that might be used instead of _bear_ in the sentence "The pillar bears a heavy weight"; three in the sentence "He bore a heavy load on his back"; three in the sentence "He bore the punishment that was unjustly meted out to him"; three in the sentence "He bore a grudge against his neighbor"; two in the sentence "The field did not bear a crop last year."
10073-8{_}4978{_}<Bold.> Give ten synonyms for _bold_ as applied to a warrior; ten as applied to a young girl.
10073-8{_}4979{_}Observe that the synonyms in the first list are favorable in import and suggest the idea of bravery, whereas those in the second list are unfavorable and suggest the idea of brazenness.
10073-8{_}4980{_}How do you account for this fact?
10073-8{_}4981{_}Can you think of circumstances in which a young girl might be so placed that the favorable synonyms might be applied to her?
10073-8{_}4982{_}<Bright.> Give as many words as you can, at least twelve, that can be used instead of _bright_ as applied to a light, a diamond, a wet pavement, or a live coal.

10073-8{_}4996{_}Substitute four words for _firm_ in the sentence "I made the board firm by nailing it to the wall"; three in the sentence "The water froze into a firm mass"; five in the sentence "He was firm in his determination to proceed."
10073-8{_}4997{_}<Flat>.
10073-8{_}4998{_}Instead of _flat_ use in turn four other words in the sentence "This is a flat piece of ground"; five in the sentence "It was as flat a story as ever wearied company"; three in the sentence "The cook having forgotten the salt, the soup was flat"; four in the sentence "I am surprised by your flat refusal."
10073-8{_}4999{_}<Free>.
10073-8{_}5000{_}_Free_ may be applied to a person not subject to a tax or a disease, to a person who has been released from confinement or restraint, to a person who is not reserved or formal in his relations to others, to a person who is willing to give.
10073-8{_}5001{_}Out of your own resources substitute as many words as you can for _free_ in each of these sentences.

10073-8{_}5058{_}Note whether a knowledge of the attendant circumstances is necessary to an understanding of the original word, to an understanding of the word substituted for it.

10073-8{_}5060{_}Then for it in each of these applications assemble as many synonyms as you can unaided.
10073-8{_}5061{_}Finally, have recourse to a dictionary or book of synonyms for the further extension of your lists.
10073-8{_}5062{_}(By way of illustration, let us take the word _quiet_.
10073-8{_}5063{_}Through meditation and analysis we discover that it may be applied (a) to water or any liquid not in motion, (b) to a place that is without sound, (c) to a place shut off from activity or bustle, (d) to a person who is not demonstrative or forward in manner.
10073-8{_}5064{_}We then think of all the words we can that can be substituted for it in each of these uses.
10073-8{_}5065{_}No matter how incompletely or unsatisfactorily we feel we are performing this task, we must not give it over until we have found every word we can summon.
10073-8{_}5066{_}Then we turn to a dictionary or book of synonyms.
10073-8{_}5067{_}Thus for _quiet_ we shall assemble such synonyms as (a) calm, still, motionless, placid, tranquil, serene, smooth, unruffled, undisturbed, pacific, stagnant; (b) silent, still, noiseless, mute, hushed, voiceless; (c) secluded, sequestered, solitary, isolated, unfrequented, unvisited, peaceful, untrodden, retired; (d) demure, sedate, staid, reserved, meek, gentle, retiring, unobtrusive, modest, unassuming, timid, shrinking, shy.)
10073-8{_}5068{_}Barren       Keep                Pure         Solid Certain      Liberal             Rare         Sorry Cold         Light (adjective)   Rich         Spread Cool         Light (noun)        Right        Straight Deep         Long                Rude         Still Dry          Low                 Short        Sure Easy         Mean                Simple       Thick Foul         Narrow              Slow         Thin Full         New                 Small        Tender Gentle       Obscure             Smooth       True Grand        Odd                 Sober        Warm Heavy        Particular          Soft         Yield Keen   <Literal vs. Figurative Applications>  One of the most interesting things to watch in the study of words is their development from a literal to a figurative application.
10073-8{_}5069{_}The first man who broke away from the confines of the literal meaning of a word and applied the word to something that only in a figurative sense had qualities analogous to the original meaning, was creating poetry.
10073-8{_}5070{_}He was making an imaginative flight comparable in daring to the Wright brothers' first aeronautic flight.
10073-8{_}5071{_}But as the word was used over and over in this figurative way the imaginative flight became more and more commonplace.
10073-8{_}5072{_}At last it ceased to be imaginative at all; through frequent repetition it had settled into the matter of course.
10073-8{_}5073{_}A glance back at the _Concise_ group above will show you that with time the comparison which was once the basis and the life of the figurative use of words is dulled, obscured, even lost.
10073-8{_}5074{_}As a further enforcement of this fact, let us analyze the word _rough_.
10073-8{_}5075{_}In its literal application, it may designate any surface that has ridges, projections, or inequalities and is therefore uneven, jagged, rugged, scraggy, or scabrous.
10073-8{_}5076{_}Now frequently a man's face or head is rough because unshaved or uncombed; also the fur of an animal is rough.
10073-8{_}5077{_}Hence the term could be used for unkempt, disheveled, shaggy, hairy, coarse, bristly.
10073-8{_}5078{_}"The child ran its hand over its father's rough cheek" and "The bear had a rough coat" are sentences that even the most unimaginative mind can understand.
10073-8{_}5079{_}We speak of rough timber because its surface has not been planed or made smooth.
10073-8{_}5080{_}We speak of a rough diamond because it is unpolished, uncut.
10073-8{_}5081{_}Note that all these uses are literal, that in each instance some unevenness of surface is referred to.
10073-8{_}5082{_}But man, urged on by the desire to say what he means with more novelty, strikingness, or force, applied the word to ideas that have no surfaces to be uneven.
10073-8{_}5083{_}He imagined what these ideas would be like if they had surfaces.
10073-8{_}5084{_}Of course in putting these conceptions into language he was creating figures of speech, some of them startlingly apt, some of them merely far-fetched.
10073-8{_}5085{_}He said a man had a _rough_ voice, as though the voice were like a cactus in its prickly irregularities.
10073-8{_}5086{_}By _rough_ he meant what his fellows meant when they spoke of the voice as harsh, grating, jarring, discordant, inharmonious, strident, raucous, or unmusical.
10073-8{_}5087{_}Going farther, that early poet said the weather was _rough_.
10073-8{_}5088{_}He thought of clement weather as being smooth and even, but of inclement, severe, stormy, tempestuous, or violent weather as being full of projections to rend and harass one.
10073-8{_}5089{_}Thus an everyday use of the term today was once wrenched and immoderate speech.
10073-8{_}5090{_}Possibly the first man who heard of rough weather was puzzled for a moment, then amused or delighted as he caught the figure.
10073-8{_}5091{_}It did not require great originality to think of a crowd as _rough_ in its movements.
10073-8{_}5092{_}But our poet applied the idea to an individual.
10073-8{_}5093{_}To him a rude, uncivil, impolite, ungracious, uncourteous, unpolished, uncouth, boorish, blunt, bluff, gruff, brusk, or burly person was as the unplaned lumber or the unpolished gem; and we imitative moderns still call such a man _rough_.
10073-8{_}5094{_}But we do not think of the man as covered with projections that need to be taken off, unless forsooth we receive _rough_ treatment at his hands.
10073-8{_}5095{_}And note how far we have journeyed from the original idea of the word when we say "I gave the report a _rough_ glance," meaning cursory, hasty, superficial, or incomplete consideration.
10073-8{_}5096{_}Many very simple words, including several of those already treated in this chapter, are two-sided in that they are both literal and figurative.
10073-8{_}5097{_}EXERCISE L  Trace each of the following words from its literal to its figurative applications, giving synonyms for each of its uses.
10073-8{_}5098{_}Open        Bright      Stiff       Hard Low         Cool        Sharp       Flat Keen        Strong      Dull        Raw Small       Odd         Warm        Deep Eccentric   <Imperfectly Understood Facts and Ideas>  Thus far in this chapter we have been considering many-sided words.
10073-8{_}5099{_}We must now turn to a certain class of facts and ideas that deserve better understanding and closer analysis than we usually accord them.
10073-8{_}5100{_}These facts and ideas are supposed to be matters of common knowledge.
10073-8{_}5101{_}And in their broad scope and purport they are.
10073-8{_}5102{_}Because acquaintance with them is taken for granted it behooves us to know them.
10073-8{_}5103{_}Yet they are in reality complicated, and when we attempt to deal with them in detail, our assurance forsakes us.
10073-8{_}5104{_}All of us have our "blind sides" intellectually-- quake to have certain areas of discussion entered, because we foresee that we must sit idly by without power to make sensible comment.
10073-8{_}5105{_}Unto as many as possible of these blind sides of ourselves we should pronounce the blessed words, "Let there be light."
10073-8{_}5106{_}We have therefore to consider certain matters and topics which are supposed to belong to the common currency of social information, but with which our familiarity is less thoroughgoing than it should be.
10073-8{_}5107{_}What are these facts and topics?
10073-8{_}5108{_}Take for illustration the subject of aeronautics.
10073-8{_}5109{_}Suppose we have but the vaguest conception of the part played or likely to be played by aircraft in war, commerce, and pleasure.
10073-8{_}5110{_}Suppose we are not aware that some craft are made to float and others to be driven by propellers.
10073-8{_}5111{_}Suppose such terms as Zeppelin, blimp, monoplane, biplane, hydroplane, dirigible have no definite import for us.
10073-8{_}5112{_}Does not our knowledge fall short of that expected of well-informed men in this present age?
10073-8{_}5113{_}Or take military terms.
10073-8{_}5114{_}Everybody uses them--clergymen, pacifists, clubmen, social reformers, novelists, tramps, brick-layers, Big-Stickers.
10073-8{_}5115{_}We cannot escape them if we would.
10073-8{_}5116{_}We ourselves use them.
10073-8{_}5117{_}But do we use them with precise and masterly understanding?
10073-8{_}5118{_}You call one civilian colonel and another major; which have you paid the higher compliment?
10073-8{_}5119{_}You are uncertain whether a given officer is a colonel or a major, and you wish to address him in such fashion as will least offend his sensitiveness as to rank and nomenclature; which title--colonel or major--is the less perilous?
10073-8{_}5120{_}You are told that a major has command of a battalion; does that tell you anything about him?
10073-8{_}5121{_}You are told that he has command of a squadron, of a brigade, of a platoon; do these changes in circumstances have any import for you?
10073-8{_}5122{_}If not, you have too faltering a grasp upon military facts and terminology.
10073-8{_}5123{_}The best remedy for such shortcomings is to be insatiably curious on all subjects.
10073-8{_}5124{_}This of course is the ideal; nobody ever fully attains it.
10073-8{_}5125{_}Nevertheless Exercise M will set you to groping into certain broad matters relevant to ordinary needs.
10073-8{_}5126{_}Thereafter, if your purpose be strong enough, you will carry the same methods there acquired into other fields of knowledge.
10073-8{_}5127{_}You may object that all this is as much mental as linguistic--that what is proposed will result in as large accessions of general information as of vocabulary.
10073-8{_}5128{_}Let this be admitted.
10073-8{_}5129{_}Deficiencies of language are often, perhaps almost invariably, linked with deficiencies of knowledge.
10073-8{_}5130{_}To repair the one we must at the same time repair the other.
10073-8{_}5131{_}This may seem a hard saying to those who seek, or would impart, mere glibness of phrase without regard for the substance--who worship "words, words, words" without thought of "the matter."
10073-8{_}5132{_}There is such a thing as froth of utterance, but who has respect therefor or is deceived thereby?
10073-8{_}5133{_}Speech that is not informed is like a house without a foundation.
10073-8{_}5134{_}You should not desire to possess it.
10073-8{_}5135{_}Abroad in this world of ours already are too many people who darken counsel by words without knowledge.
10073-8{_}5136{_}EXERCISE M  A second lieutenant is the commissioned officer of lowest grade in the United States army.

10073-8{_}5157{_}Make as long a list as possible (up to thirty) of words that appeal to the sense of sight (especially color words and motion words), to the sense of hearing, of smell, of taste, of touch.

10073-8{_}5159{_}Name all the terms you can associated with law, with medicine, with geology.
10073-8{_}5160{_}Name the planets, the signs of the zodiac, as many constellations as you can.
10073-8{_}5161{_}Name the seven colors of the spectrum, and for each name give all the synonyms you can.
10073-8{_}5162{_}What are the primary colors?
10073-8{_}5163{_}the secondary colors?
10073-8{_}5164{_}Give the various races into which mankind has been divided, and the color of each.
10073-8{_}5165{_}Name every kind of tree you can think of, every kind of flower, every kind of animal, every kind of bird.
10073-8{_}5166{_}X      SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF WORDS   You have already mastered many words, but a glance at any page of the dictionary will convince you that you have not mastered all.
10073-8{_}5167{_}Nor will you, ever.
10073-8{_}5168{_}Their number is too great, and too many of them are abstrusely technical.
10073-8{_}5169{_}Nevertheless there remain many words that you should bring into your vocabulary.
10073-8{_}5170{_}Most of them are not extremely usual; on the other hand they are not so unusual that you would encounter them but once in a lifetime.
10073-8{_}5171{_}The majority of them are familiar to you, perhaps; that is, you will have a general feeling that you have seen them before.
10073-8{_}5172{_}But this is not enough.
10073-8{_}5173{_}Do you know exactly what they mean?
10073-8{_}5174{_}Can you, when the occasion comes, use them?-use them promptly and well?
10073-8{_}5175{_}This is the test.
10073-8{_}5176{_}Many of the words are absolutely new so far as this book is concerned.
10073-8{_}5177{_}They have not been discussed or attached to any list.
10073-8{_}5178{_}Many are not entirely new.
10073-8{_}5179{_}They have appeared, but not received such emphasis that they are sure to stand fast in your memory.
10073-8{_}5180{_}Or some cognate form of them may have been mastered, yet they themselves may remain unknown.
10073-8{_}5181{_}Thus you may know _commendation_ but not _commendatory, credulous_ but not _incredulity, invalid_ but not _invalidate_ or _invalidity_.
10073-8{_}5182{_}One of the best of all ways to extend your vocabulary is to make each word of your acquaintance introduce you to its immediate kinsmen, those grouped with it on the same page of the dictionary.
10073-8{_}5183{_}This chapter puts you on your mettle.
10073-8{_}5184{_}Hitherto you have been given instructions as to the way to proceed, Now you must shift for yourself.
10073-8{_}5185{_}The words, to be sure, are corraled for you.
10073-8{_}5186{_}But you must tame them and break them, in order that on them you may ride the ranges of human intercourse.
10073-8{_}5187{_}If you have not yet learned how to subdue them to your will and use, it would be futile to tell you how.
10073-8{_}5188{_}You have been put in the way of mastering words.
10073-8{_}5189{_}The task that henceforth confronts you is your own.
10073-8{_}5190{_}You must have at it unaided.
10073-8{_}5191{_}It is true that, in the exercise that follows, specific help is given you on a limited number of the words.
10073-8{_}5192{_}But this help is only toward discovering the words for yourself before you have seen them in a list.
10073-8{_}5193{_}And for most of the words not even this meager assistance is given.
10073-8{_}5194{_}EXERCISE - Supplementary  Each of the following groups of words is preceded by sentences in which blanks should be filled by words from that group.
10073-8{_}5195{_}But do your best to fill these blanks properly before you consult the group at all.
10073-8{_}5196{_}You must learn to think of, or think up, the right word instead of having it pointed out to you.

10073-8{_}5275{_}XI      RETROSPECT   DO you never, while occupying a dental chair and deploring the necessity that drives you to that uncomfortable seat, admire the skill of the dentist in the use of his instruments?
10073-8{_}5276{_}A great many of these instruments lie at his hand.
10073-8{_}5277{_}To you they appear bewildering, so slightly different are they from each other.
10073-8{_}5278{_}Yet with unerring readiness the dentist lays hold of the one he needs.
10073-8{_}5279{_}Now this facility of his is not a blessing with which a gracious heaven endowed him.
10073-8{_}5280{_}It is the consequence and reward of hard study, and above all of work, hard work.
10073-8{_}5281{_}You have been ambitious of like skill in the manipulation of words.
10073-8{_}5282{_}Had you not been, you would never have undertaken this study.
10073-8{_}5283{_}You have perceived that when you speak or write, words are your instruments.
10073-8{_}5284{_}You have wished to learn how to use them.
10073-8{_}5285{_}Now for every idea you shall ever have occasion to express await throngs of vocables, each presenting its claims as a fit medium.
10073-8{_}5286{_}These you must pass in instantaneous review, these you must expertly appraise, out of these you must choose the words that will best serve your purpose.
10073-8{_}5287{_}With practice, you will make your selections unconsciously.
10073-8{_}5288{_}You will never, of course, quite attain the infallibility of the dentist; for linguistic instruments are more numerous than dental, and far more complex.
10073-8{_}5289{_}But you will more and more nearly approximate the ideal, will more and more nearly find that right expression has become second nature with you.
10073-8{_}5290{_}All this is conditioned upon labor faithful and steadfast.
10073-8{_}5291{_}Without labor you will never be adept.
10073-8{_}5292{_}At the outset of our study together we warned you that, though we should gather the material and point the way, you yourself must do the work.
10073-8{_}5293{_}This book is not one to glance through.
10073-8{_}5294{_}It is one to dwell with, to toil with.
10073-8{_}5295{_}It exacts much of you-makes you, for each page you turn, pay with the sweat of your brain.
10073-8{_}5296{_}But, assuming that you have done your part, what have you gained?
10073-8{_}5297{_}Without answering this question at all fully, we may at this juncture engage in a brief retrospect.
10073-8{_}5298{_}First of all, you have rid yourself of the notion that words are dead things, unrealities worthy of no more than wooden and mechanical employment.
10073-8{_}5299{_}As much as anything else in the world, words are alive and responsive, are fraught with unmeasured possibilities of good or ill. You have taken due cognizance of the fact that words must be considered in the aggregate as well as individually, and have reckoned with the pitfalls and dangers as well as with the advantages of their use in combination.
10073-8{_}5300{_}But the basis of everything is a keener knowledge of words severally.
10073-8{_}5301{_}You have therefore come to study words with the zest and insight you exhibit (or should exhibit) in studying men.
10073-8{_}5302{_}Incidentally, you have acquired the habit of looking up dictionary definitions, not merely to satisfy a present need, but also to add permanently to your linguistic resources.
10073-8{_}5303{_}You have carried the study of individuals farther.
10073-8{_}5304{_}You have come to know words inside and out.
10073-8{_}5305{_}Such knowledge not only assists you in your dealings with your contemporaries; it illuminates for you great literature of the past that otherwise would remain obscure.
10073-8{_}5306{_}How much keener, for example, is your understanding of Shakespeare's passage on the Seven Ages of Man because of your thorough acquaintance with the single word _pantaloon_!
10073-8{_}5307{_}How quickly does the awe for big words slip from you when you perceive that _precocious is_ in origin the equivalent of _half-baked!_ What intimacy of insight into words you feel when you find that a _companion is_ a _sharer of one's bread_!
10073-8{_}5308{_}What a linking of language with life you discover when you learn the original signification of _presently_, of _idiot_, of _rival_, of _sandwich_, of _pocket handkerchief_!
10073-8{_}5309{_}And what revelations as into a mystic fraternalism with words do you obtain when you confront such a phrase as "the bank _teller_" or "cut to the _quick"!
10073-8{_}5310{_}_Not only have words become more like living beings to you; you have learned to think of them in relations analogous to the human.
10073-8{_}5311{_}You can detect the blood kinship, for example, between _prescribe_ and _manuscript_, and know that the strain of _fact_ or fie or fy in a word is pretty sure to betoken making or doing.
10073-8{_}5312{_}You know that there are elaborate intermarriages among words.
10073-8{_}5313{_}You recognize _phonograph_, for example, as a married couple; you even have confidential word as to the dowry brought by each of the contracting parties to the new verbal household.
10073-8{_}5314{_}You have discovered, further, that the language actually swarms with "pairs"--words joined with each other not in blood or by marriage but through meaning.
10073-8{_}5315{_}You have so familiarized yourself with hundreds of these pairs that to think of one word is to call the other to mind.
10073-8{_}5316{_}Finally, and in many respects most important of all, you have acquired a vast stock of synonyms.
10073-8{_}5317{_}You have had it brought to your attention that the number of basic ideas in the world is surprisingly small; that for each of these ideas there is in our language one generic word; that most people use this one word constantly instead of seeking the subsidiary term that expresses a particular phase of the idea; and that you as a builder of your vocabulary must, while holding fast to the basic idea with one hand, reach out with the other for the fit, sure material of specific words.
10073-8{_}5318{_}Nor have you rested in the mere perception of theory.
10073-8{_}5319{_}You have had abundant practice, have yourself covered the ground foot by foot.
10073-8{_}5320{_}You can therefore proceed with reasonable freedom from the commoner ideas of the human mind to that expression of definite aspects of them which is anything but common.
10073-8{_}5321{_}You have not, of course, achieved perfection.
10073-8{_}5322{_}There still is much for you to do.
10073-8{_}5323{_}There always will be.
10073-8{_}5324{_}Nevertheless in the ways just reviewed, and in various other ways not mentioned in this chapter, you have made yourself verbally rich.
10073-8{_}5325{_}You are one of the millionaires of language.
10073-8{_}5326{_}When you speak, it is not with stammering incompetence, but with confident readiness.
10073-8{_}5327{_}When you write, it is with energy and assurance in the very flow of the ink.
10073-8{_}5328{_}Where you had long been a slave, you have become a freeman and can look your fellows in the eye.
10073-8{_}5329{_}You have the best badge of culture a human being can possess.
10073-8{_}5330{_}You have power at your tongue's end.
10073-8{_}5331{_}You have the proud satisfaction of having wrought well, and the inspiration of knowing that whatever verbal need may arise, you are trained and equipped to grapple with it triumphantly.
10073-8{_}5332{_}APPENDICES   _Appendix I_      THE DRIFT OF OUR RURAL POPULATION CITYWARD     (An editorial)  To an individual who from whatever motives of personal advantage or mere curiosity has made himself an observer of current tendencies, the drift of our rural population cityward gives food for serious reflection.
10073-8{_}5333{_}This drift is one of the most pronounced of the social and economic phenomena of the day.
10073-8{_}5334{_}Its consequences upon the life, welfare, and future of the great nation to which we are proud to acknowledge our whole-hearted allegiance are matters of such paramount importance to all concerned that we should turn aside more often than we do from the distracting exactions of our ordinary activities to give them prolonged and earnest consideration.
10073-8{_}5335{_}A generation or so ago human beings were content to spend the full term of their earthly existence amid rural surroundings, or if in their declining days they longed for more of the comforts and associations which are among the cravings of mortality, it was an easy proposition to move to the nearest village or, if they were too high and mighty for this simple measure to satisfy them, they could indulge in the more grandiose performance of residing in the county seat.
10073-8{_}5336{_}But nowadays our people want more.
10073-8{_}5337{_}Rich or poor, tall or dumpy, tottering grandmothers or babies in swaddling-clothes, they long for ampler pastures.
10073-8{_}5338{_}Their brawny arms or hoary heads must bedeck nothing less than the metropolis itself, and perchance put shoulders to the wheel in the incessant grind of the urban treadmill.
10073-8{_}5339{_}Can you beat it?
10073-8{_}5340{_}Unquestioned profit does not attend the migration.
10073-8{_}5341{_}It stands to reason that some of the very advantages sought have been sacrificed on the altar of the drift cityward.
10073-8{_}5342{_}Let us say you have your individual domicile or the cramped and sunless apartment you dub your habitation within corporate limits.
10073-8{_}5343{_}Does that mean that the privileges of the city are at your disposal, so that you have merely to reach forth your hand and pluck them?
10073-8{_}5344{_}Well, hardly!
10073-8{_}5345{_}You certainly do not reside in the downtown section, or if you do, you wish to heaven you didn't.
10073-8{_}5346{_}And you can reach this section only with delay and inconvenience, whether in the hours of business or in the subsequent period devoted to the glitter of nocturnal revelry and amusement.
10073-8{_}5347{_}But whatever the disadvantages of the city, the people who endure them are convinced that to go back to the vines and figtrees of their native heath would be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
10073-8{_}5348{_}Why?
10073-8{_}5349{_}Well, for one thing, there is no such thing as leisure in the areas that lie beyond those vast aggregations of humanity which constitute our cities.
10073-8{_}5350{_}Not only are there innumerable and seemingly interminable chores that must follow the regular occupations of the day, but a thousand emergencies due to chance, weather, or the natural cussedness of things must be disposed of as they arise, regardless of what plans the rustic swain cherishes for the use of his spare time.
10073-8{_}5351{_}Urban laborers have contrived by one means or another to bring about a limitation of the number of hours per diem they are forced to toil.
10073-8{_}5352{_}To the farmers such an alleviation of their hardships is not within the realm of practicability.
10073-8{_}5353{_}They kick about it of course.
10073-8{_}5354{_}They say it's a blooming nuisance.
10073-8{_}5355{_}But neither their heartburnings nor their struggles can efface it as a fact.
10073-8{_}5356{_}Again, the means of entertainment are more limited, and that by a big lot, with the farmer than with those who dwell in the cities.
10073-8{_}5357{_}It is all very well to talk about the blessings of the rural telephone, rural free delivery, and the automobile.
10073-8{_}5358{_}These things do make communication easier than it used to be, but after all they're only a drop in the bucket and do little to stop the drift cityward.
10073-8{_}5359{_}We may remark just here that if you live a thousand miles from nowhere and are willing to drive your Tin Lizzie into town for "the advantages," you aren't likely to get much even along the line of the movies, and you'll get less still if what you're after is an A-1 school for your progeny.
10073-8{_}5360{_}Finally, the widespread impression that the farmer is a bloated and unscrupulous profiteer has done much to disgust him with his station and employment in life.
10073-8{_}5361{_}We don't say he's the one and only when it comes to the virtues.
10073-8{_}5362{_}Maybe he hasn't sprouted any wings yet.
10073-8{_}5363{_}What if he hasn't?
10073-8{_}5364{_}The cities, with their brothels, their big business, and their municipal governments--you wouldn't have the face to say that there's anything wrong with them, now would you?
10073-8{_}5365{_}Oh, no!
10073-8{_}5366{_}Of course not!
10073-8{_}5367{_}The farmer pays high for his machinery and goes clear to the bottom of his pocketbook when he has to buy shoes or a sack of flour, but let him have a steer's hide or a wagon load of wheat to sell, and it's somebody else's ox that's gored.
10073-8{_}5368{_}Consumers pay big prices for farm products, goodness knows, but they don't pay them to the farmer.
10073-8{_}5369{_}Not on your tintype.
10073-8{_}5370{_}The middleman gets his, you needn't question that.
10073-8{_}5371{_}We beg pardon a thousand times.
10073-8{_}5372{_}We mean the middle_men_.
10073-8{_}5373{_}There's no end to those human parasites.
10073-8{_}5374{_}And so farmer after farmer breaks up the old homestead and contributes his mite to the drift cityward.
10073-8{_}5375{_}What will be the result that comes out of it all?
10073-8{_}5376{_}The effect upon the farmer deserves an editorial all to itself.
10073-8{_}5377{_}Here we must limit ourselves to the effects on the future of our beloved American nation.
10073-8{_}5378{_}And even these we can now do no more than mention; we lack space to elaborate them.
10073-8{_}5379{_}One effect, if the tendency continues, will be such a reduction in home-produced foodstuffs that we shall have to import from other countries lying abroad a good portion of the means of our physical sustenance, and shall face such an increase in the cost of the same that thousands and thousands of our people will find it increasingly harder as the years pass by to maintain their relative economic position.
10073-8{_}5380{_}Another effect will be that our civilization, which to this point has sprawled over broad acres, will become an urban civilization, penned in amid conditions, restraints, privations, and perhaps also opportunities unprecedented in our past history and unknown to the experience we have had hitherto.
10073-8{_}5381{_}A final effect will be that our most conservative class, the rural populace, will no longer present resistance that is formidable to the innovations which those who hold extreme views are forever exhorting us to embrace; and the result may well be that the disintegration of this staying and stabilizing element in our citizenship--one that retards and mollifies if it does not inhibit change--will produce consequences in its train which may be as dire as they are difficult to foretell.
10073-8{_}5382{_}_Appendix_ 2      CAUSES FOR THE AMERICAN SPIRIT OF LIBERTY     (From the _Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies_)     By EDMUND BURKE  In this character of the Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole; and as an ardent is always a jealous affection, your Colonies become suspicious, restive, and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force, or shuffle from them by chicane, what they think the only advantage worth living for.
10073-8{_}5383{_}This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English Colonies probably than in any other people of the earth, and this from a great variety of powerful causes; which, to understand the true temper of their minds and the direction which this spirit takes, it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely.
10073-8{_}5384{_}First, the people of the Colonies are descendants of Englishmen.
10073-8{_}5385{_}England, Sir, is a nation which still, I hope, respects, and formerly adored, her freedom.
10073-8{_}5386{_}The Colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character was most predominant; and they took this bias and direction the moment they parted from your hands.
10073-8{_}5387{_}They are therefore not only devoted to liherty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and on English principles.
10073-8{_}5388{_}Abstract liberty, like other mere abstractions, is not to be found.
10073-8{_}5389{_}Liberty inheres in some sensible object; and every nation has formed to itself some favorite point, which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happiness.
10073-8{_}5390{_}It happened, you know, Sir, that the great contests for freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of taxing.
10073-8{_}5391{_}Most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magistrates; or on the balance among the several orders of the state.
10073-8{_}5392{_}The question of money was not with them so immediate.
10073-8{_}5393{_}But in England it was otherwise.
10073-8{_}5394{_}On this point of taxes the ablest pens, and most eloquent tongues, have been exercised; the greatest spirits have acted and suffered.
10073-8{_}5395{_}In order to give the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was not only necessary for those who in argument defended the excellence of the English Constitution to insist on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parchments and blind usages to reside in a certain body called a House of Commons.
10073-8{_}5396{_}They went much farther; they attempted to prove, and they succeeded, that in theory it ought to be so, from the particular nature of a House of Commons as an immediate representative of the people, whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not.
10073-8{_}5397{_}They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves, mediately or immediately, possess the power of granting their own money, or no shadow of liberty can subsist.
10073-8{_}5398{_}The Colonies draw from you, as with their life-blood, these ideas and principles.
10073-8{_}5399{_}Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing.
10073-8{_}5400{_}Liberty might be safe, or might be endangered, in twenty other particulars, without their being much pleased or alarmed.
10073-8{_}5401{_}Here they felt its pulse; and as they found that beat, they thought themselves sick or sound.
10073-8{_}5402{_}I do not say whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own case.
10073-8{_}5403{_}It is not easy, indeed, to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries.
10073-8{_}5404{_}The fact is, that they did thus apply those general arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wisdom or mistake, confirmed them in the imagination that they, as well as you, had an interest in these common principles.
10073-8{_}5405{_}They were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their provincial legislative assemblies.
10073-8{_}5406{_}Their governments are popular in an high degree; some are merely popular; in all, the popular representative is the most weighty; and this share of the people in their ordinary government never fails to inspire them with lofty sentiments, and with a strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance.
10073-8{_}5407{_}If anything were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of government, religion would have given it a complete effect.
10073-8{_}5408{_}Religion, always a principle of energy, in this new people is no way worn out or impaired; and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this free spirit.
10073-8{_}5409{_}The people are Protestants; and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion.
10073-8{_}5410{_}This is a persuasion not only favorable to liberty, but built upon it.
10073-8{_}5411{_}I do not think, Sir, that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in their religious tenets, as in their history.
10073-8{_}5412{_}Every one knows that the Roman Catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them, and received great favor and every kind of support from authority.
10073-8{_}5413{_}The Church of England too was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of regular government.
10073-8{_}5414{_}But the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world, and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty.
10073-8{_}5415{_}Their very existence depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim.
10073-8{_}5416{_}All Protestantism, even the most cold and passive, is a sort of dissent.
10073-8{_}5417{_}But the religion most prevalent in our Northern Colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent, and the protestantism of the Protestant religion.
10073-8{_}5418{_}This religion, under a variety of denominations agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty, is predominant in most of the Northern Provinces, where the Church of England, notwithstanding its legal rights, is in reality no more than a sort of private sect, not composing most probably the tenth of the people.
10073-8{_}5419{_}The Colonists left England when this spirit was high, and in the emigrants was the highest of all; and even that stream of foreigners which has been constantly flowing into these Colonies has, for the greatest part, been composed of dissenters from the establishments of their several countries, who have brought with them a temper and character far from alien to that of the people with whom they mixed.
10073-8{_}5420{_}Sir, I can perceive by their manner that some gentlemen object to the latitude of this description, because in the Southern Colonies the Church of England forms a large body, and has a regular establishment.
10073-8{_}5421{_}It is certainly true.
10073-8{_}5422{_}There is, however, a circumstance attending these Colonies which, in my opinion, fully counterbalances this difference, and makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the northward.
10073-8{_}5423{_}It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves.
10073-8{_}5424{_}Where this is the case in any part of the world, those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom.
10073-8{_}5425{_}Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege.
10073-8{_}5426{_}Not seeing there, that freedom, as in countries where it is a common blessing and as broad and general as the air, may be united with much abject toil, with great misery, with all the exterior of servitude; liberty looks, amongst them, like something that is more noble and liberal.
10073-8{_}5427{_}I do not mean, Sir, to commend the superior morality of this sentiment, which has at least as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man.
10073-8{_}5428{_}The fact is so; and these people of the Southern Colonies are much more strongly, and with an higher and more stubborn spirit, attached to liberty than those to the northward.
10073-8{_}5429{_}Such were all the ancient commonwealths; such were our Gothic ancestors; such in our days were the Poles; and such will be all masters of slaves, who are not slaves themselves.
10073-8{_}5430{_}In such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom, fortifies it, and renders it invincible.
10073-8{_}5431{_}Permit me, Sir, to add another circumstance in our Colonies which contributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable spirit.
10073-8{_}5432{_}I mean their education.
10073-8{_}5433{_}In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study.
10073-8{_}5434{_}The profession itself is numerous and powerful; and in most provinces it takes the lead.
10073-8{_}5435{_}The greater number of the deputies sent to the Congress were lawyers.
10073-8{_}5436{_}But all who read, and most do read, endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science.
10073-8{_}5437{_}I have been told by an eminent bookseller, that in no branch of his business, after tracts of popular devotion, were so many books as those on the law exported to the Plantations.
10073-8{_}5438{_}The Colonists have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own use.
10073-8{_}5439{_}I hear that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone's Commentaries in America as in England.
10073-8{_}5440{_}General Gage marks out this disposition very particularly in a letter on your table.
10073-8{_}5441{_}He states that all the people in his government are lawyers, or smatterers in law; and that in Boston they have been enabled, by successful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal constitutions.
10073-8{_}5442{_}The smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legislature, their obligations to obedience, and the penalties of rebellion.
10073-8{_}5443{_}All this is mighty well.
10073-8{_}5444{_}But my honorable and learned friend on the floor, who condescends to mark what I say for animadversion, will disdain that ground.
10073-8{_}5445{_}He has heard, as well as I, that when great honors and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the service of the state, it is a formidable adversary to government.
10073-8{_}5446{_}If the spirit be not tamed and broken by these happy methods, it is stubborn and litigious.
10073-8{_}5447{_}_Abeunt studia in mores_.
10073-8{_}5448{_}This study renders men acute, inquisitive, dexterous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of resources.
10073-8{_}5449{_}In other countries, the people, more simple, and of a less mercurial cast, judge of an ill principle in government only by an actual grievance; here they anticipate the evil, and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle.
10073-8{_}5450{_}They augur misgovernment at a distance, and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze.
10073-8{_}5451{_}The last cause of this disobedient spirit in the Colonies is hardly less powerful than the rest, as it is not merely moral, but laid deep in the natural constitution of things.
10073-8{_}5452{_}Three thousand miles of ocean lie between you and them.
10073-8{_}5453{_}No contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in weakening government.
10073-8{_}5454{_}Seas roll, and months pass, between the order and the execution; and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat a whole system.
10073-8{_}5455{_}You have, indeed, winged ministers of vengeance, who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of the sea.
10073-8{_}5456{_}But there a power steps in that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements, and says, _So far shalt thou go, and no farther_.
10073-8{_}5457{_}Who are you, that you should fret and rage, and bite the chains of nature?
10073-8{_}5458{_}Nothing worse happens to you than does to all nations who have extensive empire; and it happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown.
10073-8{_}5459{_}In large bodies the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremities.
10073-8{_}5460{_}Nature has said it.
10073-8{_}5461{_}The Turk cannot govern Egypt and Arabia and Kurdistan as he governs Thrace; nor has he the same dominion in Crimea and Algiers which he has at Brusa and Smyrna.
10073-8{_}5462{_}Despotism itself is obliged to truck and huckster.
10073-8{_}5463{_}The Sultan gets such obedience as he can.
10073-8{_}5464{_}He governs with a loose rein, that he may govern at all; and the whole of the force and vigor of his authority in his center is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders.
10073-8{_}5465{_}Spain, in her provinces, is, perhaps, not so well obeyed as you are in yours.
10073-8{_}5466{_}She complies, too; she submits; she watches times.
10073-8{_}5467{_}This is the immutable condition, the eternal law of extensive and detached empire.
10073-8{_}5468{_}Then, Sir, from these six capital sources--of descent, of form of government, of religion in the Northern Provinces, of manners in the Southern, of education, of the remoteness of situation from the first mover of government-from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty has grown up.
10073-8{_}5469{_}It has grown with the growth of the people in your Colonies, and increased with the increase of their wealth; a spirit that unhappily meeting with an exercise of power in England which, however lawful, is noc reconcilable to any ideas of liberty, much less with theirs, has kindled this flame that is ready to consume us.
10073-8{_}5470{_}_Appendix 3_      PARABLE OF THE SOWER     (Matthew 13:3,8 and 18-23)  And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;  And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:  Some fell upon stony places, where they bad not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:  And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
10073-8{_}5471{_}And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:  But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
10073-8{_}5472{_}Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
10073-8{_}5473{_}When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.
10073-8{_}5474{_}This is he which received seed by the way side.
10073-8{_}5475{_}But be that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it.
10073-8{_}5476{_}Yet he hath not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
10073-8{_}5477{_}He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
10073-8{_}5478{_}But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

10073-8{_}5480{_}At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
10073-8{_}5481{_}And then the whaling school-boy, with his satchel, And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.
10073-8{_}5482{_}And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow.
10073-8{_}5483{_}Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth.
10073-8{_}5484{_}And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.
10073-8{_}5485{_}The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose well say'd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound.
10073-8{_}5486{_}Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
10073-8{_}5487{_}_Appendix 5_      THE CASTAWAY     (From _Robinson Crusoe_)     By Daniel Defoe  And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not escape, and that we should be inevitably drowned.
10073-8{_}5488{_}As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew that when the boat came near the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the beach of the sea.
10073-8{_}5489{_}However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards land.
10073-8{_}5490{_}What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.
10073-8{_}5491{_}But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.
10073-8{_}5492{_}After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the _coup de grace_.
10073-8{_}5493{_}In a word, it took us with such a fury that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from the boat as from one another, gave its not time hardly to say, "O God!"
10073-8{_}5494{_}for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
10073-8{_}5495{_}Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in.
10073-8{_}5496{_}I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore if possible; my greatest concern now being that the wave, as it would carry me a great way toward the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.
10073-8{_}5497{_}The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself I carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.
10073-8{_}5498{_}I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when as I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage.
10073-8{_}5499{_}I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet.
10073-8{_}5500{_}I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and till the waters went from me, and then took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had, farther towards the shore.
10073-8{_}5501{_}But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.
10073-8{_}5502{_}The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow, taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back.
10073-8{_}5503{_}Now, as the waves were not so high as at first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I got to the mainland; where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water.
10073-8{_}5504{_}I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope.
10073-8{_}5505{_}I believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at that custom, when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him--I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him.
10073-8{_}5506{_}"For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first."
10073-8{_}5507{_}I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except three of their bats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.
10073-8{_}5508{_}I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off; and considered, Lord!
10073-8{_}5509{_}how was it possible I could get on shore?
10073-8{_}5510{_}After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done: and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I bad a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs.
10073-8{_}5511{_}In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box.
10073-8{_}5512{_}This was all my provision; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for awhile I ran about like a madman.
10073-8{_}5513{_}Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their prey.
10073-8{_}5514{_}All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get up into a thick busby tree, like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life.
10073-8{_}5515{_}I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did to my great joy; and having drunk, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall.
10073-8{_}5516{_}And having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defense, I took up my lodging; and being excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself more refreshed with it than I think I ever was on such an occasion.
10073-8{_}5517{_}When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against it.
10073-8{_}5518{_}This being within about a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for my use.
10073-8{_}5519{_}When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand.
10073-8{_}5520{_}I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence.
10073-8{_}5521{_}A little after noon I found the sea very calm and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.
10073-8{_}5522{_}And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe: that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was.
10073-8{_}5523{_}This forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship-, so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water.
10073-8{_}5524{_}But when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of.
10073-8{_}5525{_}I swam round her twice, and the second time I espied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging down by the fore-chains so low that, with great difficulty, I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of the ship.
10073-8{_}5526{_}Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water.
10073-8{_}5527{_}By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free.
10073-8{_}5528{_}And, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose.
10073-8{_}5529{_}I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was before me.
10073-8{_}5530{_}Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.
10073-8{_}5531{_}It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this extremity roused my application.
10073-8{_}5532{_}We had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship: I resolved to fall tp work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away.
10073-8{_}5533{_}When this was done I went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me I tied four of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them, crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.
10073-8{_}5534{_}So I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and pains.
10073-8{_}5535{_}But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another occasion.
10073-8{_}5536{_}My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.
10073-8{_}5537{_}My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering this.
10073-8{_}5538{_}I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these I filled with provisions--viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed.
10073-8{_}5539{_}There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all.
10073-8{_}5540{_}As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of arrack.
10073-8{_}5541{_}These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.
10073-8{_}5542{_}While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away.
10073-8{_}5543{_}As for my breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings.
10073-8{_}5544{_}However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore: and it was after long searching that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have been at that time.
10073-8{_}5545{_}I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
10073-8{_}5546{_}My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
10073-8{_}5547{_}There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols.
10073-8{_}5548{_}These I secured first, with some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords.
10073-8{_}5549{_}I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.
10073-8{_}5550{_}Those two I got to my raft, with the arms.
10073-8{_}5551{_}And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.
10073-8{_}5552{_}I had three encouragements: first, a smooth, calm sea; secondly, the tide rising, and setting in to the shore; thirdly, what little wind there was blew me towards the land.
10073-8{_}5553{_}And thus, having found two or three broken oars, belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, two saws, an axe, and a hammer, with this cargo I put to sea.
10073-8{_}5554{_}For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before: by which I perceived that there was some indraught of the water, and consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might malze use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
10073-8{_}5555{_}As I imagined, so it was.
10073-8{_}5556{_}There appeared before me a little opening of the land.
10073-8{_}5557{_}I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.
10073-8{_}5558{_}But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
10073-8{_}5559{_}I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up.
10073-8{_}5560{_}I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river; hoping in time to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could.
10073-8{_}5561{_}At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near, that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in.
10073-8{_}5562{_}But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep-that is to say, sloping--there was no place to land but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again.
10073-8{_}5563{_}All that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did.
10073-8{_}5564{_}As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground-one on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, near the other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
10073-8{_}5565{_}_Appendix 6_      READING LISTS  One of the best ways to _know_ words is through seeing them used by the masters.
10073-8{_}5566{_}For this reason, as well as for many others, you should read extensively in good literature.
10073-8{_}5567{_}The following lists of prose works may prove useful for your guidance.
10073-8{_}5568{_}They are not intended to be exclusive, not intended to designate "the hundred best books."
10073-8{_}5569{_}Rather do they name some good books of fairly varied types.
10073-8{_}5570{_}These are not all of equal merit, even in their use of words.
10073-8{_}5571{_}Some use words with nice discrimination, some with splendid vividness and force.
10073-8{_}5572{_}For each author only one or two books are named, but in many instances you will wish to read further in the author, perhaps indeed his entire works.

10073-8{_}5686{_}Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
10073-8{_}5687{_}It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
10073-8{_}5688{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10073-8{_}5689{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10073-8{_}5699{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10073-8{_}5700{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10073-8{_}5701{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10073-8{_}5702{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
10073-8{_}5703{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
10073-8{_}5704{_}To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
10073-8{_}5705{_}International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
10073-8{_}5706{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
10073-8{_}5707{_}Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
10073-8{_}5708{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10073-8{_}5710{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10073-8{_}5711{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10073-8{_}5712{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10073-8{_}5713{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10073-8{_}5714{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10073-8{_}5715{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10073-8{_}5716{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10073-8{_}5717{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10073-8{_}5718{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10073-8{_}5719{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10073-8{_}5720{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10073-8{_}5721{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10073-8{_}5722{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10073-8{_}5723{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10073-8{_}5724{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10073-8{_}5725{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10073-8{_}5726{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
