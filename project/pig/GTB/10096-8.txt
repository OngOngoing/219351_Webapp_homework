10096-8{_}2{_}REGIUS PROFESSOR OF GREEK IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD    1915    THE TROJAN WOMEN   In his clear preface, Gilbert Murray says with truth that _The Trojan Women_, valued by the usage of the stage, is not a perfect play.
10096-8{_}3{_}"It is only the crying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music."
10096-8{_}4{_}Yet it is one of the greater dramas of the elder world.
10096-8{_}5{_}In one situation, with little movement, with few figures, it flashes out a great dramatic lesson, the infinite pathos of a successful wrong.
10096-8{_}6{_}It has in it the very soul of the tragic.
10096-8{_}7{_}It even goes beyond the limited tragic, and hints that beyond the defeat may come a greater glory than will be the fortune of the victors.
10096-8{_}8{_}And thus through its pity and terror it purifies our souls to thoughts of peace.
10096-8{_}9{_}Great art has no limits of locality or time.
10096-8{_}10{_}Its tidings are timeless, and its messages are universal.
10096-8{_}11{_}_The Trojan Women_ was first performed in 415 B.C., from a story of the siege of Troy which even then was ancient history.
10096-8{_}12{_}But the pathos of it is as modern to us as it was to the Athenians.
10096-8{_}13{_}The terrors of war have not changed in three thousand years.
10096-8{_}14{_}Euripides had that to say of war which we have to say of it to-day, and had learned that which we are even now learning, that when most triumphant it brings as much wretchedness to the victors as to the vanquished.
10096-8{_}15{_}In this play the great conquest "seems to be a great joy and is in truth a great misery."
10096-8{_}16{_}The tragedy of war has in no essential altered.
10096-8{_}17{_}The god Poseidon mourns over Troy as he might over the cities of to-day, when he cries:   "How are ye blind, Ye treaders down of cities, ye that cast Temples to desolation, and lay waste Tombs, the untrodden sanctuaries where lie The ancient dead; yourselves so soon to die!"
10096-8{_}18{_}To the cities of this present day might the prophetess Cassandra speak her message:   "Would ye be wise, ye Cities, fly from war!
10096-8{_}19{_}Yet if war come, there is a crown in death For her that striveth well and perisheth Unstained: to die in evil were the stain!"
10096-8{_}20{_}A throb of human sympathy as if with one of our sisters of to-day comes to us at the end, when the city is destroyed and its queen would throw herself, living, into its flames.
10096-8{_}21{_}To be of the action of this play the imagination needs not to travel back over three thousand years of history.
10096-8{_}22{_}It can simply leap a thousand leagues of ocean.
10096-8{_}23{_}If ever wars are to be ended, the imagination of man must end them.
10096-8{_}24{_}To the common mind, in spite of all its horrors, there is still something glorious in war.
10096-8{_}25{_}Preachers have preached against it in vain; economists have argued against its wastefulness in vain.
10096-8{_}26{_}The imagination of a great poet alone can finally show to the imagination of the world that even the glories of war are an empty delusion.
10096-8{_}27{_}Euripides shows us, as the centre of his drama, women battered and broken by inconceivable torture--the widowed Hecuba, Andromache with her child dashed to death, Cassandra ravished and made mad--yet does he show that theirs are the unconquered and unconquerable spirits.
10096-8{_}28{_}The victorious men, flushed with pride, have remorse and mockery dealt out to them by those they fought for, and go forth to unpitied death.
10096-8{_}29{_}Never surely can a great tragedy seem more real to us, or purge our souls more truly of the unreality of our thoughts and feelings concerning vital issues, than can The Trojan Women at this moment of the history of the world.

10096-8{_}31{_}_May the first, 1915_.
10096-8{_}32{_}INTRODUCTORY NOTE   Judged by common standards, the Troädes is far from a perfect play; it is scarcely even a good play.
10096-8{_}33{_}It is an intense study of one great situation, with little plot, little construction, little or no relief or variety.
10096-8{_}34{_}The only movement of the drama is a gradual extinguishing of all the familiar lights of human life, with, perhaps, at the end, a suggestion that in the utterness of night, when all fears of a possible worse thing are passed, there is in some sense peace and even glory.
10096-8{_}35{_}But the situation itself has at least this dramatic value, that it is different from what it seems.
10096-8{_}36{_}The consummation of a great conquest, a thing celebrated in paeans and thanksgivings, the very height of the day-dreams of unregenerate man--it seems to be a great joy, and it is in truth a great misery.
10096-8{_}37{_}It is conquest seen when the thrill of battle is over, and nothing remains but to wait and think.
10096-8{_}38{_}We feel in the background the presence of the conquerors, sinister and disappointed phantoms; of the conquered men, after long torment, now resting in death.
10096-8{_}39{_}But the living drama for Euripides lay in the conquered women.
10096-8{_}40{_}It is from them that he has named his play and built up his scheme of parts: four figures clearly lit and heroic, the others in varying grades of characterisation, nameless and barely articulate, mere half-heard voices of an eternal sorrow.
10096-8{_}41{_}Indeed, the most usual condemnation of the play is not that it is dull, but that it is too harrowing; that scene after scene passes beyond the due limits of tragic art.
10096-8{_}42{_}There are points to be pleaded against this criticism.
10096-8{_}43{_}The very beauty of the most fearful scenes, in spite of their fearfulness, is one; the quick comfort of the lyrics is another, falling like a spell of peace when the strain is too hard to bear (cf.
10096-8{_}44{_}p. 89).
10096-8{_}45{_}But the main defence is that, like many of the greatest works of art, the _Troädes_ is something more than art.
10096-8{_}46{_}It is also a prophecy, a bearing of witness.
10096-8{_}47{_}And the prophet, bound to deliver his message, walks outside the regular ways of the artist.
10096-8{_}48{_}For some time before the _Troädes_ was produced, Athens, now entirely in the hands of the War Party, had been engaged in an enterprise which, though on military grounds defensible, was bitterly resented by the more humane minority, and has been selected by Thucydides as the great crucial crime of the war.
10096-8{_}49{_}She had succeeded in compelling the neutral Dorian island of Mêlos to take up arms against her, and after a long siege had conquered the quiet and immemorially ancient town, massacred the men and sold the women and children into slavery.
10096-8{_}50{_}Mêlos fell in the autumn of 416 B.C.
10096-8{_}51{_}The _Troädes_ was produced in the following spring.
10096-8{_}52{_}And while the gods of the prologue were prophesying destruction at sea for the sackers of Troy, the fleet of the sackers of Mêlos, flushed with conquest and marked by a slight but unforgettable taint of sacrilege, was actually preparing to set sail for its fatal enterprise against Sicily.
10096-8{_}53{_}Not, of course, that we have in the _Troädes_ a case of political allusion.
10096-8{_}54{_}Far from it.
10096-8{_}55{_}Euripides does not mean Mêlos when he says Troy, nor mean Alcibiades' fleet when he speaks of Agamemnon's.
10096-8{_}56{_}But he writes under the influence of a year which to him, as to Thucydides, had been filled full of indignant pity and of dire foreboding.
10096-8{_}57{_}This tragedy is perhaps, in European literature, the first great expression of the spirit of pity for mankind exalted into a moving principle; a principle which has made the most precious, and possibly the most destructive, elements of innumerable rebellions, revolutions, and martyrdoms, and of at least two great religions.
10096-8{_}58{_}Pity is a rebel passion.
10096-8{_}59{_}Its hand is against the strong, against the organised force of society, against conventional sanctions and accepted Gods.
10096-8{_}60{_}It is the Kingdom of Heaven within us fighting against the brute powers of the world; and it is apt to have those qualities of unreason, of contempt for the counting of costs and the balancing of sacrifices, of recklessness, and even, in the last resort, of ruthlessness, which so often mark the paths of heavenly things and the doings of the children of light.
10096-8{_}61{_}It brings not peace, but a sword.
10096-8{_}62{_}So it was with Euripides.
10096-8{_}63{_}The _Troädes_ itself has indeed almost no fierceness and singularly little thought of revenge.
10096-8{_}64{_}It is only the crying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music, as it were, and made beautiful by "the most tragic of the poets."
10096-8{_}65{_}But its author lived ever after in a deepening atmosphere of strife and even of hatred, down to the day when, "because almost all in Athens rejoiced at his suffering," he took his way to the remote valleys of Macedon to write the _Bacchae_ and to die.

10096-8{_}88{_}'Twas I whose power, With great Apollo, builded tower by tower These walls of Troy; and still my care doth stand True to the ancient People of my hand; Which now as smoke is perished, in the shock Of Argive spears.
10096-8{_}89{_}Down from Parnassus' rock The Greek Epeios came, of Phocian seed, And wrought by Pallas' mysteries a Steed Marvellous[2], big with arms; and through my wall It passed, a death-fraught image magical.
10096-8{_}90{_}The groves are empty and the sanctuaries Run red with blood.
10096-8{_}91{_}Unburied Priam lies By his own hearth, on God's high altar-stair, And Phrygian gold goes forth and raiment rare To the Argive ships; and weary soldiers roam Waiting the wind that blows at last for home, For wives and children, left long years away, Beyond the seed's tenth fullness and decay, To work this land's undoing.
10096-8{_}92{_}And for me, Since Argive Hera conquereth, and she Who wrought with Hera to the Phrygians' woe, Pallas, behold, I bow mine head and go Forth from great Ilion[3] and mine altars old.

10096-8{_}94{_}And others yet there are, High women, chosen from the waste of war For the great kings, behind these portals hid; And with them that Laconian Tyndarid[4], Helen, like them a prisoner and a prize.
10096-8{_}95{_}And this unhappy one--would any eyes Gaze now on Hecuba?
10096-8{_}96{_}Here at the Gates She lies 'mid many tears for many fates Of wrong.

10096-8{_}1097{_}--In the _Iliad_ Poseidon is the enemy of Troy, here the friend.
10096-8{_}1098{_}This sort of confusion comes from the fact that the Trojans and their Greek enemies were largely of the same blood, with the same tribal gods.
10096-8{_}1099{_}To the Trojans, Athena the War-Goddess was, of course, _their_ War-Goddess, the protectress of their citadel.
10096-8{_}1100{_}Poseidon, god of the sea and its merchandise, and Apollo (possibly a local shepherd god?
10096-8{_}1101{_}), were their natural friends and had actually built their city wall for love of the good old king, Laomedon.
10096-8{_}1102{_}Zeus, the great father, had Mount Ida for his holy hill and Troy for his peculiar city.
10096-8{_}1103{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1104{_}on p.
10096-8{_}1105{_}63.)
10096-8{_}1106{_}To suit the Greek point of view all this had to be changed or explained away.
10096-8{_}1107{_}In the _Iliad_ generally Athena is the proper War-Goddess of the Greeks.
10096-8{_}1108{_}Poseidon had indeed built the wall for Laomedon, but Laomedon had cheated him of his reward--as afterwards he cheated Heracles, and the Argonauts and everybody else!
10096-8{_}1109{_}So Poseidon hated Troy.
10096-8{_}1110{_}Troy is chiefly defended by the barbarian Ares, the oriental Aphrodite, by its own rivers Scamander and Simois and suchlike inferior or unprincipled gods.
10096-8{_}1111{_}Yet traces of the other tradition remain.
10096-8{_}1112{_}Homer knows that Athena is specially worshipped in Troy.
10096-8{_}1113{_}He knows that Apollo, who had built the wall with Poseidon, and had the same experience of Laomedon, still loves the Trojans.
10096-8{_}1114{_}Zeus himself, though eventually in obedience to destiny he permits the fall of the city, nevertheless has a great tenderness towards it.
10096-8{_}1115{_}[2] A steed marvellous.]

10096-8{_}1117{_}[3] go forth from great Ilion, &c.]--The correct ancient doctrine.
10096-8{_}1118{_}When your gods forsook you, there was no more hope.
10096-8{_}1119{_}Conversely, when your state became desperate, evidently your gods were forsaking you.
10096-8{_}1120{_}From another point of view, also, when the city was desolate and unable to worship its gods, the gods of that city were no more.
10096-8{_}1121{_}[4] Laotian Tyndarid.]
10096-8{_}1122{_}--Helen was the child of Zeus and Leda, and sister of Castor and Polydeuces; but her human father was Tyndareus, an old Spartan king.
10096-8{_}1123{_}She is treated as "a prisoner and a prize," _i.e_., as a captured enemy, not as a Greek princess delivered from the Trojans.
10096-8{_}1124{_}[5] In secret slain.]
10096-8{_}1125{_}--Because the Greeks were ashamed of the bloody deed.
10096-8{_}1126{_}See below, p. 42, and the scene on this subject in the _Hecuba_.
10096-8{_}1127{_}[6] Cassandra.]
10096-8{_}1128{_}--In the _Agamemnon_ the story is more clearly told, that Cassandra was loved by Apollo and endowed by him with the power of prophecy; then in some way she rejected or betrayed him, and he set upon her the curse that though seeing the truth she should never be believed.
10096-8{_}1129{_}The figure of Cassandra in this play is not inconsistent with that version, but it makes a different impression.
10096-8{_}1130{_}She is here a dedicated virgin, and her mystic love for Apollo does not seem to have suffered any breach.
10096-8{_}1131{_}[7] Pallas.]
10096-8{_}1132{_}--(See above.)
10096-8{_}1133{_}The historical explanation of the Trojan Pallas and the Greek Pallas is simple enough; but as soon as the two are mythologically personified and made one, there emerges just such a bitter and ruthless goddess as Euripides, in his revolt against the current mythology, loved to depict.
10096-8{_}1134{_}But it is not only the mythology that he is attacking.
10096-8{_}1135{_}He seems really to feel that if there are conscious gods ruling the world, they are cruel or "inhuman" beings.
10096-8{_}1136{_}[8]--Ajax the Less, son of Oïleus, either ravished or attempted to ravish Cassandra (the story occurs in both forms) while she was clinging to the Palladium or image of Pallas.
10096-8{_}1137{_}It is one of the great typical sins of the Sack of Troy, often depicted on vases.
10096-8{_}1138{_}[9] Faces of ships.]
10096-8{_}1139{_}--Homeric ships had prows shaped and painted to look like birds' or beasts' heads.
10096-8{_}1140{_}A ship was always a wonderfully live and vivid thing to the Greek poets.

10096-8{_}1150{_}[12] Pirênê.]

10096-8{_}1152{_}Drawing water was a typical employment of slaves.
10096-8{_}1153{_}[13] ff., Theseus' land, &c.]--Theseus' land is Attica.
10096-8{_}1154{_}The poet, in the midst of his bitterness over the present conduct of his city, clings the more to its old fame for humanity.
10096-8{_}1155{_}The "land high-born" where the Penêüs flows round the base of Mount Olympus in northern Thessaly is one of the haunts of Euripides' dreams in many plays.

10096-8{_}1158{_}Mount Aetna fronts the "Tyrians' citadel," _i.e._., Carthage, built by the Phoenicians.
10096-8{_}1159{_}The "sister land" is the district of Sybaris in South Italy, where the river Crathis has, or had, a red-gold colour, which makes golden the hair of men and the fleeces of sheep; and the water never lost its freshness.
10096-8{_}1160{_}[14] Talthybius is a loyal soldier with every wish to be kind.
10096-8{_}1161{_}But he is naturally in good spirits over the satisfactory end of the war, and his tact is not sufficient to enable him to understand the Trojan Women's feelings.
10096-8{_}1162{_}Yet in the end, since he has to see and do the cruelties which his Chiefs only order from a distance, the real nature of his work forces itself upon him, and he feels and speaks at times almost like a Trojan.
10096-8{_}1163{_}It is worth noticing how the Trojan Women generally avoid addressing him.

10096-8{_}1177{_}She takes the watching of a Tomb to be some strange Greek custom, and does not seek to have it explained further.
10096-8{_}1178{_}[17] Odysseus.]
10096-8{_}1179{_}--In Euripides generally Odysseus is the type of the successful unscrupulous man, as soldier and politician--the incarnation of what the poet most hated.
10096-8{_}1180{_}In Homer of course he is totally different.
10096-8{_}1181{_}[18] Burn themselves and die.]
10096-8{_}1182{_}--Women under these circumstances did commit suicide in Euripides' day, as they have ever since.
10096-8{_}1183{_}It is rather curious that none of the characters of the play, not even Andromache, kills herself.
10096-8{_}1184{_}The explanation must be that no such suicide was recorded in the tradition (though cf.
10096-8{_}1185{_}below, on p. 33); a significant fact, suggesting that in the Homeric age, when this kind of treatment of women captives was regular, the victims did not suffer quite so terribly under it.
10096-8{_}1186{_}[19] Hymen.]
10096-8{_}1187{_}--She addresses the Torch.
10096-8{_}1188{_}The shadowy Marriage-god "Hymen" was a torch and a cry as much as anything more personal.
10096-8{_}1189{_}As a torch he is the sign both of marriage and of death, of sunrise and of the consuming fire.
10096-8{_}1190{_}The full Moon was specially connected with marriage ceremonies.
10096-8{_}1191{_}[20] Loxias.]
10096-8{_}1192{_}--The name of Apollo as an Oracular God.
10096-8{_}1193{_}[21] Cassandra's visions.]
10096-8{_}1194{_}--The allusions are to the various sufferings of Odysseus, as narrated in the _Odyssey_, and to the tragedies of the house of Atreus, as told for instance in Aeschylus' _Oresteia_.
10096-8{_}1195{_}Agamemnon together with Cassandra, and in part because he brought Cassandra, was murdered--felled with an axe--on his return home by his wife Clytaemnestra and her lover Aegisthus.
10096-8{_}1196{_}Their bodies were cast into a pit among the rocks.
10096-8{_}1197{_}In vengeance for this, Orestes, Agamemnon's son, committed "mother-murder," and in consequence was driven by the Erinyes (Furies) of his mother into madness and exile.
10096-8{_}1198{_}[22] This their king so wise.]
10096-8{_}1199{_}--Agamemnon made the war for the sake of his brother Menelaus, and slew his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice at Aulis, to enable the ships to sail for Troy.
10096-8{_}1200{_}[23] Hector and Paris.]
10096-8{_}1201{_}--The point about Hector is clear, but as to Paris, the feeling that, after all, it was a glory that he and the half-divine Helen loved each other, is scarcely to be found anywhere else in Greek literature.
10096-8{_}1202{_}(Cf., however, Isocrates' "Praise of Helen.")
10096-8{_}1203{_}Paris and Helen were never idealised like Launcelot and Guinevere, or Tristram and Iseult.
10096-8{_}1204{_}[24] A wise queen.]
10096-8{_}1205{_}--Penelope, the faithful wife of Odysseus.
10096-8{_}1206{_}[25] O Heralds, yea, Voices of Death.]
10096-8{_}1207{_}--There is a play on the word for "heralds" in the Greek here, which I have evaded by a paraphrase.
10096-8{_}1208{_}([Greek: Kaer-ukes] as though from [Greek: Kaer] the death-spirit, "the one thing abhorred of all mortal men.")
10096-8{_}1209{_}[26] That in this place she dies.]
10096-8{_}1210{_}--The death of Hecuba is connected with a certain heap of stones on the shore of the Hellespont, called _Kunossêma_, or "Dog's Tomb."
10096-8{_}1211{_}According to one tradition (Eur.
10096-8{_}1212{_}_Hec_.
10096-8{_}1213{_}1259 ff.)
10096-8{_}1214{_}she threw herself off the ship into the sea; according to another she was stoned by the Greeks for her curses upon the fleet; but in both she is changed after death into a sort of Hell-hound.
10096-8{_}1215{_}M. Victor Bérard suggests that the dog first comes into the story owing to the accidental resemblance of the (hypothetical) Semitic word _S'qoulah_, "Stone" or "Stoning," and the Greek _Skulax_, dog.
10096-8{_}1216{_}The Homeric Scylla (_Skulla_) was also both a Stone and a Dog (_Phéneciens et Odyssée_, i.
10096-8{_}1217{_}213).
10096-8{_}1218{_}Of course in the present passage there is no direct reference to these wild sailor-stories.
10096-8{_}1219{_}[27] The wind comes quick.]--_i.e._.
10096-8{_}1220{_}The storm of the Prologue.
10096-8{_}1221{_}Three Powers: the three Erinyes.
10096-8{_}1222{_}[28] ff., Chorus.]
10096-8{_}1223{_}--The Wooden Horse is always difficult to understand, and seems to have an obscuring effect on the language of poets who treat of it.
10096-8{_}1224{_}I cannot help suspecting that the story arises from a real historical incident misunderstood.
10096-8{_}1225{_}Troy, we are told, was still holding out after ten years and could not be taken, until at last by the divine suggestions of Athena, a certain Epeios devised a "Wooden Horse."
10096-8{_}1226{_}What was the "device"?
10096-8{_}1227{_}According to the _Odyssey_ and most Greek poets, it was a gigantic wooden figure of a horse.
10096-8{_}1228{_}A party of heroes, led by Odysseus, got inside it and waited.
10096-8{_}1229{_}The Greeks made a show of giving up the siege and sailed away, but only as far as Tenedos.
10096-8{_}1230{_}The Trojans came out and found the horse, and after wondering greatly what it was meant for and what to do with it, made a breach in their walls and dragged it into the Citadel as a thank-offering to Pallas.
10096-8{_}1231{_}In the night the Greeks returned; the heroes in the horse came out and opened the gates, and Troy was captured.
10096-8{_}1232{_}It seems possible that the "device" really was the building of a wooden siege-tower, as high as the walls, with a projecting and revolving neck.
10096-8{_}1233{_}Such engines were (1) capable of being used at the time in Asia, as a rare and extraordinary device, because they exist on early Assyrian monuments; (2) certain to be misunderstood in Greek legendary tradition, because they were not used in Greek warfare till many centuries later.
10096-8{_}1234{_}(First, perhaps, at the sieges of Perinthus and Byzantium by Philip of Macedon, 340 B.C.)
10096-8{_}1235{_}It is noteworthy that in the great picture by Polygnôtus in the Leschê at Delphi "above the wall of Troy appears the head alone of the Wooden Horse" (_Paus_.
10096-8{_}1236{_}x.
10096-8{_}1237{_}26).
10096-8{_}1238{_}Aeschylus also (_Ag_.
10096-8{_}1239{_}816) has some obscure phrases pointing in the same direction: "A horse's brood, a shield-bearing people, launched with a leap about the Pleiads' setting, sprang clear above the wall," &c. Euripides here treats the horse metaphorically as a sort of war-horse trampling Troy.
10096-8{_}1240{_}[29] Her that spareth not, Heaven's yokeless rider.]
10096-8{_}1241{_}--Athena like a northern Valkyrie, as often in the _Iliad_.
10096-8{_}1242{_}If one tries to imagine what Athena, the War-Goddess worshipped by the Athenian mob, was like--what a mixture of bad national passions, of superstition and statecraft, of slip-shod unimaginative idealisation--one may partly understand why Euripides made her so evil.
10096-8{_}1243{_}Allegorists and high-minded philosophers might make Athena entirely noble by concentrating their minds on the beautiful elements in the tradition, and forgetting or explaining away all that was savage; he was determined to pin her down to the worst facts recorded of her, and let people worship such a being if they liked!
10096-8{_}1244{_}[30] To Artemis.]
10096-8{_}1245{_}--Maidens at the shrine of Artemis are a fixed datum in the tradition.
10096-8{_}1246{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1247{_}_Hec_.
10096-8{_}1248{_}935 ff.)
10096-8{_}1249{_}[31] Andromache and Hecuba.]
10096-8{_}1250{_}--This very beautiful scene is perhaps marred to most modern readers by an element which is merely a part of the convention of ancient mourning.
10096-8{_}1251{_}Each of the mourners cries: "There is no affliction like mine!"
10096-8{_}1252{_}and then proceeds to argue, as it were, against the other's counter claim.
10096-8{_}1253{_}One can only say that it was, after all, what they expected of each other; and I believe the same convention exists in most places where keening or wailing is an actual practice.
10096-8{_}1254{_}[32] Even as the sound of a song.]
10096-8{_}1255{_}--I have filled in some words which seem to be missing in the Greek here.
10096-8{_}1256{_}[33]Andromache.]
10096-8{_}1257{_}--This character is wonderfully studied.
10096-8{_}1258{_}She seems to me to be a woman who has not yet shown much character or perhaps had very intense experience, but is only waiting for sufficiently great trials to become a heroine and a saint.
10096-8{_}1259{_}There is still a marked element of conventionality in her description of her life with Hector; but one feels, as she speaks, that she is already past it.
10096-8{_}1260{_}Her character is built up of "_Sophrosyne_," of self-restraint and the love of goodness--qualities which often seem second-rate or even tiresome until they have a sufficiently great field in which to act.
10096-8{_}1261{_}Very characteristic is her resolution to make the best, and not the worst, of her life in Pyrrhus' house, with all its horror of suffering and apparent degradation.
10096-8{_}1262{_}So is the self-conquest by which she deliberately refrains from cursing her child's murderers, for the sake of the last poor remnant of good she can still do to him, in getting him buried.
10096-8{_}1263{_}The nobility of such a character depends largely, of course, on the intensity of the feelings conquered.
10096-8{_}1264{_}It is worth noting, in this connection, that Euripides is contradicting a wide-spread tradition (Robert, _Bild und Lied_, pp.
10096-8{_}1265{_}63 ff.).
10096-8{_}1266{_}Andromache, in the pictures of the Sack of Troy, is represented with a great pestle or some such instrument fighting with the Soldiers to rescue Astyanax ([Greek:'Andro-machae]= "Man-fighting").
10096-8{_}1267{_}Observe, too, what a climax of drama is reached by means of the very fact that Andromache, to the utmost of her power, tries to do nothing "dramatic," but only what will be best.
10096-8{_}1268{_}Her character in Euripides' play, _Andromache_, is, on the whole, similar to this, but less developed.
10096-8{_}1269{_}[34] In Salamis, filled with the foaming, &c.]--A striking instance of the artistic value of the Greek chorus in relieving an intolerable strain.
10096-8{_}1270{_}The relief provided is something much higher than what we ordinarily call "relief"; it is a stream of pure poetry and music in key with the sadness of the surrounding scene, yet, in a way, happy just because it is beautiful.
10096-8{_}1271{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1272{_}note on _Hippolytus_, 1.
10096-8{_}1273{_}732.)
10096-8{_}1274{_}The argument of the rather difficult lyric is: "This is not the first time Troy has been taken.
10096-8{_}1275{_}Long ago Heracles made war against the old king Laomedon, because he had not given him the immortal steeds that he promised.
10096-8{_}1276{_}And Telamon joined him; Telamon who might have been happy in his island of Salamis, among the bees and the pleasant waters, looking over the strait to the olive-laden hills of Athens, the beloved City!
10096-8{_}1277{_}And they took ship and slew Laomedon.
10096-8{_}1278{_}Yea, twice Zeus has destroyed Ilion!
10096-8{_}1279{_}(Second part.)
10096-8{_}1280{_}Is it all in vain that our Trojan princes have been loved by the Gods?
10096-8{_}1281{_}Ganymêdês pours the nectar of Zeus in his banquets, his face never troubled, though his motherland is burned with fire!
10096-8{_}1282{_}And, to say nothing of Zeus, how can the Goddess of Morning rise and shine upon us uncaring?
10096-8{_}1283{_}She loved Tithônus, son of Laomedon, and bore him up from us in a chariot to be her husband in the skies.
10096-8{_}1284{_}But all that once made them love us is gone!"
10096-8{_}1285{_}[35] Pools of thy bathing.]
10096-8{_}1286{_}--It is probable that Ganymêdês was himself originally a pool or a spring on Ida, now a pourer of nectar in heaven.
10096-8{_}1287{_}[36] Menelaus and Helen.]
10096-8{_}1288{_}--The meeting of Menelaus and Helen after the taking of Troy was naturally one of the great moments in the heroic legend.
10096-8{_}1289{_}The versions, roughly speaking, divide themselves into two.
10096-8{_}1290{_}In one (_Little Iliad_, Ar.
10096-8{_}1291{_}_Lysistr_.
10096-8{_}1292{_}155, Eur.
10096-8{_}1293{_}_Andromache_ 628) Menelaus is about to kill her, but as she bares her bosom to the sword, the sword falls from his hand.
10096-8{_}1294{_}In the other (Stesichorus, _Sack of Ilion_ (?))
10096-8{_}1295{_}Menelaus or some one else takes her to the ships to be stoned, and the men cannot stone her.
10096-8{_}1296{_}As Quintus of Smyrna says, "They looked on her as they would on a God!"
10096-8{_}1297{_}Both versions have affected Euripides here.
10096-8{_}1298{_}And his Helen has just the magic of the Helen of legend.
10096-8{_}1299{_}That touch of the supernatural which belongs of right to the Child of Heaven--a mystery, a gentleness, a strange absence of fear or wrath--is felt through all her words.
10096-8{_}1300{_}One forgets to think of her guilt or innocence; she is too wonderful a being to judge, too precious to destroy.
10096-8{_}1301{_}This supernatural element, being the thing which, if true, separates Helen from other women, and in a way redeems her, is for that reason exactly what Hecuba denies.
10096-8{_}1302{_}The controversy has a certain eternal quality about it: the hypothesis of heavenly enchantment and the hypothesis of mere bad behaviour, neither of them entirely convincing!
10096-8{_}1303{_}But the very curses of those that hate her make a kind of superhuman atmosphere about Helen in this play; she fills the background like a great well-spring of pain.
10096-8{_}1304{_}This Menelaus, however, is rather different from the traditional Menelaus.
10096-8{_}1305{_}Besides being the husband of Helen, he is the typical Conqueror, for whose sake the Greeks fought and to whom the central prize of the war belongs.
10096-8{_}1306{_}And we take him at the height of his triumph, the very moment for which he made the war!
10096-8{_}1307{_}Hence the peculiar bitterness with which he is treated, his conquest turning to ashes in his mouth, and his love a confused turmoil of hunger and hatred, contemptible and yet terrible.
10096-8{_}1308{_}The exit of the scene would leave a modern audience quite in doubt as to what happened, unless the action were much clearer than the words.
10096-8{_}1309{_}But all Athenians knew from the _Odyssey_ that the pair were swiftly reconciled, and lived happily together as King and Queen of Sparta.
10096-8{_}1310{_}[37] Thou deep base of the world.]
10096-8{_}1311{_}--These lines, as a piece of religious speculation, were very famous in antiquity.
10096-8{_}1312{_}And dramatically they are most important.
10096-8{_}1313{_}All through the play Hecuba is a woman of remarkable intellectual power and of fearless thought.
10096-8{_}1314{_}She does not definitely deny the existence of the Olympian gods, like some characters in Euripides, but she treats them as beings that have betrayed her, and whose name she scarcely deigns to speak.
10096-8{_}1315{_}It is the very godlessness of Hecuba's fortitude that makes it so terrible and, properly regarded, so noble.
10096-8{_}1316{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1317{_}p. 35 "Why call on things so weak?"
10096-8{_}1318{_}and p. 74 "They know, they know....") Such Gods were as a matter of fact the moral inferiors of good men, and Euripides will never blind his eyes to their inferiority.
10096-8{_}1319{_}And as soon as people see that their god is bad, they tend to cease believing in his existence at all.
10096-8{_}1320{_}(Hecuba's answer to Helen is not inconsistent with this, it is only less characteristic.)
10096-8{_}1321{_}Behind this Olympian system, however, there is a possibility of some real Providence or impersonal Governance of the world, to which here, for a moment, Hecuba makes a passionate approach.
10096-8{_}1322{_}If there is _any_ explanation, _any_ justice, even in the form of mere punishment of the wicked, she will be content and give worship!
10096-8{_}1323{_}But it seems that there is not.
10096-8{_}1324{_}Then at last there remains--what most but not all modern freethinkers would probably have begun to doubt at the very beginning--the world of the departed, the spirits of the dead, who are true, and in their dim way love her still (p. 71 "Thy father far away shall comfort thee," and the last scene of the play).
10096-8{_}1325{_}This last religion, faint and shattered by doubt as it is, represents a return to the most primitive "Pelasgian" beliefs, a worship of the Dead which existed long before the Olympian system, and has long outlived it.
10096-8{_}1326{_}[38] The fire-brand's image.]
10096-8{_}1327{_}--Hecuba, just before Paris' birth, dreamed that she gave birth to a fire-brand.
10096-8{_}1328{_}The prophets therefore advised that the babe should be killed; but Priam disobeyed them.
10096-8{_}1329{_}[39] Three Crowns of Life.]
10096-8{_}1330{_}--On the Judgment of Paris see Miss Harrison, _Prolegomena_.
10096-8{_}1331{_}pp.
10096-8{_}1332{_}292 ff.
10096-8{_}1333{_}Late writers degrade the story into a beauty contest between three thoroughly personal goddesses--and a contest complicated by bribery.
10096-8{_}1334{_}But originally the Judgment is rather a Choice between three possible lives, like the Choice of Heracles between Work and Idleness.
10096-8{_}1335{_}The elements of the choice vary in different versions: but in general Hera is royalty; Athena is prowess in war or personal merit; Aphrodite, of course, is love.
10096-8{_}1336{_}And the goddesses are not really to be distinguished from the gifts they bring.
10096-8{_}1337{_}They are what they give, and nothing more.
10096-8{_}1338{_}Cf.
10096-8{_}1339{_}the wonderful lyric _Androm_.
10096-8{_}1340{_}274 ff., where they come to "a young man walking to and fro alone, in an empty hut in the firelight."
10096-8{_}1341{_}There is an extraordinary effect in Helen herself _being_ one of the Crowns of Life--a fair equivalent for the throne of the world.
10096-8{_}1342{_}[40] Alexander ...
10096-8{_}1343{_}Paris.]
10096-8{_}1344{_}--Two plays on words in the Greek.
10096-8{_}1345{_}[41] The old Gate-Warden.]
10096-8{_}1346{_}--He and the Watchers are, of course, safely dead.
10096-8{_}1347{_}But on the general lines of the tradition it may well be that Helen is speaking the truth.
10096-8{_}1348{_}She loved both Menelaus and Paris; and, according to some versions, hated Dêiphobus, the Trojan prince who seized her after Paris' death.
10096-8{_}1349{_}There is a reference to Dêiphobus in the MSS.
10096-8{_}1350{_}of the play here, but I follow Wilamowitz in thinking it spurious.
10096-8{_}1351{_}[42] Chorus.]
10096-8{_}1352{_}--On the Trojan Zeus see above, on p. 11.
10096-8{_}1353{_}Mount Ida caught the rays of the rising sun in some special manner and distributed them to the rest of the world; and in this gleam of heavenly fire the God had his dwelling, which is now the brighter for the flames of his City going up like incense!
10096-8{_}1354{_}Nothing definite is known of the Golden Images and the Moon-Feasts.
10096-8{_}1355{_}[43] Towers of the Giants.]
10096-8{_}1356{_}--The pre-historic castles of Tiryns and Mycênae.
10096-8{_}1357{_}[44] May Helen be there.]--(Cf.
10096-8{_}1358{_}above.)
10096-8{_}1359{_}Pitanê was one of the five divisions of Sparta.
10096-8{_}1360{_}Athena had a "Bronzen House" on the acropolis of Sparta.
10096-8{_}1361{_}Simoïs, of course, the river of Troy.
10096-8{_}1362{_}[45] I make thee whole.]
10096-8{_}1363{_}--Here as elsewhere Hecuba fluctuates between fidelity to the oldest and most instinctive religion, and a rejection of all Gods.
10096-8{_}1364{_}[46] Lo, I have seen the open hand of God.]
10096-8{_}1365{_}--The text is, perhaps, imperfect here; but Professor Wilamowitz agrees with me that Hecuba has seen something like a vision.
10096-8{_}1366{_}The meaning of this speech is of the utmost importance.
10096-8{_}1367{_}It expresses the inmost theme of the whole play, a search for an answer to the injustice of suffering in the very splendour and beauty of suffering.
10096-8{_}1368{_}Of course it must be suffering of a particular kind, or, what comes to the same thing, suffering borne in a particular way; but in that case the answer seems to me to hold.
10096-8{_}1369{_}One does not really think the world evil because there are martyrs or heroes in it.
10096-8{_}1370{_}For them the elements of beauty which exist in any great trial of the spirit become so great as to overpower the evil that created them--to turn it from shame and misery into tragedy.
10096-8{_}1371{_}Of course to most sufferers, to children and animals and weak people, or those without inspiration, the doctrine brings no help.
10096-8{_}1372{_}It is a thing invented by a poet for himself.
10096-8{_}1373{_}[47] Thou of the Ages.]
10096-8{_}1374{_}--The Phrygian All-Father, identified with Zeus, son of Kronos.
10096-8{_}1375{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1376{_}on p.
10096-8{_}1377{_}11.)
10096-8{_}1378{_}[48] Now hast thou found thy prayer.]
10096-8{_}1379{_}--The Gods have deserted her, but she has still the dead.
10096-8{_}1380{_}(Cf.
10096-8{_}1381{_}above, on p.
10096-8{_}1382{_}71.)
10096-8{_}1383{_}[49] Forth to the dark Greek ships.]
10096-8{_}1384{_}--Curiously like another magnificent ending of a great poem, that of the _Chanson de Roland_, where Charlemagne is called forth on a fresh quest:   "Deus," dist li Reis, "si penuse est ma vie!"

10096-8{_}1474{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10096-8{_}1475{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10096-8{_}1496{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10096-8{_}1497{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10096-8{_}1498{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10096-8{_}1499{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10096-8{_}1500{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10096-8{_}1501{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10096-8{_}1502{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10096-8{_}1503{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10096-8{_}1504{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10096-8{_}1505{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10096-8{_}1506{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10096-8{_}1507{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10096-8{_}1508{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10096-8{_}1509{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10096-8{_}1510{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10096-8{_}1511{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10096-8{_}1512{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
