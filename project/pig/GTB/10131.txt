10131{_}2{_}These lists and their grading vary in the different states, although the same poems are used in many of them and there are some which are required in every state.
10131{_}3{_}In the preparation of this book the lists of the third and fourth grade poems prescribed by the syllabi of twelve states have been examined and the contents have been made up from these.
10131{_}4{_}The breadth of this method of selection insures the inclusion in this volume of a large proportion of the required poems for every state.
10131{_}5{_}Since the grading in different states varies so widely, teachers will find included, also, many poems which in their own particular states are required in other grades.
10131{_}6{_}It is hoped that this volume will be of real service to teachers in providing a collection of "required poems" in a form convenient for school use.

10131{_}8{_}Required Poems for Third and Fourth Grades    POEMS BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON   AUTUMN FIRES  In the other gardens   And all up the vale, From the autumn bonfires   See the smoke trail!
10131{_}9{_}Pleasant summer over   And all the summer flowers; The red fire blazes,   The grey smoke towers.
10131{_}10{_}Sing a song of seasons!
10131{_}11{_}Something bright in all!
10131{_}12{_}Flowers in the summer,   Fires in the fall!
10131{_}13{_}THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE  When children are playing alone on the green, In comes the playmate that never was seen.
10131{_}14{_}When children are happy and lonely and good, The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.
10131{_}15{_}Nobody heard him and nobody saw, His is a picture you never could draw, But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home, When children are happy and playing alone.
10131{_}16{_}He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass, He sings when you tinkle the musical glass; Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why, The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!
10131{_}17{_}He loves to be little, he hates to be big, 'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig; 'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.
10131{_}18{_}'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed, Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head; For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf, 'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself!
10131{_}19{_}THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS  At evening when the lamp is lit, Around the fire my parents sit.
10131{_}20{_}They sit at home, and talk and sing, And do not play at anything.
10131{_}21{_}Now, with my little gun, I crawl All in the dark along the wall, And follow round the forest track Away behind the sofa back.
10131{_}22{_}There in the night, where none can spy, All in my hunter's camp I lie, And play at books that I have read, Till it is time to go to bed.
10131{_}23{_}These are the hills, these are the woods, These are my starry solitudes, And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink.
10131{_}24{_}I see the others far away, As if in firelit camp they lay, And I, like to an Indian scout, Around their party prowled about.
10131{_}25{_}So, when my nurse comes in for me, Home I return across the sea, And go to bed with backward looks At my dear Land of Story-books.
10131{_}26{_}THE WIND  I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky; And all around I heard you pass, Like ladies' skirts across the grass--     O wind, a-blowing all day long,     O wind, that sings so loud a song!
10131{_}27{_}I saw the different things you did, But always you yourself you hid.
10131{_}28{_}I felt you push, I heard you call, I could not see yourself at all--     O wind, a-blowing all day long,     O wind, that sings so loud a song!
10131{_}29{_}O you that are so strong and cold, O blower, are you young or old?
10131{_}30{_}Are you a beast of field and tree, Or just a stronger child than me?
10131{_}31{_}O wind, a-blowing all day long,     O wind, that sings so loud a song!
10131{_}32{_}WINTER-TIME  Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, A frosty, fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two; and then, A blood-red orange, sets again.
10131{_}33{_}Before the stars have left the skies, At morning in the dark I rise; And shivering in my nakedness, By the cold candle, bathe and dress.
10131{_}34{_}Close by the jolly fire I sit To warm my frozen bones a bit; Or, with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door.
10131{_}35{_}When to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap; The cold wind burns my face, and blows Its frosty pepper up my nose.
10131{_}36{_}Black are my steps on silver sod; Thick blows my frosty breath abroad; And tree and house, and hill and lake, Are frosted like a wedding-cake.
10131{_}37{_}PIRATE STORY  Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,   Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.
10131{_}38{_}Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,   And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.
10131{_}39{_}Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,   Wary of the weather and steering by a star?
10131{_}40{_}Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,   To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?
10131{_}41{_}Hi!
10131{_}42{_}but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--   Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!
10131{_}43{_}Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,   The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.

10131{_}45{_}Wunst they wuz a little boy wouldn't say his prayers,-- An' when he went to bed at night, away upstairs, His Mammy heerd him holler, an' his Daddy heerd him bawl, An' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wuzn't there at all!
10131{_}46{_}An' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby-hole, an' press, An' seeked him up the chimbly-flue, an' ever' wheres, I guess; But all they ever found wuz thist his pants an' roundabout:-- An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you         Ef you             Don't                 Watch                     Out!

10131{_}52{_}THE BROOK-SONG    Little brook!
10131{_}53{_}Little brook!
10131{_}54{_}You have such a happy look-- Such a very merry manner, as you swerve and      curve and crook--   And your ripples, one and one,   Reach each other's hands and run Like laughing little children in the sun!
10131{_}55{_}Little brook, sing to me:   Sing about a bumblebee That tumbled from a lily-bell and grumbled      mumblingly,   Because he wet the film   Of his wings, and had to swim, While the water-bugs raced round and laughed      at him!
10131{_}56{_}Little brook--sing a song   Of a leaf that sailed along Down the golden-braided center of your current      swift and strong,   And a dragon-fly that lit   On the tilting rim of it, And rode away and wasn't scared a bit.
10131{_}57{_}And sing--how oft in glee   Came a truant boy like me, Who loved to lean and listen to your lilting      melody,   Till the gurgle and refrain   Of your music in his brain Wrought a happiness as keen to him as pain.
10131{_}58{_}Little brook--laugh and leap!
10131{_}59{_}Do not let the dreamer weep; Sing him all the songs of summer till he sink in      softest sleep;   And then sing soft and low   Through his dreams of long ago-- Sing back to him the rest he used to know!
10131{_}60{_}A LIFE LESSON  There!
10131{_}61{_}little girl!
10131{_}62{_}don't cry!
10131{_}63{_}They have broken your doll, I know;     And your tea-set blue,     And your play-house, too,   Are things of long ago; But childish troubles will soon pass by,        There!
10131{_}64{_}little girl!
10131{_}65{_}don't cry!
10131{_}66{_}There!
10131{_}67{_}little girl!
10131{_}68{_}don't cry!
10131{_}69{_}They have broken your slate, I know;     And the glad wild ways     Of your school-girl days   Are things of the long ago; But life and love will soon come by,        There!
10131{_}70{_}little girl!
10131{_}71{_}don't cry!
10131{_}72{_}There!
10131{_}73{_}little girl!
10131{_}74{_}don't cry!
10131{_}75{_}They have broken your heart, I know;     And the rainbow gleams     Of your youthful dreams   Are things of the long ago; But heaven holds all for which you sigh,        There!
10131{_}76{_}little girl!

10131{_}78{_}*       *       *       *       *   POEMS BY EDWARD LEAR   THE QUANGLE WANGLE'S HAT  On the top of the Crumpetty Tree   The Quangle Wangle sat, But his face you could not see,   On account of his Beaver Hat.
10131{_}79{_}For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide, With ribbons and bibbons on every side, And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace, So that nobody ever could see the face   Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.
10131{_}80{_}The Quangle Wangle said   To himself on the Crumpetty Tree, "Jam, and jelly, and bread   Are the best of food for me!
10131{_}81{_}But the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree The plainer than ever it seems to me That very few people come this way And that life on the whole is far from gay!"
10131{_}82{_}Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.
10131{_}83{_}But there came to the Crumpetty Tree   Mr. and Mrs. Canary; And they said, "Did ever you see   Any spot so charmingly airy?
10131{_}84{_}May we build a nest on your lovely Hat?
10131{_}85{_}Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!
10131{_}86{_}Oh, please let us come and build a nest Of whatever material suits you best,   Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"
10131{_}87{_}And besides, to the Crumpetty Tree   Came the Stork, the Duck, and the Owl; The Snail and the Bumblebee,   The Frog and the Fimble Fowl (The Fimble Fowl, with a corkscrew leg); And all of them said, "We humbly beg We may build our homes on your lovely Hat,-- Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!
10131{_}88{_}Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"
10131{_}89{_}And the Golden Grouse came there,   And the Pobble who has no toes, And the small Olympian bear,   And the Dong with a luminous nose.
10131{_}90{_}And the Blue Baboon who played the flute, And the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute, And the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,-- All came and built on the lovely Hat   Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.
10131{_}91{_}And the Quangle Wangle said   To himself on the Crumpetty Tree, "When all these creatures move   What a wonderful noise there'll be!"
10131{_}92{_}And at night by the light of the Mulberry moon They danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon, On the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree, And all were as happy as happy could be,   With the Quangle Wangle Quee.
10131{_}93{_}THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES  The Pobble who has no toes   Had once as many as we; When they said, "Some day you may lose them all,"   He replied, "Fish fiddle de-dee!"
10131{_}94{_}And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink Lavender water tinged with pink; For she said, "The World in general knows There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"
10131{_}95{_}The Pobble who has no toes   Swam across the Bristol Channel; But before he set out he wrapped his nose   In a piece of scarlet flannel.
10131{_}96{_}For his Aunt Jobiska said, "No harm Can come to his toes if his nose is warm; And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes Are safe--provided he minds his nose."
10131{_}97{_}The Pobble swam fast and well,   And when boats or ships came near him, He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell   So that all the world could hear him.
10131{_}98{_}And all the Sailors and Admirals cried, When they saw him nearing the farther side, "He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"
10131{_}99{_}But before he touched the shore--   The shore of the Bristol Channel, A sea-green Porpoise carried away   His wrapper of scarlet flannel.
10131{_}100{_}And when he came to observe his feet, Formerly garnished with toes so neat, His face at once became forlorn On perceiving that all his toes were gone!
10131{_}101{_}And nobody ever knew,   From that dark day to the present, Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,   In a manner so far from pleasant.
10131{_}102{_}Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray, Or crafty mermaids stole them away, Nobody knew; and nobody knows How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!
10131{_}103{_}The Pobble who has no toes   Was placed in a friendly Bark, And they rowed him back and carried him up   To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.
10131{_}104{_}And she made him a feast at his earnest wish, Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish; And she said, "It's a fact the whole world knows, That Pobbles are happier without their toes."
10131{_}105{_}THE JUMBLIES  They went to sea in a sieve, they did;   In a sieve they went to sea: In spite of all their friends could say, On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,   In a sieve they went to sea.
10131{_}106{_}And when the sieve turned round and round, And every one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"
10131{_}107{_}They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big; But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:   In a sieve we'll go to sea!"
10131{_}108{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}109{_}They sailed away in a sieve, they did,   In a sieve they sailed so fast, With only a beautiful pea-green veil Tied with a ribbon by way of a sail,   To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
10131{_}110{_}And every one said who saw them go, "Oh!
10131{_}111{_}won't they soon be upset, you know?
10131{_}112{_}For the sky is dark and the voyage is long, And happen what may, it's extremely wrong   In a sieve to sail so fast."
10131{_}113{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}114{_}The water it soon came in, it did;   The water it soon came in; So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet In a pinky paper all folded neat;   And they fastened it down with a pin.
10131{_}115{_}And they passed the night in a crockery-jar; And each of them said, "How wise we are!
10131{_}116{_}Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long, Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,   While round in our sieve we spin."
10131{_}117{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}118{_}And all night long they sailed away;   And when the sun went down, They whistled and warbled a moony song To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,   In the shade of the mountains brown.
10131{_}119{_}"O Timballoo!
10131{_}120{_}How happy we are When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!
10131{_}121{_}And all night long, in the moonlight pale, We sail away with a pea-green sail   In the shade of the mountains brown."
10131{_}122{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}123{_}They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,--   To a land all covered with trees: And they bought an owl and a useful cart, And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,   And a hive of silvery bees; And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws, And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws, And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,   And no end of Stilton cheese.
10131{_}124{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}125{_}And in twenty years they all came back,--   In twenty years or more; And every one said, "How tall they've grown!
10131{_}126{_}For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,   And the hills of the Chankly Bore."
10131{_}127{_}And they drank their health, and gave them a feast Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast; And every one said, "If we only live, We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,   To the hills of the Chankly Bore."
10131{_}128{_}Far and few, far and few,       Are the lands where the Jumblies live;     Their heads are green and their hands are blue;       And they went to sea in a sieve.
10131{_}129{_}*       *       *       *       *   POEMS BY HENRY W. LONGFELLOW   THE EMPEROR'S BIRD'S-NEST  Once the Emperor Charles of Spain,   With his swarthy, grave commanders, I forget in what campaign, Long besieged, in mud and rain,   Some old frontier town of Flanders.
10131{_}130{_}Up and down the dreary camp,   In great boots of Spanish leather, Striding with a measured tramp, These Hidalgos, dull and damp,   Cursed the Frenchmen, cursed the weather.
10131{_}131{_}Thus as to and fro they went,   Over upland and through hollow, Giving their impatience vent, Perched upon the Emperor's tent,   In her nest, they spied a swallow.
10131{_}132{_}Yes, it was a swallow's nest,   Built of clay and hair of horses, Mane, or tail, or dragoon's crest, Found on hedge-rows east and west,   After skirmish of the forces.
10131{_}133{_}Then an old Hidalgo said,   As he twirled his gray mustachio, "Sure this swallow overhead Thinks the Emperor's tent a shed,   And the Emperor but a Macho!"
10131{_}134{_}Hearing his imperial name   Coupled with those words of malice, Half in anger, half in shame, Forth the great campaigner came   Slowly from his canvas palace.
10131{_}135{_}"Let no hand the bird molest,"   Said he solemnly, "nor hurt her!"
10131{_}136{_}Adding then, by way of jest, "Golondrina is my guest,   'Tis the wife of some deserter!"
10131{_}137{_}Swift as bowstring speeds a shaft,   Through the camp was spread the rumor, And the soldiers, as they quaffed Flemish beer at dinner, laughed   At the Emperor's pleasant humor.
10131{_}138{_}So unharmed and unafraid   Sat the swallow still and brooded, Till the constant cannonade Through the walls a breach had made   And the siege was thus concluded.
10131{_}139{_}Then the army, elsewhere bent,   Struck its tents as if disbanding, Only not the Emperor's tent, For he ordered, ere he went,   Very curtly, "Leave it standing!"
10131{_}140{_}So it stood there all alone,   Loosely flapping, torn and tattered, Till the brood was fledged and flown, Singing o'er those walls of stone   Which the cannon-shot had shattered.
10131{_}141{_}THE RAINY DAY  The day is cold, and dark, and dreary; It rains, and the wind is never weary; The vine still clings to the mouldering wall, But at every gust the dead leaves fall,     And the day is dark and dreary!
10131{_}142{_}My life is cold, and dark, and dreary; It rains, and the wind is never weary; My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past, But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,     And the days are dark and dreary.
10131{_}143{_}Be still, sad heart!
10131{_}144{_}and cease repining; Behind the clouds is the sun still shining; Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall,     Some days must be dark and dreary.
10131{_}145{_}AN APRIL DAY        When the warm sun, that brings Seed-time and harvest, has returned again, 'Tis sweet to visit the still wood, where springs       The first flower of the plain.
10131{_}146{_}I love the season well, When forest glades are teeming with bright forms, Nor dark and many-folded clouds foretell       The coming-on of storms.
10131{_}147{_}From the earth's loosened mould The sapling draws its sustenance, and thrives; Though stricken to the heart with winter's cold,       The drooping tree revives.
10131{_}148{_}The softly-warbled song Comes from the pleasant woods, and colored wings Glance quick in the bright sun, that moves along       The forest openings.
10131{_}149{_}When the bright sunset fills The silver woods with light, the green slope throws Its shadows in the hollows of the hills,       And wide the upland glows.
10131{_}150{_}And when the eve is born, In the blue lake the sky, o'er-reaching far, Is hollowed out, and the moon dips her horn,       And twinkles many a star.
10131{_}151{_}Inverted in the tide, Stand the gray rocks, and trembling shadows throw, And the fair trees look over, side by side,       And see themselves below.
10131{_}152{_}Sweet April!--many a thought Is wedded unto thee, as hearts are wed; Nor shall they fail, till, to its autumn brought,       Life's golden fruit is shed.
10131{_}153{_}RAIN IN SUMMER  How beautiful is the rain!
10131{_}154{_}After the dust and heat, In the broad and fiery street, In the narrow lane, How beautiful is the rain!
10131{_}155{_}How it clatters along the roofs, Like the tramp of hoofs!
10131{_}156{_}How it gushes and struggles out From the throat of the overflowing spout!
10131{_}157{_}Across the window pane It pours and pours; And swift and wide, With a muddy tide, Like a river down the gutter roars The rain, the welcome rain!
10131{_}158{_}*    *    *    * In the country, on every side, Where far and wide, Like a leopard's tawny and spotted hide, Stretches the plain, To the dry grass and the drier grain How welcome is the rain!
10131{_}159{_}*    *    *    *  DAYBREAK  A wind came up out of the sea, And said, "O mists, make room for me."
10131{_}160{_}It hailed the ships, and cried, "Sail on, Ye mariners, the night is gone."
10131{_}161{_}And hurried landward far away, Crying, "Awake!
10131{_}162{_}it is the day."
10131{_}163{_}It said unto the forest, "Shout!
10131{_}164{_}Hang all your leafy banners out!"
10131{_}165{_}It touched the wood-bird's folded wing, And said, "O bird, awake and sing."
10131{_}166{_}And o'er the farms, "O Chanticleer, Your clarion blow; the day is near."
10131{_}167{_}It whispered to the fields of corn, "Bow down, and hail the coming morn."
10131{_}168{_}It shouted through the belfry tower, "Awake, O bell!
10131{_}169{_}proclaim the hour."
10131{_}170{_}It crossed the churchyard with a sigh, And said, "Not yet!
10131{_}171{_}in quiet lie."
10131{_}172{_}AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY  The day is ending, The night is descending; The marsh is frozen,   The river dead.
10131{_}173{_}Through clouds like ashes The red sun flashes On village windows   That glimmer red.
10131{_}174{_}The snow recommences; The buried fences Mark no longer   The road o'er the plain;  While through the meadows, Like fearful shadows, Slowly passes   A funeral train.
10131{_}175{_}The bell is pealing, And every feeling Within me responds   To the dismal knell;  Shadows are trailing, My heart is bewailing And tolling within   Like a funeral bell.
10131{_}176{_}HIAWATHA'S FISHING  Forth upon the Gitche Gumee, On the shining Big-Sea-Water, With his fishing-line of cedar, Of the twisted bark of cedar, Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma, Mishe-Nahma, King of Fishes, In his birch canoe exulting All alone went Hiawatha.
10131{_}177{_}Through the clear, transparent water He could see the fishes swimming Far down in the depths below him; See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,    Like a sunbeam in the water, See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish, Like a spider on the bottom, On the white and sandy bottom.
10131{_}178{_}At the stern sat Hiawatha, With his fishing-line of cedar; In his plumes the breeze of morning Played as in the hemlock branches; On the bows, with tail erected, Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo; In his fur the breeze of morning Played as in the prairie grasses.
10131{_}179{_}On the white sand of the bottom Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma, Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes; Through his gills he breathed the water, With his fins he fanned and winnowed, With his tail he swept the sand-floor.
10131{_}180{_}There he lay in all his armor; On each side a shield to guard him, Plates of bone upon his forehead, Down his sides and back and shoulders Plates of bone with spines projecting!
10131{_}181{_}Painted was he with his war-paints, Stripes of yellow, red, and azure, Spots of brown and spots of sable; And he lay there on the bottom, Fanning with his fins of purple, As above him Hiawatha In his birch canoe came sailing, With his fishing-line of cedar.
10131{_}182{_}"Take my bait!"
10131{_}183{_}cried Hiawatha, Down into the depths beneath him, "Take my bait, O sturgeon, Nahma!
10131{_}184{_}Come up from below the water, Let us see which is the stronger!"
10131{_}185{_}And he dropped his line of cedar Through the clear, transparent water, Waited vainly for an answer, Long sat waiting for an answer, And repeating loud and louder, "Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"
10131{_}186{_}Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma, Fanning slowly in the water, Looking up at Hiawatha, Listening to his call and clamor, His unnecessary tumult, Till he wearied of the shouting; And he said to the Kenozha, To the pike, the Maskenozha, "Take the bait of this rude fellow, Break the line of Hiawatha!"
10131{_}187{_}In his fingers Hiawatha Felt the loose line jerk and tighten; As he drew it in, it tugged so That the birch canoe stood endwise, Like a birch log in the water, With the squirrel, Adjidaumo, Perched and frisking on the summit.
10131{_}188{_}Full of scorn was Hiawatha When he saw the fish rise upward, Saw the pike, the Maskenozha, Coming nearer, nearer to him, And he shouted through the water, "Esa!
10131{_}189{_}esa!
10131{_}190{_}shame upon you!
10131{_}191{_}You are but the pike, Kenozha, You are not the fish I wanted, You are not the King of Fishes!"
10131{_}192{_}Reeling downward to the bottom Sank the pike in great confusion, And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma, Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish, To the bream, with scales of crimson, "Take the bait of this great boaster, Break the line of Hiawatha!"
10131{_}193{_}Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming, Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, Seized the line of Hiawatha, Swung with all his weight upon it, Made a whirlpool in the water, Whirled the birch canoe in circles, Round and round in gurgling eddies, Till the circles in the water Reached the far-off sandy beaches, Till the water-flags and rushes Nodded on the distant margins.
10131{_}194{_}But when Hiawatha saw him Slowly rising through the water, Lifting up his disk refulgent, Loud he shouted in derision, "Esa!
10131{_}195{_}esa!
10131{_}196{_}shame upon you!
10131{_}197{_}You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish, You are not the fish I wanted, You are not the King of Fishes!"
10131{_}198{_}Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming, Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, And again the sturgeon, Nahma, Heard the shout of Hiawatha, Heard his challenge of defiance, The unnecessary tumult, Ringing far across the water.
10131{_}199{_}From the white sand of the bottom Up he rose with angry gesture, Quivering in each nerve and fibre, Clashing all his plates of armor, Gleaming bright with all his war-paint; In his wrath he darted upward, Flashing leaped into the sunshine, Opened his great jaws, and swallowed Both canoe and Hiawatha.
10131{_}200{_}Down into that darksome cavern Plunged the headlong Hiawatha, As a log on some black river, Shoots and plunges down the rapids, Found himself in utter darkness, Groped about in helpless wonder, Till he felt a great heart beating, Throbbing in that utter darkness.
10131{_}201{_}And he smote it in his anger, With his fist, the heart of Nahma, Felt the mighty King of Fishes Shudder through each nerve and fibre, Heard the water gurgle round him As he leaped and staggered through it, Sick at heart, and faint and weary.
10131{_}202{_}Crosswise then did Hiawatha Drag his birch-canoe for safety, Lest from out the jaws of Nahma, In the turmoil and confusion, Forth he might be hurled and perish.
10131{_}203{_}And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, Frisked and chattered very gayly, Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha Till the labor was completed.
10131{_}204{_}Then said Hiawatha to him, "O my little friend, the squirrel, Bravely have you toiled to help me; Take the thanks of Hiawatha, And the name which now he gives you; For hereafter and forever Boys shall call you Adjidaumo, Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"
10131{_}205{_}And again the sturgeon, Nahma, Gasped and quivered in the water, Then was still, and drifted landward Till he grated on the pebbles, Till the listening Hiawatha Heard him grate upon the margin, Felt him strand upon the pebbles, Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes, Lay there dead upon the margin.
10131{_}206{_}Then he heard a clang and flapping, As of many wings assembling, Heard a screaming and confusion, As of birds of prey contending, Saw a gleam of light above him, Shining through the ribs of Nahma, Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls, Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering, Gazing at him through the opening, Heard them saying to each other, "'Tis our brother, Hiawatha!"
10131{_}207{_}And he shouted from below them, Cried exulting from the caverns: "O ye sea-gulls!
10131{_}208{_}O my brothers!
10131{_}209{_}I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma; Make the rifts a little larger, With your claws the openings widen, Set me free from this dark prison, And henceforward and forever Men shall speak of your achievements, Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"
10131{_}210{_}And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls Toiled with beak and claws together, Made the rifts and openings wider In the mighty ribs of Nahma, And from peril and from prison, From the body of the sturgeon, From the peril of the water, They released my Hiawatha.
10131{_}211{_}He was standing near his wigwam, On the margin of the water, And he called to old Nokomis, Called and beckoned to Nokomis, Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma, Lying lifeless on the pebbles, With the sea-gulls feeding on him.
10131{_}212{_}"I have slain the Mishe-Nahma, Slain the King of Fishes!"
10131{_}213{_}said he; "Look!
10131{_}214{_}the sea-gulls feed upon him, Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls; Drive them not away, Nokomis, They have saved me from great peril In the body of the sturgeon, Wait until their meal is ended, Till their craws are full with feasting, Till they homeward fly, at sunset, To their nests among the marshes; Then bring all your pots and kettles, And make oil for us in Winter."
10131{_}215{_}And she waited till the sun set, Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun, Rose above the tranquil water, Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls, From their banquet rose with clamor, And across the fiery sunset Winged their way to far-off islands, To their nests among the rushes.
10131{_}216{_}To his sleep went Hiawatha, And Nokomis to her labor, Toiling patient in the moonlight, Till the sun and moon changed places, Till the sky was red with sunrise, And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls, Came back from the reedy islands, Clamorous for their morning banquet.
10131{_}217{_}Three whole days and nights alternate Old Nokomis and the seagulls Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma, Till the waves washed through the rib-bones, Till the sea-gulls came no longer, And upon the sands lay nothing But the skeleton of Nahma.
10131{_}218{_}HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS  Two good friends had Hiawatha, Singled out from all the others, Bound to him in closest union, And to whom he gave the right hand Of his heart, in joy and sorrow; Chibiabos, the musician, And the very strong man, Kwasind.
10131{_}219{_}Straight between them ran the pathway, Never grew the grass upon it; Singing birds, that utter falsehoods, Story-tellers, mischief-makers, Found no eager ear to listen, Could not breed ill-will between them, For they kept each other's counsel, Spake with naked hearts together, Pondering much and much contriving How the tribes of men might prosper.
10131{_}220{_}Most beloved by Hiawatha Was the gentle Chibiabos, He the best of all musicians, He the sweetest of all singers.
10131{_}221{_}Beautiful and childlike was he, Brave as man is, soft as woman, Pliant as a wand of willow, Stately as a deer with antlers.
10131{_}222{_}When he sang, the village listened; All the warriors gathered round him, All the women came to hear him; Now he stirred their souls to passion, Now he melted them to pity.
10131{_}223{_}From the hollow reeds he fashioned Flutes so musical and mellow, That the brook, the Sebowisha, Ceased to murmur in the woodland, That the wood-birds ceased from singing, And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree, And the rabbit, the Wabasso, Sat upright to look and listen,  Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha, Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos, Teach my waves to flow in music, Softly as your words in singing!"
10131{_}224{_}Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa, Envious, said, "O Chibiabos, Teach me tones as wild and wayward, Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"
10131{_}225{_}Yes, the robin, the Opechee, Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos, Teach me tones as sweet and tender, Teach me songs as full of gladness!"
10131{_}226{_}And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa, Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos, Teach me tones as melancholy, Teach me songs as full of sadness!"
10131{_}227{_}All the many sounds of nature Borrowed sweetness from his singing; All the hearts of men were softened By the pathos of his music; For he sang of peace and freedom, Sang of beauty, love, and longing; Sang of death, and life undying In the Islands of the Blessed, In the kingdom of Ponemah, In the land of the Hereafter.
10131{_}228{_}Very dear to Hiawatha Was the gentle Chibiabos, He the best of all musicians, He the sweetest of all singers; For his gentleness he loved him, And the magic of his singing.
10131{_}229{_}Dear, too, unto Hiawatha Was the very strong man, Kwasind, He the strongest of all mortals, He the mightiest among many; For his very strength he loved him, For his strength allied to goodness.
10131{_}230{_}Idle in his youth was Kwasind, Very listless, dull, and dreamy, Never played with other children, Never fished and never hunted, Not like other children was he; But they saw that much he fasted, Much his Manito entreated, Much besought his Guardian Spirit.
10131{_}231{_}"Lazy Kwasind!"
10131{_}232{_}said his mother, "In my work you never help me!
10131{_}233{_}In the Summer you are roaming Idly in the fields and forests; In the Winter you are cowering O'er the firebrands in the wigwam!
10131{_}234{_}In the coldest days of Winter I must break the ice for fishing; With my nets you never help me!
10131{_}235{_}At the door my nets are hanging, Dripping, freezing with the water; Go and wring them, Yenadizze!
10131{_}236{_}Go and dry them in the sunshine!"
10131{_}237{_}Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind Rose, but made no angry answer; From the lodge went forth in silence, Took the nets, that hung together, Dripping, freezing at the doorway, Like a wisp of straw he wrung them, Like a wisp of straw he broke them, Could not wring them without breaking, Such the strength was in his fingers.
10131{_}238{_}"Lazy Kwasind!"
10131{_}239{_}said his father, "In the hunt you never help me; Every bow you touch is broken, Snapped asunder every arrow; Yet come with me to the forest, You shall bring the hunting homeward."
10131{_}240{_}Down a narrow pass they wandered, Where a brooklet led them onward, Where the trail of deer and bison Marked the soft mud on the margin, Till they found all further passage Shut against them, barred securely By the trunks of trees uprooted, Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise, And forbidding further passage.
10131{_}241{_}"We must go back," said the old man, "O'er these logs we cannot clamber; Not a woodchuck could get through them, Not a squirrel clamber o'er them!"
10131{_}242{_}And straightway his pipe he lighted, And sat down to smoke and ponder.
10131{_}243{_}But before his pipe was finished, Lo!
10131{_}244{_}the path was cleared before him; All the trunks had Kwasind lifted, To the right hand, to the left hand, Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows, Hurled the cedars light as lances.
10131{_}245{_}"Lazy Kwasind!"
10131{_}246{_}said the young men, As they sported in the meadow: "Why stand idly looking at us, Leaning on the rock behind you?
10131{_}247{_}Come and wrestle with the others, Let us pitch the quoit together!"
10131{_}248{_}Lazy Kwasind made no answer, To their challenge made no answer, Only rose, and, slowly turning, Seized the huge rock in his fingers, Tore it from its deep foundation, Poised it in the air a moment, Pitched it sheer into the river, Sheer into the swift Pauwating, Where it still is seen in Summer.
10131{_}249{_}Once as down that foaming river, Down the rapids of Pauwating, Kwasind sailed with his companions, In the stream he saw a beaver, Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers, Struggling with the rushing currents, Rising, sinking in the water.
10131{_}250{_}Without speaking, without pausing, Kwasind leaped into the river, Plunged beneath the bubbling surface, Through the whirlpools chased the beaver, Followed him among the islands, Stayed so long beneath the water, That his terrified companions Cried, "Alas!
10131{_}251{_}good-bye to Kwasind!
10131{_}252{_}We shall never more see Kwasind!"
10131{_}253{_}But he reappeared triumphant, And upon his shining shoulders Brought the beaver, dead and dripping, Brought the King of all the Beavers.
10131{_}254{_}And these two, as I have told you, Were the friends of Hiawatha, Chibiabos, the musician, And the very strong man, Kwasind.
10131{_}255{_}Long they lived in peace together, Spake with naked hearts together, Pondering much and much contriving How the tribes of men might prosper.
10131{_}256{_}HIAWATHA'S HUNTING  Forth into the forest straightway All alone walked Hiawatha Proudly, with his bow and arrows, And the birds sang round him, o'er him, "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
10131{_}257{_}Sang the robin, the Opechee, Sang the blue bird, the Owaissa, "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
10131{_}258{_}Up the oak tree, close beside him, Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo, In and out among the branches, Coughed and chattered from the oak tree, Laughed, and said between his laughing, "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
10131{_}259{_}And the rabbit from his pathway Leaped aside, and at a distance Sat erect upon his haunches, Half in fear and half in frolic, Saying to the little hunter, "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
10131{_}260{_}But he heeded not, nor heard them, For his thoughts were with the red deer; On their tracks his eyes were fastened, Leading downward to the river, To the ford across the river, And as one in slumber walked he,  Hidden in the alder bushes.
10131{_}261{_}There he waited till the deer came, Till he saw two antlers lifted, Saw two eyes look from the thicket, Saw two nostrils point to windward, And a deer came down the pathway, Flecked with leafy light and shadow.
10131{_}262{_}And his heart within him fluttered, Trembled like the leaves above him, Like the birch-leaf palpitated, As the deer came down the pathway.
10131{_}263{_}Then, upon one knee uprising, Hiawatha aimed an arrow; Scarce a twig moved with his motion, Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled, But the wary roebuck started, Stamped with all his hoofs together, Listened with one foot uplifted, Leaped as if to meet the arrow; Ah!
10131{_}264{_}the singing, fatal arrow, Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!
10131{_}265{_}Dead he lay there in the forest, By the ford across the river; Beat his timid heart no longer, But the heart of Hiawatha Throbbed and shouted and exulted, As he bore the red deer homeward, And Iagoo and Nokomis Hailed his coming with applauses.
10131{_}266{_}From the red deer's hide Nokomis Made a cloak for Hiawatha, From the red deer's flesh Nokomis Made a banquet in his honor.
10131{_}267{_}All the village came and feasted, All the guests praised Hiawatha, Called him Strong-heart, Soan-ge-taha!
10131{_}268{_}Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!
10131{_}269{_}HIAWATHA'S SAILING  "Give me of your bark, O Birch-Tree!
10131{_}270{_}Of your yellow bark, O Birch-Tree!
10131{_}271{_}Growing by the rushing river, Tall and stately in the valley!
10131{_}272{_}I a light canoe will build me, Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing, That shall float upon the river, Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, Like a yellow water-lily!
10131{_}273{_}"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-Tree!
10131{_}274{_}Lay aside your white-skin wrapper, For the Summer-time is coming, And the sun is warm in heaven, And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
10131{_}275{_}Thus aloud cried Hiawatha In the solitary forest, By the rushing Taquamenaw, When the birds were singing gayly, In the Moon of Leaves were singing, And the sun, from sleep awaking, Started up and said, "Behold me!
10131{_}276{_}Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
10131{_}277{_}And the tree with all its branches Rustled in the breeze of morning, Saying, with a sigh of patience, "Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"
10131{_}278{_}With his knife the tree he girdled; Just beneath its lowest branches, Just above the roots, he cut it, Till the sap came oozing outward: Down the trunk, from top to bottom, Sheer he cleft the bark asunder, With a wooden wedge he raised it, Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
10131{_}279{_}"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!
10131{_}280{_}Of your strong and pliant branches, My canoe to make more steady, Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
10131{_}281{_}Through the summit of the Cedar Went a sound, a cry of horror, Went a murmur of resistance; But it whispered, bending downward, "Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"
10131{_}282{_}Down he hewed the boughs of cedar, Shaped them straightway to a framework, Like two bows he formed and shaped them, Like two bended bows together.
10131{_}283{_}"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!
10131{_}284{_}Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-Tree!
10131{_}285{_}My canoe to bind together.
10131{_}286{_}So to bind the ends together, That the water may not enter, That the river may not wet me!"
10131{_}287{_}And the Larch, with all its fibres, Shivered in the air of morning, Touched his forehead with its tassels, Said, with one long sigh of sorrow, "Take them all, O Hiawatha!"
10131{_}288{_}From the earth he tore the fibres, Tore the tough roots of the Larch-Tree, Closely sewed the bark together, Bound it closely to the framework.
10131{_}289{_}"Give me of your balm, O Fir-Tree!
10131{_}290{_}Of your balsam and your resin, So to close the seams together That the water may not enter, That the river may not wet me!"
10131{_}291{_}And the Fir-Tree, tall and sombre, Sobbed through all its robes of darkness, Rattled like a shore with pebbles, Answered wailing, answered weeping, "Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"
10131{_}292{_}And he took the tears of balsam, Took the resin of the Fir-Tree, Smeared therewith each seam and fissure, Made each crevice safe from water.
10131{_}293{_}"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!
10131{_}294{_}All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!
10131{_}295{_}I will make a necklace of them, Make a girdle for my beauty, And two stars to deck her bosom!"
10131{_}296{_}From a hollow tree the Hedgehog With his sleepy eyes looked at him, Shot his shining quills, like arrows, Saying, with a drowsy murmur, Through the tangle of his whiskers, "Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"
10131{_}297{_}From the ground the quills he gathered, All the little shining arrows, Stained them red and blue and yellow, With the juice of roots and berries; Into his canoe he wrought them, Round its waist a shining girdle, Round its bow a gleaming necklace, On its breast two stars resplendent.
10131{_}298{_}Thus the Birch Canoe was builded In the valley, by the river, In the bosom of the forest; And the forest's life was in it, All its mystery and its magic, All the lightness of the birch-tree, All the toughness of the cedar, All the larch's supple sinews; And it floated on the river Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, Like a yellow water-lily.
10131{_}299{_}Paddles none had Hiawatha, Paddles none he had or needed, For his thoughts as paddles served him, And his wishes served to guide him; Swift or slow at will he glided, Veered to right or left at pleasure.
10131{_}300{_}Then he called aloud to Kwasind, To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, Saying, "Help me clear this river Of its sunken logs and sand-bars."
10131{_}301{_}Straight into the river Kwasind Plunged as if he were an otter, Dived as if he were a beaver, Stood up to his waist in water, To his arm-pits in the river, Swam and shouted in the river, Tugged at sunken logs and branches, With his hands he scooped the sand-bars, With his feet the ooze and tangle.
10131{_}302{_}And thus sailed my Hiawatha Down the rushing Taquamenaw, Sailed through all its bends and windings, Sailed through all its deeps and shallows, While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.
10131{_}303{_}Up and down the river went they, In and out among its islands, Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar, Dragged the dead trees from its channel, Made its passage safe and certain Made a pathway for the people, From its springs among the mountains, To the water of Pauwating, To the bay of Taquamenaw.

10131{_}313{_}I met a little cottage Girl: She was eight years old, she said; Her hair was thick with many a curl That clustered round her head.
10131{_}314{_}She had a rustic, woodland air, And she was wildly clad: Her eyes were fair, and very fair; --Her beauty made me glad.
10131{_}315{_}"Sisters and brothers, little Maid, How many may you be?"
10131{_}316{_}"How many?
10131{_}317{_}Seven in all," she said, And wondering looked at me.
10131{_}318{_}"And where are they?
10131{_}319{_}I pray you tell."
10131{_}320{_}She answered, "Seven are we; And two of us at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea.
10131{_}321{_}"Two of us in the church-yard lie, My sister and my brother; And, in the church-yard cottage, I Dwell near them with my mother."
10131{_}322{_}"You say that two at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea, Yet ye are seven!--I pray you tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be."
10131{_}323{_}Then did the little Maid reply, "Seven boys and girls are we; Two of us in the church-yard lie, Beneath the church-yard tree."
10131{_}324{_}"You run about, my little Maid, Your limbs they are alive; If two are in the church-yard laid, Then ye are only five."
10131{_}325{_}"Their graves are green, they may be seen," The little Maid replied, "Twelve steps or more from my mother's door, And they are side by side.
10131{_}326{_}"My stockings there I often knit, My kerchief there I hem; And there upon the ground I sit, And sing a song to them.
10131{_}327{_}"And often after sunset, Sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer, And eat my supper there.
10131{_}328{_}"The first that died was sister Jane; In bed she moaning lay, Till God released her of her pain; And then she went away.
10131{_}329{_}"So in the church-yard she was laid; And, when the grass was dry, Together round her grave we played, My brother John and I.
10131{_}330{_}"And when the ground was white with snow, And I could run and slide, My brother John was forced to go, And he lies by her side."
10131{_}331{_}"How many are you, then," said I, "If they two are in heaven?"
10131{_}332{_}Quick was the little Maid's reply, "O Master!
10131{_}333{_}we are seven."
10131{_}334{_}"But they are dead; those two are dead!
10131{_}335{_}Their spirits are in heaven!"
10131{_}336{_}'Twas throwing words away; for still The little Maid would have her will, And said, "Nay, we are seven!"

10131{_}338{_}Hark!
10131{_}339{_}the honey bee is humming; See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky, And the gnats are on the wing Wheeling round in airy ring.
10131{_}340{_}Listen!
10131{_}341{_}New-born lambs are bleating, And the cawing rooks are meeting In the elms--a noisy crowd.
10131{_}342{_}All the birds are singing loud, And the first white butterfly In the sunshine dances by.
10131{_}343{_}Look around you, look around!
10131{_}344{_}Flowers in all the fields abound, Every running stream is bright, All the orchard trees are white, And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet autumn fruit.
10131{_}345{_}BIRDS IN SUMMER  How pleasant the life of a bird must be, Flitting about in each leafy tree; In the leafy trees so broad and tall, Like a green and beautiful palace hall, With its airy chambers light and boon, That open to sun and stars and moon; That open to the bright blue sky, And the frolicsome winds as they wander by.
10131{_}346{_}They have left their nests on the forest bough; Those homes of delight they need not now; And the young and the old they wander out, And traverse their green world round about; And hark!
10131{_}347{_}at the top of this leafy hall, How one to the other in love they call!
10131{_}348{_}"Come up!
10131{_}349{_}Come up!"
10131{_}350{_}they seem to say, "Where the topmost twigs in the breezes sway."
10131{_}351{_}"Come up!
10131{_}352{_}come up!
10131{_}353{_}for the world is fair Where the merry leaves dance in the summer air."
10131{_}354{_}And the birds below give back the cry, "We come, we come to the branches high."
10131{_}355{_}How pleasant the lives of the birds must be, Living in love in a leafy tree!
10131{_}356{_}And away through the air what joy to go, And to look on the green, bright earth below!
10131{_}357{_}How pleasant the life of a bird must be, Skimming about on the breezy sea, Cresting the billows like silvery foam, Then wheeling away to its cliff-built home!
10131{_}358{_}What joy it must be to sail, upborne, By a strong free wing, through the rosy morn, To meet the young sun, face to face, And pierce, like a shaft, the boundless space!
10131{_}359{_}To pass through the bowers of the silver cloud; To sing in the thunder hall aloud; To spread out the wings for a wild, free flight With the upper cloud-wings,--oh, what delight!
10131{_}360{_}Oh, what would I give, like a bird, to go, Right on through the arch of the sun-lit bow, And see how the water-drops are kissed Into green and yellow and amethyst.
10131{_}361{_}How pleasant the life of a bird must be, Wherever it listeth, there to flee; To go, when a joyful fancy calls, Dashing down 'mong the waterfalls; Then wheeling about, with its mate at play, Above and below, and among the spray, Hither and thither, with screams as wild As the laughing mirth of a rosy child.
10131{_}362{_}What joy it must be, like a living breeze, To flutter about 'mid the flowering trees;  Lightly to soar, and to see beneath, The wastes of the blossoming purple heath, And the yellow furze, like fields of gold, That gladdened some fairy region old!
10131{_}363{_}On the mountain tops, on the billowy sea, On the leafy stems of a forest tree, How pleasant the life of a bird must be!
10131{_}364{_}THE SPIDER AND THE FLY   "Will you walk into my parlor?"
10131{_}365{_}Said a spider to a fly; "'Tis the prettiest little parlor   That ever you did spy.
10131{_}366{_}The way into my parlor   Is up a winding stair, And I have many pretty things   To show you when you're there."
10131{_}367{_}"O no, no," said the little fly,   "To ask me is in vain; For who goes up your winding stair   Can ne'er come down again."
10131{_}368{_}"I'm sure you must be weary   With soaring up so high; Will you rest upon my little bed?"
10131{_}369{_}Said the spider to the fly.
10131{_}370{_}"There are pretty curtains drawn around;   The sheets are fine and thin; And if you like to rest awhile,   I'll snugly tuck you in."
10131{_}371{_}"O no, no," said the little fly,   "For I've often heard it said They never, never wake again,   Who sleep upon your bed."
10131{_}372{_}Said the cunning spider to the fly,   "Dear friend, what shall I do To prove the warm affection   I've always felt for you?
10131{_}373{_}I have, within my pantry,   Good store of all that's nice; I'm sure you're very welcome--   Will you please to take a slice?"
10131{_}374{_}"O no, no," said the little fly,   "Kind sir, that cannot be; I've heard what's in your pantry,   And I do not wish to see."
10131{_}375{_}"Sweet creature," said the spider,   "You're witty and you're wise; How handsome are your gauzy wings,   How brilliant are your eyes.
10131{_}376{_}I have a little looking-glass   Upon my parlor shelf; If you'll step in one moment, dear,   You shall behold yourself."
10131{_}377{_}"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,   "For what you're pleased to say, And bidding you good-morning now,   I'll call another day."
10131{_}378{_}The spider turned him round about,   And went into his den, For well he knew the silly fly   Would soon be back again; So he wove a subtle web   In a little corner sly, And set his table ready   To dine upon the fly.
10131{_}379{_}He went out to his door again,   And merrily did sing, "Come hither, hither, pretty fly,   With pearl and silver wing; Your robes are green and purple,   There's a crest upon your head; Your eyes are like the diamond bright,   But mine are dull as lead."
10131{_}380{_}Alas, alas!
10131{_}381{_}how very soon   This silly little fly, Hearing his wily, flattering words,   Came slowly flitting by; With buzzing wings she hung aloft,   Then near and nearer drew-- Thought only of her brilliant eyes,   And green and purple hue; Thought only of her crested head--   Poor foolish thing!
10131{_}382{_}At last Up jumped the cunning spider,   And fiercely held her fast.
10131{_}383{_}He dragged her up his winding stair,   Into his dismal den Within his little parlor--but   She ne'er came out again!
10131{_}384{_}And now, dear little children   Who may this story read, To idle, silly, flattering words,   I pray you, ne'er give heed.
10131{_}385{_}Unto an evil counselor   Close heart and ear and eye; And take a lesson from this tale   Of the spider and the fly.
10131{_}386{_}THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON LOW  "And where have you been, my Mary,   And where have you been from me?"
10131{_}387{_}"I've been to the top of the Caldon Low,   The midsummer night to see!"
10131{_}388{_}"And what did you see, my Mary,   All up on the Caldon Low?"
10131{_}389{_}"I saw the glad sunshine come down,   And I saw the merry winds blow."
10131{_}390{_}"And what did you hear, my Mary,   All up on the Caldon Hill?"
10131{_}391{_}"I heard the drops of the water made,   And the ears of the green corn fill."
10131{_}392{_}"Oh!
10131{_}393{_}tell me all, my Mary--   All, all that ever you know; For you must have seen the fairies   Last night on the Caldon Low."
10131{_}394{_}"Then take me on your knee, mother;   And listen, mother of mine: A hundred fairies danced last night.
10131{_}395{_}And the harpers they were nine;  "And their harp-strings rung so merrily   To their dancing feet so small; But oh!
10131{_}396{_}the words of their talking   Were merrier far than all."
10131{_}397{_}"And what were the words, my Mary,   That then you heard them say?"
10131{_}398{_}"I'll tell you all, my mother;   But let me have my way.
10131{_}399{_}"Some of them play'd with the water,   And roll'd it down the hill; 'And this,' they said, 'shall speedily turn   The poor old miller's mill;  "'For there has been no water   Ever since the first of May; And a busy man will the miller be   At dawning of the day.
10131{_}400{_}"'Oh!
10131{_}401{_}the miller, how he will laugh   When he sees the mill-dam rise!
10131{_}402{_}The jolly old miller, how he will laugh   Till the tears fill both his eyes!'
10131{_}403{_}"And some they seized the little winds   That sounded over the hill; And each put a horn unto his mouth,   And blew both loud and shrill;  "'And there,' they said, 'the merry winds go   Away from every horn; And they shall clear the mildew dank   From the blind old widow's corn.
10131{_}404{_}"'Oh!
10131{_}405{_}the poor, blind widow,   Though she has been blind so long, She'll be blithe enough when the mildew's gone,   And the corn stands tall and strong,'  "And some they brought the brown lint-seed,   And flung it down from the Low; 'And this!'
10131{_}406{_}they said, 'by the sunrise,   In the weaver's croft shall grow.
10131{_}407{_}"'Oh!
10131{_}408{_}the poor, lame weaver,   How he will laugh outright When he sees his dwindling flax-field   All full of flowers by night!'
10131{_}409{_}"And then outspoke a brownie,   With a long beard on his chin; 'I have spun up all the tow,' said he,   'And I want some more to spin.
10131{_}410{_}"'I've spun a piece of hempen cloth,   And I want to spin another; A little sheet for Mary's bed,   And an apron for her mother.'
10131{_}411{_}"With that I could not help but laugh,   And I laugh'd out loud and free; And then on the top of the Caldon Low   There was no one left but me.
10131{_}412{_}"And all on the top of the Caldon Low   The mists were cold and gray, And nothing I saw but the mossy stones   That round about me lay.
10131{_}413{_}"But, coming down from the hill-top,   I heard afar below, How busy the jolly miller was,   And how the wheel did go.
10131{_}414{_}"And I peep'd into the widow's field,   And, sure enough, were seen The yellow ears of the mildew'd corn,   All standing stout and green.
10131{_}415{_}"And down by the weaver's croft I stole,   To see if the flax were sprung; And I met the weaver at his gate,   With the good news on his tongue.
10131{_}416{_}"Now this is all I heard, mother,   And all that I did see; So, pr'ythee, make my bed, mother,   For I'm tired as I can be."
10131{_}417{_}OLD CHRISTMAS  Now he who knows old Christmas,   He knows a carle of worth; For he is as good a fellow   As any upon earth.
10131{_}418{_}He comes warm cloaked and coated,   And buttoned up to the chin; And soon as he comes a-nigh the door   We open and let him in.
10131{_}419{_}And with sprigs of holly and ivy   We make the house look gay, Just out of an old regard for him,   For it was his ancient way.
10131{_}420{_}He must be a rich old fellow,   What money he gives away!
10131{_}421{_}There is not a lord in England   Could equal him any day.
10131{_}422{_}Good luck unto old Christmas,   And long life, let us sing, For he doth more good unto the poor   Than many a crowned king.

10131{_}424{_}"Mistress Hen," says the pig,   "Don't you be quite so big!"
10131{_}425{_}And he gave her a push with his snout.
10131{_}426{_}"You are rough, and you're fat,   But who cares for all that; I will stay if I choose," says the hen.
10131{_}427{_}"No, mistress, no longer!"
10131{_}428{_}Says pig, "I'm the stronger, And mean to be boss of my pen!"
10131{_}429{_}Then the hen cackled out   Just as close to his snout As she dare: "You're an ill-natured brute,   And if I had the corn,   Just as sure as I'm born, I would send you to starve or to root!"
10131{_}430{_}"But you don't own the cribs;   So I think that my ribs Will be never the leaner for you:   This trough is my trough,   And the sooner you're off," Says the pig, "why the better you'll do!"
10131{_}431{_}"You're not a bit fair,   And you're cross as a bear; What harm do I do in your pen?
10131{_}432{_}But a pig is a pig,   And I don't care a fig For the worst you can say," says the hen.
10131{_}433{_}Says the pig, "You will care   If I act like a bear And tear your two wings from your neck,"   "What a nice little pen   You have got!"
10131{_}434{_}says the hen, Beginning to scratch and to peck.
10131{_}435{_}Now the pig stood amazed   And the bristles, upraised A moment past, fell down so sleek.
10131{_}436{_}"Neighbor Biddy," says he,   "If you'll just allow me, I will show you a nice place to pick!"
10131{_}437{_}So she followed him off,   And they ate from one trough--  They had quarreled for nothing, they saw;   And when they had fed,   "Neighbor Hen," the pig said, "Won't you stay here and roost in my straw?"
10131{_}438{_}"No, I thank you; you see   That I sleep in a tree," Says the hen; "but I _must_ go away;   So a grateful good-by."
10131{_}439{_}"Make your home in my sty," Says the pig, "and come in every day."
10131{_}440{_}Now my child will not miss   The true moral of this Little story of anger and strife;   For a word spoken soft   Will turn enemies oft Into friends that will stay friends for life.
10131{_}441{_}A LESSON OF MERCY  A boy named Peter  Found once in the road All harmless and helpless,  A poor little toad;  And ran to his playmate,  And all out of breath Cried, "John, come and help,  And we'll stone him to death!"
10131{_}442{_}And picking up stones,  The two went on the run, Saying, one to the other,  "Oh, won't we have fun?"
10131{_}443{_}Thus primed and all ready,  They'd got nearly back, When a donkey came  Dragging a cart on the track.
10131{_}444{_}Now the cart was as much  As the donkey could draw, And he came with his head  Hanging down; so he saw,  All harmless and helpless,  The poor little toad, A-taking his morning nap  Right in the road.
10131{_}445{_}He shivered at first,  Then he drew back his leg, And set up his ears,  Never moving a peg.
10131{_}446{_}Then he gave the poor toad,  With his warm nose a dump, And he woke and got off  With a hop and jump.
10131{_}447{_}And then with an eye  Turned on Peter and John, And hanging his homely head  Down, he went on.
10131{_}448{_}"We can't kill him now, John,"  Says Peter, "that's flat, In the face of an eye and  An action like that!"
10131{_}449{_}"For my part, I haven't  The heart to," says John; "But the load is too heavy  That donkey has on:  "Let's help him"; so both lads  Set off with a will And came up with the cart  At the foot of the hill.
10131{_}450{_}And when each a shoulder  Had put to the wheel, They helped the poor donkey  A wonderful deal.
10131{_}451{_}When they got to the top  Back again they both run, Agreeing they never  Had had better fun.
10131{_}452{_}NOVEMBER  The leaves are fading and falling,   The winds are rough and wild, The birds have ceased their calling,   But let me tell you, my child,  Though day by day, as it closes,   Doth darker and colder grow, The roots of the bright red roses   Will keep alive in the snow.
10131{_}453{_}And when the winter is over,   The boughs will get new leaves, The quail come back to the clover,   And the swallow back to the eaves.
10131{_}454{_}The robin will wear on his bosom   A vest that is bright and new, And the loveliest wayside blossom   Will shine with the sun and dew.
10131{_}455{_}The leaves to-day are whirling,   The brooks are all dry and dumb, But let me tell you, my darling,   The spring will be sure to come.
10131{_}456{_}There must be rough, cold weather,   And winds and rains so wild; Not all good things together   Come to us here, my child.
10131{_}457{_}So, when some dear joy loses   Its beauteous summer glow, Think how the roots of the roses   Are kept alive in the snow.
10131{_}458{_}LITTLE GOTTLIEB  Across the German Ocean,   In a country far from our own, Once, a poor little boy, named Gottlieb,   Lived with his mother alone.
10131{_}459{_}They dwelt in the part of a village   Where the houses were poor and small, But the home of little Gottlieb,   Was the poorest one of all  He was not large enough to work,   And his mother could do no more (Though she scarcely laid her knitting down)   Than keep the wolf from the door.
10131{_}460{_}She had to take their threadbare clothes,   And turn, and patch, and darn; For never any woman yet   Grew rich by knitting yarn.
10131{_}461{_}And oft at night, beside her chair,   Would Gottlieb sit, and plan The wonderful things he would do for her,   When he grew to be a man.
10131{_}462{_}One night she sat and knitted,  And Gottlieb sat and dreamed, When a happy fancy all at once  Upon his vision beamed.
10131{_}463{_}'Twas only a week till Christmas,  And Gottlieb knew that then The Christ-child, who was born that day,  Sent down good gifts to men.
10131{_}464{_}But he said, "He will never find us,  Our home is so mean and small.
10131{_}465{_}And we, who have most need of them,  Will get no gifts at all."
10131{_}466{_}When all at once a happy light  Came into his eyes so blue, And lighted up his face with smiles,  As he thought what he could do.
10131{_}467{_}Next day when the postman's letters  Came from all over the land; Came one for the Christ-child, written  In a child's poor trembling hand.
10131{_}468{_}You may think he was sorely puzzled  What in the world to do; So he went to the Burgomaster,  As the wisest man he knew.
10131{_}469{_}And when they opened the letter,   They stood almost dismayed That such a little child should dare   To ask the Lord for aid.
10131{_}470{_}Then the Burgomaster stammered,   And scarce knew what to speak, And hastily he brushed aside   A drop, like a tear, from his cheek.
10131{_}471{_}Then up he spoke right gruffly,   And turned himself about: "This must be a very foolish boy,   And a small one, too, no doubt."
10131{_}472{_}But when six rosy children   That night about him pressed, Poor, trusting little Gottlieb   Stood near him, with the rest.
10131{_}473{_}And he heard his simple, touching prayer,   Through all their noisy play; Though he tried his very best to put   The thought of him away.
10131{_}474{_}A wise and learned man was he,   Men called him good and just; But his wisdom seemed like foolishness,   By that weak child's simple trust.
10131{_}475{_}Now when the morn of Christmas came   And the long, long week was done, Poor Gottlieb, who scarce could sleep,   Rose up before the sun,  And hastened to his mother,   But he scarce might speak for fear, When he saw her wondering look, and saw   The Burgomaster near.
10131{_}476{_}He wasn't afraid of the Holy Babe,   Nor his mother, meek and mild; But he felt as if so great a man   Had never been a child.
10131{_}477{_}Amazed the poor child looked, to find   The hearth was piled with wood, And the table, never full before,   Was heaped with dainty food.
10131{_}478{_}Then half to hide from himself the truth   The Burgomaster said, While the mother blessed him on her knees,   And Gottlieb shook for dread;  "Nay, give no thanks, my good dame,   To such as me for aid, Be grateful to your little son,   And the Lord to whom he prayed!"
10131{_}479{_}Then turning round to Gottlieb,  "Your written prayer, you see, Came not to whom it was addressed,  It only came to me!
10131{_}480{_}"'Twas but a foolish thing you did,  As you must understand; For though the gifts are yours, you know,  You have them from my hand."
10131{_}481{_}Then Gottlieb answered fearlessly,  Where he humbly stood apart, "But the Christ-child sent them all the same,  He put the thought in your heart!"
10131{_}482{_}OUR HEROES  Here's a hand to the boy who has courage  To do what he knows to be right; When he falls in the way of temptation,  He has a hard battle to fight.
10131{_}483{_}Who strives against self and his comrades  Will find a most powerful foe; All honor to him if he conquers--  A cheer for the boy who says "No!"
10131{_}484{_}There's many a battle fought daily  The world knows nothing about; There's many a brave little soldier  Whose strength puts a legion to rout.
10131{_}485{_}And he who fights sin single-handed   Is more of a hero, I say, Than he who leads soldiers to battle,   And conquers by arms in the fray.
10131{_}486{_}Be steadfast, my boy, when you're tempted   And do what you know to be right; Stand firm by the colors of manhood,   And you will overcome in the fight.

10131{_}489{_}Touch them with your rosy fingers,   Wake them with your pleasant tread, Push away the leaf-brown covers,   Over all their faces spread;  Tell them how the sun is waiting   Longer daily in the skies, Looking for the bright uplifting   Of their softly-fringed eyes.
10131{_}490{_}Call the crow-foot and the crocus,   Call the pale anemone, Call the violet and the daisy,   Clothed with careful modesty; Seek the low and humble blossoms,   Of their beauties unaware, Let the dandelion and fennel,   Show their shining yellow hair.
10131{_}491{_}Bid the little homely sparrows   Chirping, in the cold and rain, Their impatient sweet complaining,   Sing out from their hearts again; Bid them set themselves to mating,   Cooing love in softest words, Crowd their nests, all cold and empty,   Full of little callow birds.
10131{_}492{_}Come up, April, through the valley,   Where the fountain sleeps to-day, Let him, freed from icy fetters,   Go rejoicing on his way; Through the flower-enameled meadows   Let him run his laughing race, Making love to all the blossoms   That o'erlean and kiss his face.

10131{_}503{_}Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,   And they trimm'd the lamps as the sun went down; They look'd at the squall, and they look'd at the shower,   And the night-rack came rolling up, ragged and brown; But men must work, and women must weep, Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,     And the harbor bar be moaning.
10131{_}504{_}Three corpses lay out on the shining sands   In the morning gleam as the tide went down, And the women are weeping and wringing their hands   For those who will never come home to the town; For men must work, and women must weep-- And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep--     And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.

10131{_}513{_}Each day my steps grow slow, grow light, As through the woods I reverent creep, Watching all things lie "down to sleep."
10131{_}514{_}I never knew before what beds, Fragrant to smell, and soft to touch, The forest sifts and shapes and spreads; I never knew before how much Of human sound there is in such Low tones as through the forest sweep, When all wild things lie "down to sleep."
10131{_}515{_}Each day I find new coverlids Tucked in, and more sweet eyes shut tight; Sometimes the viewless mother bids Her ferns kneel down full in my sight; I hear their chorus of "good-night"; And half I smile, and half I weep, Listening while they lie "down to sleep."
10131{_}516{_}November woods are bare and still; November days are bright and good; Life's noon burns up life's morning chill; Life's night rests feet which long have stood; Some warm soft bed, in field or wood, The mother will not fail to keep, Where we can "lay us down to sleep."

10131{_}520{_}O suns and skies and flowers of June,   Count all your boasts together, Love loveth best of all the year   October's bright blue weather.

10131{_}522{_}And round about her sailing,   The sea was sparkling white, The waves all clapped their hands and sang   To see so fair a sight.
10131{_}523{_}They kissed her twice, they kissed her thrice,   And murmured with delight.
10131{_}524{_}Then came the gallant captain,   And stood upon the deck; In velvet coat, and ruffles white,   Without a spot or speck; And diamond rings, and triple strings   Of pearls around his neck.
10131{_}525{_}And four-and-twenty sailors   Were round him bowing low; On every jacket three times three   Gold buttons in a row; And cutlasses down to their knees;   They made a goodly show.
10131{_}526{_}And then the ship went sailing,   A-sailing o'er the sea; She dived beyond the setting sun,   But never back came she, For she found the lands of the golden sands,   Where the pearls and diamonds be.

10131{_}530{_}Rocks and castles towering high;   Hills and dales, and streams and fields; And knights in armor riding by,   With nodding plumes and shining shields.
10131{_}531{_}And here are little boats, and there   Big ships with sails spread to the breeze; And yonder, palm trees waving fair   On islands set in silver seas,  And butterflies with gauzy wings;   And herds of cows and flocks of sheep; And fruit and flowers and all the things   You see when you are sound asleep.
10131{_}532{_}For, creeping softly underneath   The door when all the lights are out, Jack Frost takes every breath you breathe,   And knows the things you think about.

10131{_}536{_}The linnets play among the leaves   At hide-and-seek, and chirp and sing; While, flashing to and from the eaves,   The swallows twitter on the wing.
10131{_}537{_}The twigs that shake, and boughs that sway;   And tall old trees you could not climb; And winds that come, but cannot stay,   Are singing gaily all the time.

10131{_}635{_}_Thomas Bailey Aldrich._   KRISS KRINGLE  Just as the moon was fading   Amid her misty rings, And every stocking was stuffed   With childhood's precious things,  Old Kriss Kringle looked around,   And saw on the elm-tree bough, High hung, an oriole's nest,   Lonely and empty now.
10131{_}636{_}"Quite a stocking," he laughed,   "Hung up there on a tree!
10131{_}637{_}I didn't suppose the birds   Expected a present from me!"
10131{_}638{_}Then old Kriss Kringle, who loves   A joke as well as the best, Dropped a handful of snowflakes   Into the oriole's empty nest.

10131{_}640{_}Little by little, each day it grew; Little by little, it sipped the dew; Downward it sent out a thread-like root; Up in the air sprung a tiny shoot.
10131{_}641{_}Day after day, and year after year, Little by little the leaves appear; And the slender branches spread far and wide, Till the mighty oak is the forest's pride.
10131{_}642{_}Far down in the depths of the dark blue sea, An insect train work ceaselessly.
10131{_}643{_}Grain by grain, they are building well, Each one alone in its little cell.
10131{_}644{_}Moment by moment, and day by day, Never stopping to rest or to play, Rocks upon rocks, they are rearing high, Till the top looks out on the sunny sky.
10131{_}645{_}The gentle wind and the balmy air, Little by little, bring verdure there; Till the summer sunbeams gayly smile On the buds and the flowers of the coral isle.
10131{_}646{_}"Little by little," said a thoughtful boy, "Moment by moment, I'll well employ, Learning a little every day, And not spending all my time in play.
10131{_}647{_}And still this rule in my mind shall dwell, _Whatever I do, I will do it well._  "Little by little, I'll learn to know The treasured wisdom of long ago; And one of these days, perhaps, we'll see That the world will be the better for me"; And do you not think that this simple plan Made him a wise and useful man?

10131{_}649{_}Hand in hand let's dance around, For this place is fairy ground.
10131{_}650{_}When mortals are at rest,   And snoring in their nest,   Unheard and unespied,   Through keyholes we do glide; Over tables, stools, and shelves, We trip it with our fairy elves.
10131{_}651{_}And if the house be foul   With platter, dish, or bowl,   Upstairs we nimbly creep,   And find the sluts asleep; There we pinch their arms and thighs-- None escapes, nor none espies.
10131{_}652{_}But if the house be swept,   And from uncleanness kept,   We praise the household maid,   And duly she is paid; For we use, before we go, To drop a tester in her shoe.
10131{_}653{_}Upon a mushroom's head   Our tablecloth we spread;   A grain of rye or wheat   Is manchet, which we eat; Pearly drops of dew we drink, In acorn cups, fil'd to the brink.
10131{_}654{_}The brains of nightingales,   With unctuous fat of snails,   Between two cockles stew'd,   Is meat that's easily chew'd; Tails of worms, and marrow of mice, Do make a dish that's wondrous nice.
10131{_}655{_}The grasshopper, gnat, and fly,   Serve us for our minstrelsy;   Grace said, we dance a while,   And so the time beguile; And if the moon doth hide her head, The glow-worm lights us home to bed.
10131{_}656{_}On tops of dewy grass   So nimbly do we pass,   The young and tender stalk   Ne'er bends when we do walk; Yet in the morning may be seen Where we the night before have been.

10131{_}658{_}Yet he dried up the snow-banks far and near,   And made the snow-clouds roll, Huddled up in a heap, like driven sheep,   Way off to the cold North Pole.
10131{_}659{_}He broke the ice on the river's back   And floated it down the tide, And the wild ducks came with a loud "Quack, quack,"   To play in the waters wide.
10131{_}660{_}He snatched the hat off Johnny's head   And rolled it on and on, And oh, what a merry chase it led   Little laughing and scampering John!
10131{_}661{_}He swung the tree where the squirrel lay   Too late in its winter bed, And he seemed to say in his jolly way,   "Wake up, little sleepy head!"
10131{_}662{_}He dried the yard so that Rob and Ted   Could play at marbles there, And he painted their cheeks a carmine red   With the greatest skill and care.
10131{_}663{_}He shook all the clothes-lines, one by one,   What a busy time he had!
10131{_}664{_}But nobody thanked him for all he had done;   Now wasn't that just too bad?

10131{_}667{_}Such spreading of rootlets far and wide,   Such whispering to and fro; And, "Are you ready?"
10131{_}668{_}the Snowdrop asked,   "'Tis time to start, you know."
10131{_}669{_}"Almost, my dear," the Scilla replied;   "I'll follow as soon as you go."
10131{_}670{_}Then, "Ha!
10131{_}671{_}ha!
10131{_}672{_}ha!"
10131{_}673{_}a chorus came   Of laughter soft and low, From the millions of flowers under the ground--   Yes--millions--beginning to grow.
10131{_}674{_}"I'll promise my blossoms," the Crocus said,   "When I hear the bluebirds sing."
10131{_}675{_}And straight thereafter, Narcissus cried,   "My silver and gold I'll bring."
10131{_}676{_}"And ere they are dulled," another spoke,   "The Hyacinth bells shall ring."
10131{_}677{_}And the Violet only murmured, "I'm here,"   And sweet grew the air of spring.

10131{_}681{_}a chorus came   Of laughter soft and low, From the millions of flowers under the ground--   Yes--millions--beginning to grow.

10131{_}683{_}through the coldest days,   Imprisoned in walls of brown, They never lost heart though the blast shrieked loud,   And the sleet and the hail came down, But patiently each wrought her beautiful dress,   Or fashioned her beautiful crown; And now they are coming to brighten the world,   Still shadowed by Winter's frown; And well may they cheerily laugh, "Ha!
10131{_}684{_}ha!"
10131{_}685{_}In a chorus soft and low, The millions of flowers hid under the ground--   Yes--millions--beginning to grow.
10131{_}686{_}_Anonymous._   THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER  The sun was shining on the sea,   Shining with all his might: He did his very best to make   The billows smooth and bright-- And this was odd, because it was   The middle of the night.
10131{_}687{_}The moon was shining sulkily,   Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there   After the day was done-- "It's very rude of him," she said,   "To come and spoil the fun!"
10131{_}688{_}The sea was wet as wet could be,   The sands were dry as dry.
10131{_}689{_}You could not see a cloud, because   No cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying overhead--   There were no birds to fly.
10131{_}690{_}The Walrus and the Carpenter   Were walking close at hand: They wept like anything to see   Such quantities of sand: "If this were only cleared away,"   They said, "It would be grand!"
10131{_}691{_}"If seven maids with seven mops   Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose," the Walrus said,   "That they could get it clear?"
10131{_}692{_}"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,   And shed a bitter tear.
10131{_}693{_}"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
10131{_}694{_}The Walrus did beseech.
10131{_}695{_}"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,   Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four,   To give a hand to each."
10131{_}696{_}The eldest Oyster looked at him,   But never a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye,   And shook his heavy head-- Meaning to say he did not choose   To leave the oyster-bed.
10131{_}697{_}But four young Oysters hurried up,   All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,   Their shoes were clean and neat-- And this was odd, because, you know,   They hadn't any feet.
10131{_}698{_}Four other Oysters followed them   And yet another four; And thick and fast they came at last,   And more, and more, and more-- All hopping through the frothy waves,   And scrambling to the shore.
10131{_}699{_}The Walrus and the Carpenter   Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock   Conveniently low: And all the little Oysters stood   And waited in a row.
10131{_}700{_}"The time has come," the Walrus said,   "To talk of many things: Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--   Of cabbages--and kings-- And why the sea is boiling hot--   And whether pigs have wings."
10131{_}701{_}"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,   "Before we have our chat; For some of us are out of breath,   And all of us are fat!"
10131{_}702{_}"No hurry!"
10131{_}703{_}said the Carpenter.
10131{_}704{_}They thanked him much for that  "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,   "Is what we chiefly need: Pepper and vinegar besides   Are very good indeed-- Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,   We can begin to feed."
10131{_}705{_}"But not on us!"
10131{_}706{_}the Oysters cried,   Turning a little blue.
10131{_}707{_}"After such kindness, that would be   A dismal thing to do!"
10131{_}708{_}"The night is fine," the Walrus said,   "Do you admire the view?
10131{_}709{_}"It was so kind of you to come!
10131{_}710{_}And you are very nice!"
10131{_}711{_}The Carpenter said nothing but   "Cut us another slice.
10131{_}712{_}I wish you were not quite so deaf--   I've had to ask you twice!"
10131{_}713{_}"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,   "To play them such a trick.
10131{_}714{_}After we've brought them out so far,   And made them trot so quick!"
10131{_}715{_}The Carpenter said nothing but   "The butter's spread too thick!"
10131{_}716{_}"I weep for you," the Walrus said:   "I deeply sympathize."
10131{_}717{_}With sobs and tears he sorted out   Those of the largest size, Holding his pocket-handkerchief   Before his streaming eyes.
10131{_}718{_}"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,   "You've had a pleasant run!
10131{_}719{_}Shall we be trotting home again?"
10131{_}720{_}But answer came there none-- And this was scarcely odd, because   They'd eaten every one.

10131{_}723{_}See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all        advance!
10131{_}724{_}They are waiting on the shingle--will you come        and join the dance?
10131{_}725{_}Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will        you join the dance?

10131{_}727{_}"You can really have no notion how delightful       it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the       lobsters, out to sea!"
10131{_}728{_}But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!"
10131{_}729{_}and       gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he       would not join the dance.
10131{_}730{_}Would not, could not, would not, could not,       would not join the dance.
10131{_}731{_}Would not, could not, would not, could not, could       not join the dance.
10131{_}732{_}"What matters it how far we go?"
10131{_}733{_}his scaly       friend replied, "There is another shore, you know, upon the       other side.
10131{_}734{_}The further off from England the nearer is to       France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and       join the dance.

10131{_}738{_}Within the churchyard he is seen,   Beside the headstones peeping, And shining like a golden star   O'er some still form there sleeping; Beside the house door oft he springs,   In all his wanton straying, And children shout in laughing glee   To find him in their playing.
10131{_}739{_}At eve he dons his nightgown green,   And goes to bed right early, At morn, he spreads his yellow skirts   To catch the dewdrops pearly; A darling elf is Dandelion,   A roguish wanton sweeting; Yet he is loved by ev'ry child,   All give him joyous greeting.

10131{_}742{_}Farewell, green fields and happy grove,   Where flocks have ta'en delight; Where lambs have nibbled, silent move   The feet of angels bright;     Unseen they pour blessing,     And joy without ceasing,     On each bud and blossom,     And each sleeping bosom.
10131{_}743{_}They look in every thoughtless nest   Where birds are cover'd warm, They visit caves of every beast,   To keep them all from harm:--     If they see any weeping     That should have been sleeping     They pour sleep on their head,     And sit down by their bed.

10131{_}807{_}We careless folk the deed forgot;   Till one day, idly walking, We marked upon the self-same spot   A crowd of veterans, talking.
10131{_}808{_}They shook their trembling heads and gray,   With pride and noiseless laughter, When, well-a-day!
10131{_}809{_}they blew away,   And ne'er were heard of after.
10131{_}810{_}_Helen Gray Cone._   A FAIRY TALE  There stands by the wood-path shaded   A meek little beggar maid; Close under her mantle faded   She is hidden like one afraid.
10131{_}811{_}Yet if you but lifted lightly   That mantle of russet brown, She would spring up slender and sightly,   In a smoke-blue silken gown.
10131{_}812{_}For she is a princess, fated,   Disguised in the wood to dwell, And all her life long has awaited   The touch that should break the spell;  And the Oak, that has cast around her   His root like a wrinkled arm, Is the wild old wizard that bound her   Fast with his cruel charm.
10131{_}813{_}Is the princess worth your knowing?
10131{_}814{_}Then haste, for the spring is brief, And find the Hepatica growing,   Hid under a last year's leaf!
10131{_}815{_}_Helen Gray Cone._   A FABLE  The mountain and the squirrel Had a quarrel, And the former called the latter "Little Prig"; Bun replied, "You are doubtless very big; But all sorts of things and weather Must be taken in together, To make up a year And a sphere.
10131{_}816{_}And I think it no disgrace To occupy my place.
10131{_}817{_}If I'm not so large as you You are not so small as I, And not half so spry.
10131{_}818{_}I'll not deny you make A very pretty squirrel track; Talents differ; all is well and wisely put; If I cannot carry forests on my back, Neither can you crack a nut."
10131{_}819{_}_Ralph Waldo Emerson._   THE NIGHT WIND  Have you ever heard the wind go "Yooooo"?
10131{_}820{_}'Tis a pitiful sound to hear!
10131{_}821{_}It seems to chill you through and through   With a strange and speechless fear.
10131{_}822{_}'Tis the voice of the night that broods outside   When folk should be asleep, And many and many's the time I've cried To the darkness brooding far and wide   Over the land and the deep:   "Whom do you want, O lonely night,   That you wail the long hours through?"
10131{_}823{_}And the night would say in its ghostly way:                 "Yoooooooo!
10131{_}824{_}Yoooooooo!
10131{_}825{_}Yoooooooo!"
10131{_}826{_}My mother told me long ago   (When I was a little tad) That when the night went wailing so,   Somebody had been bad;  And then, when I was snug in bed,   Whither I had been sent, With the blankets pulled up round my head, I'd think of what my mother'd said,   And wonder what boy she meant!
10131{_}827{_}And "Who's been bad to-day?"
10131{_}828{_}I'd ask   Of the wind that hoarsely blew; And the voice would say in its meaningful way:                 "Yoooooooo!
10131{_}829{_}Yoooooooo!
10131{_}830{_}Yoooooooo!"
10131{_}831{_}That this was true I must allow--   You'll not believe it, though!
10131{_}832{_}Yes, though I'm quite a model now,   I was not always so.
10131{_}833{_}And if you doubt what things I say,   Suppose you make the test; Suppose, when you've been bad some day And up to bed are sent away   From mother and the rest--   Suppose you ask, "Who has been bad?"
10131{_}834{_}And then you'll hear what's true; For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone:                 "Yoooooooo!
10131{_}835{_}Yoooooooo!
10131{_}836{_}Yoooooooo!"
10131{_}837{_}_Eugene Field._   DON'T KILL THE BIRDS  Don't kill the birds, the pretty birds   That sing about your door, Soon as the joyous spring has come   And chilling storms are o'er.
10131{_}838{_}The little birds, how sweet they sing!
10131{_}839{_}Oh, let them joyous live, And never seek to take the life   That you can never give!
10131{_}840{_}Don't kill the birds, the pretty birds   That play among the trees; 'Twould make the earth a cheerless place   Should we dispense with these.
10131{_}841{_}The little birds, how fond they play!

10131{_}843{_}Don't kill the birds, the happy birds,   That bless the fields and grove; So innocent to look upon,   They claim our warmest love.
10131{_}844{_}The happy birds, the tuneful birds,   How pleasant 'tis to see!

10131{_}847{_}Colesworthy._    A THANKSGIVING FABLE  It was a hungry pussy cat, upon Thanksgiving morn, And she watched a thankful little mouse, that ate an ear of corn.
10131{_}848{_}"If I ate that thankful little mouse, how thankful he should be, When he has made a meal himself, to make a meal for me!
10131{_}849{_}"Then with his thanks for having fed, and his thanks for feeding me, With all _his_ thankfulness inside, how thankful I shall be!"
10131{_}850{_}Thus mused the hungry pussy cat, upon Thanksgiving Day; But the little mouse had overheard and declined (with thanks) to stay.
10131{_}851{_}_Oliver Herford._   THE BALLAD OF THE TEMPEST  We were crowded in the cabin,   Not a soul would dare to sleep,-- It was midnight on the waters,   And a storm was on the deep.
10131{_}852{_}'Tis a fearful thing in winter   To be shattered by the blast, And to hear the rattling trumpet   Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"
10131{_}853{_}So we shuddered there in silence,--   For the stoutest held his breath, While the hungry sea was roaring   And the breakers talked with Death.
10131{_}854{_}As thus we sat in darkness,   Each one busy with his prayers, "We are lost!"
10131{_}855{_}the captain shouted,   As he staggered down the stairs.
10131{_}856{_}But his little daughter whispered,   As she took his icy hand, "Isn't God upon the ocean,   Just the same as on the land?"
10131{_}857{_}Then we kissed the little maiden,   And we spoke in better cheer, And we anchored safe in harbor,   When the morn was shining clear.
10131{_}858{_}_James T. Fields._   A CHILD'S PRAYER  God make my life a little light,   Within the world to glow,-- A tiny flame that burneth bright,   Wherever I may go.
10131{_}859{_}God make my life a little flower,   That giveth joy to all;-- Content to bloom in native bower   Although its place be small.
10131{_}860{_}God make my life a little song,   That comforteth the sad; That helpeth others to be strong,   And makes the singer glad.
10131{_}861{_}God make my life a little staff   Whereon the weak may rest,-- That so what health and strength I have   May serve my neighbor best.
10131{_}862{_}God make my life a little hymn   Of tenderness and praise,-- Of faith, that never waxeth dim,   In all His wondrous ways.
10131{_}863{_}_Matilda B. Edwards._   JACK FROST  The Frost looked forth one still, clear night, And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight; So, through the valley, and over the height,         In silence I'll take my way.
10131{_}864{_}I will not go on like that blustering train, The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain, That make such a bustle and noise in vain,         But I'll be as busy as they!"
10131{_}865{_}So he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest; He lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest With diamonds and pearls; and over the breast         Of the quivering lake he spread A coat of mail, that it need not fear The downward point of many a spear That he hung on its margin, far and near,         Where a rock could rear its head.
10131{_}866{_}He went to the windows of those who slept, And over each pane, like a fairy, crept; Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,         By the light of the morn were seen Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees; There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees; There were cities with temples and towers; and these         All pictured in silvery sheen!
10131{_}867{_}But he did one thing that was hardly fair-- He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there That all had forgotten for him to prepare--         "Now, just to set them a-thinking,  I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he, "This costly pitcher I'll burst in three; And the glass of water they've left for me         Shall 'tchick' to tell them I'm drinking!"

10131{_}888{_}_John Keats._   THE DOVE  I had a dove, and the sweet dove died; And I have thought it died of grieving: Oh, what could it grieve for?
10131{_}889{_}its feet were tied With a silken thread of my own hands' weaving.
10131{_}890{_}Sweet little red feet!
10131{_}891{_}Why should you die-- Why would you leave me, sweet bird!
10131{_}892{_}why?
10131{_}893{_}You lived alone in the forest tree; Why, pretty thing!
10131{_}894{_}would you not live with me?
10131{_}895{_}I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas; Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?
10131{_}896{_}_John Keats._   THE WIND IN A FROLIC  The wind one morning sprang up from sleep, Saying, "Now for a frolic!
10131{_}897{_}now for a leap!
10131{_}898{_}Now for a madcap, galloping chase!
10131{_}899{_}I'll make a commotion in every place!"
10131{_}900{_}So it swept with a bustle right through a great town, Creaking the signs, and scattering down The shutters, and whisking, with merciless squalls, Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.
10131{_}901{_}There never was heard a much lustier shout As the apples and oranges tumbled about; And urchins, that stand with their thievish eyes Forever on watch, ran off each with a prize.
10131{_}902{_}Then away to the fields it went blustering and humming, And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.
10131{_}903{_}It plucked by their tails the grave matronly cows, And tossed the colts' manes all about their brows, Till offended at such a familiar salute, They all turned their backs and stood silently mute.
10131{_}904{_}So on it went, capering and playing its pranks; Whistling with reeds on the broad river banks; Puffing the birds, as they sat on a spray, Or the travelers grave on the king's highway.
10131{_}905{_}It was not too nice to bustle the bags Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags.
10131{_}906{_}'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke With the doctor's wig, and the gentleman's cloak.
10131{_}907{_}Through the forest it roared, and cried gayly, "Now, You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"
10131{_}908{_}And it made them bow without more ado, Or it cracked their great branches through and through.
10131{_}909{_}Then it rushed like a monster o'er cottage and farm, Striking their inmates with sudden alarm; And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm.
10131{_}910{_}There were dames with kerchiefs tied over their caps, To see if their poultry were free from mishaps.
10131{_}911{_}The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud, And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd; There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on, Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.
10131{_}912{_}But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain, For it tossed him, and twirled him, then passed, and he stood With his hat in a pool and his shoe in the mud.
10131{_}913{_}_William Howitt._   A DAY  I'll tell you how the sun rose,--   A ribbon at a time.
10131{_}914{_}The steeples swam in amethyst,   The news like squirrels ran.
10131{_}915{_}The hills untied their bonnets,   The bobolinks begun.
10131{_}916{_}Then said I softly to myself,   "That must have been the sun!"
10131{_}917{_}But how he set I know not;   There seemed a purple stile Which little yellow boys and girls   Were climbing all the while.
10131{_}918{_}Till when they reached the other side,   A dominie in gray Put gently up the evening bars,   And led the flock away.
10131{_}919{_}_Emily Dickinson._   THE GRASS  The grass so little has to do,-- A sphere of simple green, With only butterflies to brood, And bees to entertain,  And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along, And hold the sunshine in its lap And bow to everything;  And thread the dews all night, like pearls, And make itself so fine,-- A duchess were too common For such a noticing.
10131{_}920{_}And even when it dies, to pass In odors so divine, As lowly spices gone to sleep, Or amulets of pine.
10131{_}921{_}And then to dwell in sovereign barns, And dream the days away,-- The grass so little has to do, I wish I were the hay.
10131{_}922{_}_Emily Dickinson._   WHITE SEAL  Oh!
10131{_}923{_}hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,   And black are the waters that sparkled so green.
10131{_}924{_}The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us   At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
10131{_}925{_}Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;   Ah, weary, wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!
10131{_}926{_}The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,   Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas.
10131{_}927{_}_Rudyard Kipling._   THE CAMEL'S HUMP  The Camel's hump is an ugly lump   Which well you may see at the Zoo; But uglier yet is the hump we get   From having too little to do.
10131{_}928{_}Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo, If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,   We get the hump--   Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue!
10131{_}929{_}We climb out of bed with a frouzly head   And a snarly-yarly voice.
10131{_}930{_}We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl   At our bath and our boots and our toys!
10131{_}931{_}And there ought to be a corner for me (And I know there is one for you)   When we get the hump--   Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue!
10131{_}932{_}The cure for this ill is not to sit still,   Or frowst with a book by the fire; But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,   And dig till you gently perspire.
10131{_}933{_}And then you will find that the sun and the wind And the Djinn of the Garden too,   Have lifted the hump--   The horrible hump-- The hump that is black and blue!
10131{_}934{_}I get it as well as you-oo-oo, If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo,   We all get hump--   Cameelious hump-- Kiddies and grown-ups too!
10131{_}935{_}_Rudyard Kipling._   THE TREE  The Tree's early leaf buds were bursting their brown; "Shall I take them away?"
10131{_}936{_}said the Frost, sweeping down.
10131{_}937{_}"No, leave them alone   Till the blossoms have grown," Prayed the Tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown.
10131{_}938{_}The Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung: "Shall I take them away?"
10131{_}939{_}said the Wind, as he swung.
10131{_}940{_}"No, leave them alone   Till the berries have grown," Said the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung.
10131{_}941{_}The Tree bore his fruit in the mid-summer glow: Said the girl, "May I gather thy berries now?"
10131{_}942{_}"Yes, all thou canst see:   Take them; all are for thee," Said the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low.

10131{_}959{_}Wrapped in your hood of green,   Violet, why Peep from your earth-door   So silent and shy?
10131{_}960{_}Trickle the little brooks   Close to your bed; Softest of fleecy clouds   Float overhead; "Ready and waiting!"
10131{_}961{_}The slender reeds sigh: "Ready and waiting!"
10131{_}962{_}We sing--May and I.
10131{_}963{_}Come, pretty Violet,   Winter's away: Come, for without you   May isn't May.

10131{_}965{_}Hear the rain whisper,   "Dear Violet, come!"
10131{_}966{_}How can you stay   In your underground home?

10131{_}973{_}"He's singing to me!

10131{_}975{_}And what does he say, little girl, little boy?
10131{_}976{_}"Oh, the world's running over with joy!
10131{_}977{_}Don't you hear?
10131{_}978{_}Don't you see?
10131{_}979{_}Hush!
10131{_}980{_}Look!
10131{_}981{_}In my tree, I'm as happy as happy can be!"
10131{_}982{_}And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see, And five eggs, hid by me in the juniper tree?
10131{_}983{_}Don't meddle!
10131{_}984{_}don't touch!

10131{_}994{_}You stare             In the air         Like a ghost in a chair, Always looking what I am about; I hate to be watched--I'll blow you out."
10131{_}995{_}The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.
10131{_}996{_}So deep,             On a heap         Of clouds, to sleep, Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon-- Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon."
10131{_}997{_}He turned in his bed; she was there again!
10131{_}998{_}On high             In the sky         With her one ghost eye, The Moon shone white and alive and plain.
10131{_}999{_}Said the Wind--"I will blow you out again."
10131{_}1000{_}The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim.
10131{_}1001{_}"With my sledge             And my wedge         I have knocked off her edge!
10131{_}1002{_}If only I blow right fierce and grim, The creature will soon be dimmer than dim."
10131{_}1003{_}He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.
10131{_}1004{_}"One puff             More's enough         To blow her to snuff!
10131{_}1005{_}One good puff more where the last was bred, And glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread!"
10131{_}1006{_}He blew a great blast, and the thread was gone;             In the air             Nowhere         Was a moonbeam bare; Far off and harmless the shy stars shone; Sure and certain the Moon was gone.
10131{_}1007{_}The Wind, he took to his revels once more;             On down             In town,         Like a merry-mad clown, He leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar, "What's that?"

10131{_}1009{_}He flew in a rage--he danced and blew;             But in vain             Was the pain         Of his bursting brain; For still the broader the Moon-scrap grew, The broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.
10131{_}1010{_}Slowly she grew--till she filled the night,             And shone             On her throne         In the sky alone, A matchless, wonderful, silvery light, Radiant and lovely, the Queen of the night.
10131{_}1011{_}Said the Wind--"What a marvel of power am I!
10131{_}1012{_}With my breath,             Good faith!
10131{_}1013{_}I blew her to death-- First blew her away right out of the sky-- Then blew her in; what strength have I!"
10131{_}1014{_}But the Moon, she knew nothing about the affair,           For high           In the sky,        With her one white eye, Motionless, miles above the air, She had never heard the great Wind blare.
10131{_}1015{_}_George Macdonald._   A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS  'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
10131{_}1016{_}The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,-- When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
10131{_}1017{_}Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash; The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below; When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
10131{_}1018{_}More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: "Now, Dasher!
10131{_}1019{_}now, Dancer!
10131{_}1020{_}now, Prancer and Vixen!
10131{_}1021{_}On, Comet!
10131{_}1022{_}on, Cupid!
10131{_}1023{_}on, Donder and Blitzen!-- To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall, Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"
10131{_}1024{_}As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So, up to the housetop the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys,--and St. Nicholas too.
10131{_}1025{_}And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
10131{_}1026{_}As I drew in my head and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound; He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
10131{_}1027{_}His eyes how they twinkled; his dimples how merry!
10131{_}1028{_}His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry; His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
10131{_}1029{_}The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.
10131{_}1030{_}He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.
10131{_}1031{_}He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf-- And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
10131{_}1032{_}A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
10131{_}1033{_}He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
10131{_}1034{_}He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
10131{_}1035{_}But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight, "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"

10131{_}1043{_}_Samuel T. Coleridge._   THE FIR-TREE  The winds have blown more bitter Each darkening day of fall; High over all the house-tops The stars are far and small I wonder, will my fir-tree Be green in spite of all?
10131{_}1044{_}O grief is colder--colder Than wind from any part; And tears of grief are bitter tears, And doubt's a sorer smart!
10131{_}1045{_}But I promised to my fir-tree To keep the fragrant heart.

10131{_}1047{_}It is quite time to go to bed."
10131{_}1048{_}"Ah!"
10131{_}1049{_}begged each silly, pouting leaf,   "Let us a little longer stay; Dear Father Tree, behold our grief;   Tis such a very pleasant day   We do not want to go away."
10131{_}1050{_}So, for just one more merry day   To the great tree the leaflets clung, Frolicked and danced, and had their way,   Upon the autumn breezes swung,   Whispering all their sports among,--  "Perhaps the great tree will forget,   And let us stay until the spring, If we all beg, and coax, and fret."
10131{_}1051{_}But the great tree did no such thing;   He smiled to hear their whispering.
10131{_}1052{_}"Come, children, all to bed," he cried;   And ere the leaves could urge their prayer, He shook his head, and far and wide,   Fluttering and rustling everywhere,   Down sped the leaflets through the air.
10131{_}1053{_}I saw them; on the ground they lay,   Golden and red, a huddled swarm, Waiting till one from far away,   White bedclothes heaped upon her arm,   Should come to wrap them safe and warm.
10131{_}1054{_}The great bare tree looked down and smiled,   "Good-night, dear little leaves," he said.
10131{_}1055{_}And from below each sleepy child   Replied, "Good-night," and murmured,   "It is so nice to go to bed!"

10131{_}1089{_}Did you steal a bit of the lake for your crest, And fasten blue violets into your vest?
10131{_}1090{_}Tell me, I pray you,--tell me true!
10131{_}1091{_}Did you dip your wings in azure dye, When April began to paint the sky, That was pale with the winter's stay?
10131{_}1092{_}Or were you hatched from a blue-bell bright, 'Neath the warm, gold breast of a sunbeam light, By the river one blue spring day?
10131{_}1093{_}O Blue Jay up in the maple tree, A-tossing your saucy head at me, With ne'er a word for my questioning, Pray, cease for a moment your "ting-a-link," And hear when I tell you what I think,-- You bonniest bit of spring.
10131{_}1094{_}I think when the fairies made the flowers, To grow in these mossy fields of ours, Periwinkles and violets rare, There was left of the spring's own color, blue, Plenty to fashion a flower whose hue Would be richer than all and as fair.
10131{_}1095{_}So, putting their wits together, they Made one great blossom so bright and gay, The lily beside it seemed blurred: And then they said, "We will toss it in air; So many blue blossoms grow everywhere, Let this pretty one be a bird."

10131{_}1098{_}It might have graced a rosy bower,   Instead of hiding there.

10131{_}1103{_}_John Bannister Tabb._   KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES _A Tale of the Talmud_  When Solomon was reigning in his glory,   Unto his throne the Queen of Sheba came, (So in the Talmud you may read the story)   Drawn by the magic of the monarch's fame, To see the splendors of his court, and bring Some fitting tribute to the mighty king.
10131{_}1104{_}Nor this alone; much had her Highness heard   What flowers of learning graced the royal speech; What gems of wisdom dropped with every word;   What wholesome lessons he was wont to teach In pleasing proverbs; and she wished, in sooth, To know if Rumor spoke the simple truth.
10131{_}1105{_}Besides, the queen had heard (which piqued her most)   How through the deepest riddles he could spy; How all the curious arts that women boast   Were quite transparent to his piercing eye; And so the queen had come--a royal guest-- To put the sage's cunning to the test.
10131{_}1106{_}And straight she held before the monarch's view,   In either hand, a radiant wreath of flowers; The one, bedecked with every charming hue,   Was newly culled from Nature's choicest bowers; The other, no less fair in every part, Was the rare product of divinest Art.
10131{_}1107{_}"Which is the true, and which the false?"
10131{_}1108{_}she said,   Great Solomon was silent.
10131{_}1109{_}All-amazed, Each wondering courtier shook his puzzled head,   While at the garlands long the monarch gazed, As one who sees a miracle, and fain, For very rapture, ne'er would speak again.
10131{_}1110{_}"Which is the true?"
10131{_}1111{_}once more the woman asked,   Pleased at the fond amazement of the king; "So wise a head should not be hardly tasked,   Most learned liege, with such a trivial thing!"
10131{_}1112{_}But still the sage was silent; it was plain A deepening doubt perplexed the royal brain.
10131{_}1113{_}While thus he pondered, presently he sees,   Hard by the casement,--so the story goes,-- A little band of busy, bustling bees,   Hunting for honey in a withered rose.
10131{_}1114{_}The monarch smiled, and raised his royal head; "Open the window!"
10131{_}1115{_}--that was all he said.
10131{_}1116{_}The window opened at the king's command;   Within the room the eager insects flew, And sought the flowers in Sheba's dexter hand!
10131{_}1117{_}And so the king and all the courtiers knew That wreath was Nature's; and the baffled queen Returned to tell the wonders she had seen.
10131{_}1118{_}My story teaches (every tale should bear   A fitting moral) that the wise may find In trifles light as atoms in the air,   Some useful lesson to enrich the mind, Some truth designed to profit or to please,-- As Israel's king learned wisdom from the bees!

10131{_}1120{_}O fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows, It calls but the warders that guard thy repose; Their bows would be bended, their blades would be red, Ere the step of a foeman drew near to thy bed.
10131{_}1121{_}O hush thee, my baby, the time soon will come, When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum; Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may, For strife comes with manhood, and waking with day.

10131{_}1136{_}Behold the chief who now commands, Once more to serve his country, stands--   The rock on which the storm will beat,   The rock on which the storm will beat; But, armed in virtue firm and true, His hopes are fixed on Heaven and you;   When hope was sinking in dismay,   And glooms obscured Columbia's day,   His steady mind, from changes free,   Resolved on death or liberty.

10131{_}1143{_}Said he, "The mystery I've found,-- I'll turn me round."
10131{_}1144{_}-- He turned him round;   But still it hung behind him.

10131{_}1146{_}And right, and left, and round about, And up, and down, and in, and out He turned; but still the pigtail stout   Hung steadily behind him.
10131{_}1147{_}And though his efforts never slack, And though he twist, and twirl, and tack, Alas!
10131{_}1148{_}still faithful to his back   The pigtail hangs behind him.

10131{_}1185{_}"To you, in David's town, this day   Is born, of David's line, The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;   And this shall be the sign:  "The heavenly babe you there shall find   To human view displayed, All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,   And in a manger laid."
10131{_}1186{_}Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith   Appeared a shining throng Of angels, praising God, and thus   Addressed their joyful song:  "All glory be to God on high,   And to the earth be peace: Good-will henceforth from heaven to men   Begin and never cease!"
10131{_}1187{_}_Nahum Tate._   THE SNOW-BIRD'S SONG  The ground was all covered with snow one day, And two little sisters were busy at play, When a snow-bird was sitting close by on a tree, And merrily singing his chick-a-dee-dee,        Chick-a-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee, And merrily singing his chick-a-dee-dee.
10131{_}1188{_}He had not been singing that tune very long, Ere Emily heard him, so loud was his song; "Oh, sister, look out of the window," said she, "Here's a dear little bird singing chick-a-dee-dee.
10131{_}1189{_}Chick-a-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee, Here's a dear little bird singing chick-a-dee-dee.
10131{_}1190{_}"Oh, mother, do get him some stockings and shoes, And a nice little frock, and a hat if you choose; I wish he'd come into the parlor, and see How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-dee-dee!
10131{_}1191{_}Chick-a-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee, How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-dee-dee!"
10131{_}1192{_}"There is One, my dear child, though I cannot tell who, Has clothed me already, and warm enough too.
10131{_}1193{_}Good morning!
10131{_}1194{_}Oh, who are so happy as we?"
10131{_}1195{_}And away he went singing his chick-a-dee-dee.
10131{_}1196{_}Chick-a-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee, And away he went singing his chick-a-dee-dee.

10131{_}1198{_}Woodworth._   SPRING  The alder by the river   Shakes out her powdery curls; The willow buds in silver   For little boys and girls.
10131{_}1199{_}The little birds fly over   And oh, how sweet they sing!
10131{_}1200{_}To tell the happy children   That once again 'tis spring.
10131{_}1201{_}The gay green grass comes creeping   So soft beneath their feet; The frogs begin to ripple   A music clear and sweet.
10131{_}1202{_}And buttercups are coming,   And scarlet columbine, And in the sunny meadows   The dandelions shine.
10131{_}1203{_}And just as many daisies   As their soft hands can hold The little ones may gather,   All fair in white and gold.
10131{_}1204{_}Here blows the warm red clover,   There peeps the violet blue; O happy little children!
10131{_}1205{_}God made them all for you.
10131{_}1206{_}_Celia Thaxter._   THE SANDPIPER  Across the narrow beach we flit,   One little sandpiper and I; And fast I gather, bit by bit,   The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.
10131{_}1207{_}The wild waves reach their hands for it,   The wild wind raves, the tide runs high, As up and down the beach we flit,   One little sandpiper and I.
10131{_}1208{_}Above our heads the sullen clouds   Scud black and swift across the sky; Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds   Stand out the white lighthouses high.
10131{_}1209{_}Almost as far as eye can reach   I see the close-reefed vessels fly, As fast we flit along the beach,--   One little sandpiper and I.  I watch him as he skims along,   Uttering his sweet and mournful cry; He starts not at my fitful song,   Or flash of fluttering drapery.
10131{_}1210{_}He has no thought of any wrong;   He scans me with a fearless eye.
10131{_}1211{_}Staunch friends are we, well tried and strong,   The little sandpiper and I.  Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night   When the loosed storm breaks furiously?
10131{_}1212{_}My driftwood fire will burn so bright!
10131{_}1213{_}To what warm shelter canst thou fly?
10131{_}1214{_}I do not fear for thee, though wroth The tempest rushes through the sky:   For are we not God's children both, Thou, little sandpiper, and I?
10131{_}1215{_}_Celia Thaxter._   O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM  O little town of Bethlehem,   How still we see thee lie!
10131{_}1216{_}Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth   The everlasting Light; The hopes and fears of all the years   Are met in thee to-night.
10131{_}1217{_}For Christ is born of Mary,   And, gathered all above, While mortals sleep, the angels keep   Their watch of wondering love.
10131{_}1218{_}O morning stars, together   Proclaim the holy birth!
10131{_}1219{_}And praises sing to God the King,   And peace to men on earth.
10131{_}1220{_}How silently, how silently,   The wondrous gift is given!
10131{_}1221{_}So God imparts to human hearts   The blessings of His heaven.
10131{_}1222{_}No ear may hear His coming,   But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him still,   The dear Christ enters in.
10131{_}1223{_}O holy Child of Bethlehem!
10131{_}1224{_}Descend to us, we pray; Cast out our sin, and enter in,   Be born in us to-day.
10131{_}1225{_}We hear the Christmas angels   The great glad tidings tell; Oh, come to us, abide with us,   Our Lord Emmanuel!
10131{_}1226{_}_Phillips Brooks._   THE SANDMAN  The rosy clouds float overhead,   The sun is going down, And now the sandman's gentle tread   Comes stealing through the town.
10131{_}1227{_}"White sand, white sand," he softly cries,       And, as he shakes his hand,     Straightway there lies on babies' eyes       His gift of shining sand.
10131{_}1228{_}Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown, As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he      goes through the town.
10131{_}1229{_}From sunny beaches far away,       Yes, in another land,     He gathers up at break of day       His store of shining sand.
10131{_}1230{_}No tempests beat that shore remote,       No ships may sail that way;     His little boat alone may float       Within that lovely bay.
10131{_}1231{_}Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown, As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he      goes through the town.
10131{_}1232{_}He smiles to see the eyelids close       Above the happy eyes!
10131{_}1233{_}And every child right well he knows--       Oh, he is very wise!
10131{_}1234{_}But if, as he goes through the land,       A naughty baby cries,     His other hand takes dull gray sand       To close the wakeful eyes.
10131{_}1235{_}Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown, As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he      goes through the town.
10131{_}1236{_}So when you hear the sandman's song     Sound through the twilight sweet,   Be sure you do not keep him long     A-waiting on the street.
10131{_}1237{_}Lie softly down, dear little head,     Rest quiet, busy hands,   Till, by your bed his good-night said,     He strews the shining sands.
10131{_}1238{_}Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown, As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he      goes through the town.
10131{_}1239{_}_Margaret Vandegrift._   RED RIDING-HOOD  On the wide lawn the snow lay deep, Ridged o'er with many a drifted heap; The wind that through the pine-trees sung The naked elm-boughs tossed and swung; While, through the window, frosty-starred, Against the sunset purple barred, We saw the sombre crow flap by, The hawk's gray fleck along the sky,  The crested blue-jay flitting swift, The squirrel poising on the drift, Erect, alert, his broad gray tail Set to the north wind like a sail.
10131{_}1240{_}It came to pass, our little lass, With flattened face against the glass, And eyes in which the tender dew Of pity shone, stood gazing through The narrow space her rosy lips Had melted from the frost's eclipse: "Oh, see," she cried, "the poor blue-jays!
10131{_}1241{_}What is it that the black crow says?
10131{_}1242{_}The squirrel lifts his little legs Because he has no hands, and begs; He's asking for my nuts, I know; May I not feed them on the snow?"
10131{_}1243{_}Half lost within her boots, her head Warm-sheltered in her hood of red, Her plaid skirt close about her drawn, She floundered down the wintry lawn; Now struggling through the misty veil Blown round her by the shrieking gale; Now sinking in a drift so low Her scarlet hood could scarcely show Its dash of color on the snow.
10131{_}1244{_}She dropped for bird and beast forlorn Her little store of nuts and corn, And thus her timid guests bespoke: "Come, squirrel, from your hollow oak,-- Come, black old crow,--come, poor blue-jay, Before your supper's blown away!
10131{_}1245{_}Don't be afraid, we all are good; And I'm mamma's Red Riding-Hood!"
10131{_}1246{_}O Thou whose care is over all, Who heedest even the sparrow's fall, Keep in the little maiden's breast The pity which is now its guest!
10131{_}1247{_}Let not her cultured years make less The childhood charm of tenderness, But let her feel as well as know, Nor harder with her polish grow!
10131{_}1248{_}Unmoved by sentimental grief That wails along some printed leaf, But prompt with kindly word and deed To own the claims of all who need, Let the grown woman's self make good The promise of Red Riding-Hood!
10131{_}1249{_}_John G. Whittier._   THE SONG SPARROW  There is a bird I know so well,   It seems as if he must have sung   Beside my crib when I was young; Before I knew the way to spell   The name of even the smallest bird,   His gentle, joyful song I heard.
10131{_}1250{_}Now see if you can tell, my dear, What bird it is, that every year, Sings "Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer."
10131{_}1251{_}He comes in March, when winds are strong,   And snow returns to hide the earth;   But still he warms his head with mirth, And waits for May.
10131{_}1252{_}He lingers long   While flowers fade, and every day   Repeats his sweet, contented lay; As if to say we need not fear The season's change, if love is here, With "Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer."
10131{_}1253{_}He does not wear a Joseph's coat   Of many colors, smart and gay;   His suit is Quaker brown and gray, With darker patches at his throat.
10131{_}1254{_}And yet of all the well-dressed throng,   Not one can sing so brave a song.
10131{_}1255{_}It makes the pride of looks appear A vain and foolish thing to hear His "Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer."
10131{_}1256{_}_Henry van Dyke._   I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER  I remember, I remember,   The house where I was born, The little window where the sun   Came peeping in at morn; He never came a wink too soon,   Nor brought too long a day; But now, I often wish the night   Had borne my breath away.
10131{_}1257{_}I remember, I remember,   The roses, red and white; The violets and the lily-cups,   Those flowers made of light!
10131{_}1258{_}The lilacs where the robin built,   And where my brother set The laburnum on his birthday,--   The tree is living yet!
10131{_}1259{_}I remember, I remember,   Where I was used to swing; And thought the air must rush as fresh   To swallows on the wing; My spirit flew in feathers then,   That is so heavy now, And summer pools could hardly cool   The fever on my brow!
10131{_}1260{_}I remember, I remember,   The fir trees dark and high; I used to think their slender tops   Were close against the sky; It was a childish ignorance,   But now 'tis little joy To know I'm farther off from Heaven   Than when I was a boy.
10131{_}1261{_}_Thomas Hood._   TALKING IN THEIR SLEEP      "You think I am dead,"     The apple tree said, "Because I have never a leaf to show--     Because I stoop,     And my branches droop, And the dull gray mosses over me grow!
10131{_}1262{_}But I'm still alive in trunk and shoot;     The buds of next May     I fold away-- But I pity the withered grass at my root."
10131{_}1263{_}"You think I am dead,"     The quick grass said, "Because I have parted with stem and blade!
10131{_}1264{_}But under the ground     I am safe and sound With the snow's thick blanket over me laid.
10131{_}1265{_}I'm all alive, and ready to shoot,     Should the spring of the year     Come dancing here-- But I pity the flower without branch or root."
10131{_}1266{_}"You think I am dead,"     A soft voice said, "Because not a branch or root I own.
10131{_}1267{_}I never have died,     But close I hide In a plumy seed that the wind has sown.
10131{_}1268{_}Patient I wait through the long winter hours;     You will see me again--     I shall laugh at you then, Out of the eyes of a hundred flowers."
10131{_}1269{_}_Edith M. Thomas._   LITTLE DANDELION  Little bud Dandelion   Hears from her nest, "Merry heart, starry eye,   Wake from your rest!"
10131{_}1270{_}Wide ope the emerald lids;   Robin's above; Wise little Dandelion   Smiles at his love.
10131{_}1271{_}Cold lie the daisy-banks,   Clad but in green, Where in the Mays agone   Bright hues were seen.
10131{_}1272{_}Wild pinks are slumbering,   Violets delay-- True little Dandelion   Greeteth the May.
10131{_}1273{_}Meek little Dandelion   Groweth more fair, Till dries the amber dew   Out from her hair.
10131{_}1274{_}High rides the thirsty sun,   Fiercely and high,-- Faint little Dandelion   Closeth her eye.
10131{_}1275{_}Dead little Dandelion,   In her white shroud, Heareth the angel-breeze   Call from the cloud.
10131{_}1276{_}Tiny plumes fluttering   Make no delay, Little winged Dandelion   Soareth away.

10131{_}1392{_}Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
10131{_}1393{_}It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
10131{_}1394{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10131{_}1395{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
10131{_}1396{_}To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

10131{_}1405{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10131{_}1406{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10131{_}1407{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.

10131{_}1416{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10131{_}1417{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10131{_}1418{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10131{_}1419{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10131{_}1420{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10131{_}1421{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10131{_}1422{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10131{_}1423{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10131{_}1424{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10131{_}1425{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10131{_}1426{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10131{_}1427{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10131{_}1428{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10131{_}1429{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10131{_}1430{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10131{_}1431{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10131{_}1432{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
