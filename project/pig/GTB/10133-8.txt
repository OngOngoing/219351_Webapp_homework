10133-8{_}6{_}Of these two MSS.
10133-8{_}7{_}the better written may be assigned (at earliest) to the close of the seventh century; the other (again at earliest) to the close of the ninth.
10133-8{_}8{_}Both are corrupt; the work of two illiterate copyists who--strange to say--were both smatterers enough to betray their little knowledge by converting _Pervigilium_ into _Per Virgilium_ (_scilicet_, "by Virgil"): thus helping us to follow the process of thought by which the Middle Ages turned Virgil into a wizard.
10133-8{_}9{_}Here and there the texts become quite silly, separately or in consent; and just where they agree in the most surprising way--_i.e._ in the arrangement of the lines--the conjectural emendator is invited to do his worst by a note at the head of the older Codex, "Sunt vero versus xxii"--"There are rightly twenty-two lines."
10133-8{_}10{_}This has started much ingenious guess-work.
10133-8{_}11{_}But no really convincing rearrangement has been achieved as yet; and I have been content to take the text pretty well as it stands, with a few corrections upon which most scholars agree.
10133-8{_}12{_}With a poem of "paratactic structure" the best of us may easily go astray by transposing lines, or blocks of lines, to correspond with _our_ sequence of thought; and I shall be content if, following the only texts to which appeal can be made,[1] my translation be generally intelligible.
10133-8{_}13{_}It runs pretty closely, line for line, with the original; because one may love and emulate classical terseness even while despairing to rival it.
10133-8{_}14{_}But it does not attempt to be literal; for even were it worth doing, I doubt if it be possible for anyone in our day to hit precisely the note intended by an author or heard by a reader in the eighth century.
10133-8{_}15{_}Men change subtly as nations succeed to nations, religions to religions, philosophies to philosophies; and it is a property of immortal poetry to shift its appeal.
10133-8{_}16{_}It does not live by continuing to mean the some thing.
10133-8{_}17{_}It grows as we grow.
10133-8{_}18{_}We smile, for instance, when some interlocutor in a dialogue of Plato takes a line from the _Iliad_ and applies it seriously _au pied de la lettre_.
10133-8{_}19{_}We can hardly conceive what the great line conveyed to him; but it may mean something equally serious to us, though in a different way.
10133-8{_}20{_}[1] Facsimiles of the two Codices can be studied in a careful edition of the _Pervigilum_ by Mr Cecil Clementi, published by Mr B.H.

10133-8{_}22{_}PERVIGILIUM VENERIS  _Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet_.
10133-8{_}23{_}Ver novum, ver jam canorurn, vere natus orbis est; Vere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites, Et nemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus.
10133-8{_}24{_}Cras amorum copulatrix inter umbras arborum     5 Inplicat casas virentes de flagello myrteo: Cras Dione jura dicit fulta sublimi throno.

10133-8{_}26{_}_To-morrow--What news of to-morrow?
10133-8{_}27{_}Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!
10133-8{_}28{_}It is Spring, it is chorussing Spring; 'tis the birthday of Earth, and     for you!
10133-8{_}29{_}It is Spring; and the Loves and the birds wing together and woo to accord Where the bough to the rain has unbraided her locks as a bride to     her lord.
10133-8{_}30{_}For she walks--she our Lady, our Mistress of Wedlock--the woodlands     atween,     5 And the bride-bed she weaves them, with myrtle enlacing, with curtains     of green.
10133-8{_}31{_}Look aloft!
10133-8{_}32{_}list the law of Dione, sublime and enthroned in the blue: _Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!
10133-8{_}33{_}Tunc liquore de superno spumeo et ponti globo, Cærulas inter catervas, inter et bipedes equos,     10 Fecit undantem Dionen de maritis imbribus.
10133-8{_}34{_}_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quiqiie amavit cras amet_.
10133-8{_}35{_}Ipsa gemmis purpurantem pingit annum floribus, Ipsa surgentes papillas de Favoni spiritu Urget in toros tepentes; ipsa roris lucidi     15 Noctis aura quem relinquit, spargit umentes aquas.
10133-8{_}36{_}Et micant lacrimæ trementes de caduco pondere:  Time was that a rain-cloud begat her, impregning the heave of the deep, 'Twixt hooves of sea-horses a-scatter, stampeding the dolphins as     sheep.
10133-8{_}37{_}10 Lo!
10133-8{_}38{_}arose of that bridal Dione, rainbow'd and besprent of its dew!
10133-8{_}39{_}_Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!
10133-8{_}40{_}She, she, with her gem-dripping finger enamels the wreath of the year; She, she, when the maid-bud is nubile and swelling winds--whispers anear, Disguising her voice in the Zephyr's--"So secret the bed!
10133-8{_}41{_}And thou     shy?"
10133-8{_}42{_}15 She, she, thro' the hush'd humid Midsummer night draws the dew from on     high; Dew bright with the tears of its origin, dew with its weight on the bough,  Gutta præceps orbe parvo sustinet casus suos.
10133-8{_}43{_}En, pudorem florulentæ prodiderunt purpuræ: Umor ille quern serenis astra rorant noctibus     20 Mane virgineas papillas solvit umenti peplo.
10133-8{_}44{_}Ipsa jussit mane ut udas virgines nubant rosæ; Fusa Paphies de cruore deque Amoris osculis Deque gemmis deque flammis deque solis purpuris, Cras ruborem qui latebat veste tectus ignea     25 Unico marita nodo non pudebit solvere.
10133-8{_}45{_}_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet_.
10133-8{_}46{_}Misdoubting and clinging and trembling--"Now, now must I fall?
10133-8{_}47{_}Is it now?"
10133-8{_}48{_}Star-fleck'd on the stem of the brier as it gathers and falters and flows, Lo!
10133-8{_}49{_}its trail runs a ripple of fire on the nipple it bids be a     rose,     20 Yet englobes it diaphanous, veil upon veil in a tiffany drawn To bedrape the small virginal breasts yet unripe for the spousal of dawn; Till the vein'd very vermeil of Venus, till Cupid's incarnadine kiss, Till the ray of the ruby, the sunrise, ensanguine the bath of her bliss; Till the wimple her bosom uncover, a tissue of fire to the view,     25 And the zone o'er the wrists of the lover slip down as they reach to undo.
10133-8{_}50{_}_Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew_!
10133-8{_}51{_}Ipsa nymphas diva luco jussit ire myrteo: It puer comes puellis.
10133-8{_}52{_}Nee tamen credi potest Esse Amorem feriatum, si sagittas vexerit.
10133-8{_}53{_}30 Ite, nymphæ, posuit arma, feriatus est Amor; Jussus est inermis ire, nudus ire jussus est, Neu quid arcu, neu sagitta, neu quid igne Iæderet; Sed tamen nymphse cavete, quod Cupido pulcher est; Est in armis totus idem quando nudus est Amor!
10133-8{_}54{_}35  _Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit eras amet_.
10133-8{_}55{_}Conpari Venus pudore mittit ad te virgines:  "Go, maidens," Our Lady commands, "while the myrtle is green in the     groves, Take the Boy to your escort."
10133-8{_}56{_}"But ah!"
10133-8{_}57{_}cry the maidens, "what trust     is in Love's Keeping holiday too, while he weareth his archery, tools of his     trade?"
10133-8{_}58{_}30 "Go!
10133-8{_}59{_}he lays them aside, an apprentice released; ye may wend unafraid.
10133-8{_}60{_}See, I bid him disarm, he disarms; mother-naked I bid him to go, And he goes mother-naked.
10133-8{_}61{_}What flame can he shoot without arrow or bow?"
10133-8{_}62{_}Yet beware ye of Cupid, ye maidens!
10133-8{_}63{_}Beware most of all when he charms As a child: for the more he runs naked, the more he's a strong     man-at-arms.

10133-8{_}84{_}Ipsa venas atque mentem permeanti spiritu Intus occultis gubernat procreatrix viribus, Perque coelum, perque terras, perque pontum     subditum Pervium sui tenorem seminali tramite     65  She has coax'd her the shade of the hazel to cover     the wind-flower's birth.
10133-8{_}85{_}Since the day the Great Father begat it, descending     in streams upon Earth; When the Seasons were hid in his loins, and the     Earth lay recumbent, a wife, To receive in the searching and genital shower the     60     soft secret of life.
10133-8{_}86{_}As the terrible thighs drew it down, and conceived,     as the embryo ran Thoro' blood, thoro' brain, and the Mother gave all     to the making of man, She, she, our Dione, directed the seminal current to     creep, Penetrating, possessing, by devious paths all the     height, all the deep.
10133-8{_}87{_}She, of all procreation procuress, the share to the     65     furrow laid true;  Inbuit, jussitque mundum nosse nascendi vias.

10133-8{_}89{_}_Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras     amet._  She, she, to the womb drave the knowledge, and open'd the ecstasy through.

10133-8{_}91{_}_Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have loved, love anew!_  Rura fecundat voluptas: rura Venerem sentiunt:     75 Ipse Amor puer Dionse rure natus dicitur.

10133-8{_}96{_}In a field was Dione in labour delivered of Cupid the      Boy; And the field in its fostering lap from her travail      received him: he drew Mother's milk from the delicate kisses of flowers;      and he prosper'd and grew-- _Now learn ye to love who loved never--now ye who have      loved, love anew!_  Lo!

10133-8{_}157{_}_One of the Crowd_.
10133-8{_}158{_}But through the town below a horseman spurs-- I think, Count Lucio!
10133-8{_}159{_}Yes--Count Lucio!
10133-8{_}160{_}He nears, draws rein, dismounts!
10133-8{_}161{_}_Cesario_.
10133-8{_}162{_}Sure, he brings news.
10133-8{_}163{_}_Gamba_.
10133-8{_}164{_}I think he brings word the Duke is sick; his loyal folk have drunk so much of his health.
10133-8{_}165{_}[_A murmur has been growing in the town below.
10133-8{_}166{_}It breaks into cheers as Count Lucio comes springing up to the terrace._  _Enter Lucio._   _Lucio._ News!
10133-8{_}167{_}Where's the Regent?
10133-8{_}168{_}Eh?
10133-8{_}169{_}is Mass not said?
10133-8{_}170{_}Cesario, news!
10133-8{_}171{_}I rode across the dunes; A pilot--Nestore--you know the man-- Came panting.
10133-8{_}172{_}Sixteen sail beyond the point!
10133-8{_}173{_}That's not a galley lost!
10133-8{_}174{_}_Crowd._            Long live the Duke!
10133-8{_}175{_}_Lucio._ Hark to the tocsin!
10133-8{_}176{_}I have carried fire-- Wildfire!
10133-8{_}177{_}Why, where's my sister?
10133-8{_}178{_}I've a mind--   [_He strides towards the door of the Chapel; but pauses at the sound of chanting within, and comes back to Cesario._   Man, are you mute?
10133-8{_}179{_}I say the town's aflame Below!
10133-8{_}180{_}But here, up here, you stand and stare Like prisoners loosed to daylight.
10133-8{_}181{_}Rub your eyes, Believe!
10133-8{_}182{_}_Cesario (musing)._ It has been long.
10133-8{_}183{_}_Lucio._                            As tapestry Pricked out by women's needles; point-device As saints in fitted haloes.
10133-8{_}184{_}Yet they stab, Those needles.
10133-8{_}185{_}Oh, the devil take their tongues!
10133-8{_}186{_}_Cesario._ Why, what's the matter?
10133-8{_}187{_}_Lucio._ P'st!
10133-8{_}188{_}another lie Against the Countess Fulvia; and the train Laid to my sister's ear.
10133-8{_}189{_}Cesario, My sister is a saint--and yet she married: Therefore should understand ... Would saints, like cobblers, Stick but to business in this naughty world!
10133-8{_}190{_}Ah, well!
10133-8{_}191{_}the Duke comes home.
10133-8{_}192{_}_Cesario._ And what of that?
10133-8{_}193{_}_Lucio._ Release!
10133-8{_}194{_}_Cesario._ Release?
10133-8{_}195{_}_Lucio (mocking a chant within the Chapel)._ From priests and petticoats Deliver us, Good Lord!
10133-8{_}196{_}_Gamba (strikes a chord on viol).
10133-8{_}197{_}AMEN!_  _Cesario._ Count Lucio, These seven years agone, when the Duke sailed, You were a child--a pretty, forward boy; And I a young lieutenant of the Guard, Burning to serve abroad.
10133-8{_}198{_}But that day, rather, I clenched my nails over an inward wound: For that a something manlier than my years-- Look, bearing, what-not--by the Duke not miss'd, Condemned me to promotion: I must bide At home, command the Guard!
10133-8{_}199{_}'Tis an old hurt, But scalded on my memory.... Well, they sailed!
10133-8{_}200{_}And from the terrace here, sick with self-pity, Wrapped in my wrong, forgetful of devoir, I watch'd them through a mist--turned with a sob-- Uptore my rooted sight--                          There, there she stood; Her hand press'd to her girdle, where the babe Stirred in her body while she gazed--she gazed-- But slowly back controlled her eyes, met mine; So--with how wan, how small, how brave a smile!-- Reached me her hands to kiss ...                                 O royal hands!
10133-8{_}201{_}What burdens since they have borne let Adria tell.
10133-8{_}202{_}But hear me swear by them, Count Lucio-- Who slights our Regent throws his glove to me.
10133-8{_}203{_}_Lucio._ Why, soothly, she's my sister!
10133-8{_}204{_}_Cesario._ 'But the court Is dull?
10133-8{_}205{_}No masques, few banquetings--and prayers Be long, and youth for pastime leaps the gate?'
10133-8{_}206{_}Yet if the money husbanded on feasts Have fed our soldiery against the Turk, Year after year, and still the State not starved; Was't not well done?
10133-8{_}207{_}And if, responsible To God, and lonely, she has leaned on God Too heavily for our patience, was't not wise?-- And well, though weary?
10133-8{_}208{_}_Lucio._ I tell you, she's my sister!
10133-8{_}209{_}_Cesario._ Well, an you will, bridle on that.
10133-8{_}210{_}Lord Lucio, You named the Countess Fulvia.
10133-8{_}211{_}To my sorrow, Two hours ago I called on her and laid her Under arrest.
10133-8{_}212{_}_Lucio._ The devil!
10133-8{_}213{_}For what?
10133-8{_}214{_}_Cesario._ For that A lady, whose lord keeps summer in the hills To nurse a gouty foot, should penalize His dutiful return by shutting doors And hanging out a ladder made of rope, Or prove its safety by rehearsing it Upon a heavier man.
10133-8{_}215{_}_Lucio._ I'll go to her.
10133-8{_}216{_}Oh, this is infamous!
10133-8{_}217{_}_Cesario._ Nay, be advised: No hardship irks the lady, save to sit At home and feed her sparrows; nor no worse Annoy than from her balcony to spy (Should the eye rove) a Switzer of the Guard At post between her raspberry-canes, to watch And fright the thrushes from forbidden fruit.
10133-8{_}218{_}_Lucio._ Infamous!
10133-8{_}219{_}infamous!
10133-8{_}220{_}_Cesario._ Enough, my lord: The Regent!
10133-8{_}221{_}[_Doors of the Chapel open.
10133-8{_}222{_}The organ sounds, with voices of choir chanting the recessional.
10133-8{_}223{_}The Court enters from Mass, attending the Regent Ottilia and her son Tonino.
10133-8{_}224{_}She wears a crown and heavy dalmatic.
10133-8{_}225{_}Her brother Lucio, controlling himself with an effort, kisses her hand and conducts her to the marble bench, which serves for her Chair of State.
10133-8{_}226{_}She bows, receiving the homage of the crowd; but, after seating herself, appears for a few moments unconscious of her surroundings.
10133-8{_}227{_}Then, as her rosary slips from her fingers and falls heavily at her feet, she speaks._  _Regent._ So slips the chain linking this world with Heaven, And drops me back to earth: so slips the chain That hangs my spirit to the Redeemer's cross Above pollution in the pure swept air Whereunder frets this hive: so slips the chain-- _(She starts up)_--God!
10133-8{_}228{_}the dear sound!
10133-8{_}229{_}Was that his anchor dropped?
10133-8{_}230{_}Speak to the watchman, one!
10133-8{_}231{_}Call to the watch!
10133-8{_}232{_}What news?
10133-8{_}233{_}_Cesario._ Aloft!
10133-8{_}234{_}What news?

10133-8{_}236{_}_Regent._ Ah, pardon, sirs!
10133-8{_}237{_}My ears are strung to-day, And play false airs invented by the wind.
10133-8{_}238{_}Methought a hawse-pipe rattled ...  _Gamba (chants to his viol).
10133-8{_}239{_}Shepherds, see-- Lo!
10133-8{_}240{_}What a mariner love hath made me!_  _Regent._ What chants the Fool?
10133-8{_}241{_}_Gamba._ Madonna, 'tis a trifle Made by a silly poet on wives that stand All night at windows listening the surf-- _Now he comes!

10133-8{_}248{_}Sixteen sail, And nearing fast!
10133-8{_}249{_}_Regent._ Praise God!
10133-8{_}250{_}dear Lucio!
10133-8{_}251{_}[_She has seated herself again.

10133-8{_}254{_}That's like you.
10133-8{_}255{_}But for yourself the hour, too, holds release.

10133-8{_}257{_}_Regent._          You will forgive?
10133-8{_}258{_}I have great need To be forgiven: sadly I have been slack In guardianship, and by so much betrayed My promise to our mother's passing soul.
10133-8{_}259{_}Myself in cares immersed, I left the child Among his toys--and turn to find him man-- But yet so much a boy that boyhood can _(Wistfully)_ Laugh in his honest eyes?
10133-8{_}260{_}Forgive me, Lucio!
10133-8{_}261{_}Tell me, whate'er have slackened, there has slipped No knot of love.
10133-8{_}262{_}To-morrow we'll make sport, Be playmates and invent new games, and old-- Wreath flowers for crowns--   [_He drags his hand away.

10133-8{_}265{_}First, a scoundrel here in irons For having struck the Guard.

10133-8{_}271{_}Do you confess the assault?
10133-8{_}272{_}_Prisoner._ I do.
10133-8{_}273{_}_Regent._ Upon a promise we dismiss you.
10133-8{_}274{_}Your tavern, as it comes into our mind, Is the 'Three Cups.'
10133-8{_}275{_}So many, and no more, You'll drink to-day--have we your word?
10133-8{_}276{_}Three cups, And each a _Viva_ for the Duke's return.

10133-8{_}291{_}_Regent._ Ay--ay, the cow is sick, I think; and mind me, being country-bred, Of a cure for such: which is, to buy a comb And comb the sufferer's tail at feeding-time.
10133-8{_}292{_}If Zia Agnese do but this, she'll counter The Evil Eye, and maybe with her own Detect who thieves her Serafina's hay.

10133-8{_}680{_}POEMS     EXMOOR VERSES  I. VASHTI'S SONG   Over the rim of the Moor,   And under the starry sky, Two men came to my door   And rested them thereby.
10133-8{_}681{_}Beneath the bough and the star,   In a whispering foreign tongue, They talked of a land afar   And the merry days so young!
10133-8{_}682{_}Beneath the dawn and the bough   I heard them arise and go: And my heart it is aching now   For the more it will never know.
10133-8{_}683{_}Why did they two depart   Before I could understand?
10133-8{_}684{_}Where lies that land, O my heart?
10133-8{_}685{_}--O my heart, where lies that land?
10133-8{_}686{_}II.
10133-8{_}687{_}SATURN   From my farm, from hèr farm   Furtively we came.
10133-8{_}688{_}In either home a hearth was warm:   We nursed a hungrier flame.
10133-8{_}689{_}Our feet were foul with mire,   Our faces blind with mist; But all the night was naked fire   About us where we kiss'd.
10133-8{_}690{_}To her farm, to my farm,   Loathing we returned; Pale beneath a gallow's arm   The planet Saturn burned.
10133-8{_}691{_}III.
10133-8{_}692{_}DERELICTION   O'er the tears that we shed, dear   The bitter vines twist, And the hawk and the red deer   They keep where we kiss'd: All broken lies the shieling   That sheltered from rain, With a star to pierce the ceiling,   And the dawn an empty pane.
10133-8{_}693{_}Thro' the mist, up the moorway,   Fade hunters and pack; From the ridge to thy doorway   Happy voices float back ... O, between the threads o' mist, love,   Reach your hands from the house.
10133-8{_}694{_}Only mind that we kiss'd, love,   And forget the broken vows!
10133-8{_}695{_}TWO FOLK SONGS  I.
10133-8{_}696{_}THE SOLDIER  (_Roumanian_)   _When winter trees bestrew the path,   Still to the twig a leaf or twain Will cling and weep, not Winter's wrath,   But that foreknown forlorner pain--   To fall when green leaves come again._  I watch'd him sleep by the furrow--   The first that fell in the fight.
10133-8{_}697{_}His grave they would dig to-morrow:   The battle called them to-night.
10133-8{_}698{_}They bore him aside to the trees, there,   By his undigg'd grave content To lie on his back at ease there,   And hark how the battle went.
10133-8{_}699{_}The battle went by the village,   And back through the night were borne Far cries of murder and pillage,   With smoke from the standing corn.
10133-8{_}700{_}But when they came on the morrow,   They talk'd not over their task, As he listen'd there by the furrow;   For the dead mouth could not ask--  _How went the battle, my brothers?_   But that he will never know: For his mouth the red earth smothers   As they shoulder their spades and go.
10133-8{_}701{_}Yet he cannot sleep thereunder,   But ever must toss and turn.
10133-8{_}702{_}_How went the battle, I wonder?_   --And that he will never learn!
10133-8{_}703{_}_When winter trees bestrew the path,   Still to the twig a leaf or twain Will cling and weep, not Winter's wrath,   But that foreknown, forlorner pain-- To fall when green leaves come again!_    II.
10133-8{_}704{_}THE MARINE  (_Poitevin_)   The bold Marine comes back from war,         So kind: The bold Marine comes back from war,         So kind: With a raggety coat and a worn-out shoe.
10133-8{_}705{_}"Now, poor Marine, say, whence come you,         All so kind?"
10133-8{_}706{_}I travel back from the war, madame,         So kind: I travel back from the war, madame,         So kind: For a glass of wine and a bowl of whey, 'Tis I will sing you a ballad gay,         All so kind.
10133-8{_}707{_}The bold Marine he sips his whey,         So kind: He sips and he sings his ballad gay,         So kind: But the dame she turns toward the wall, To wipe her tears that fall and fall,         All so kind.
10133-8{_}708{_}What aileth you at my song, madame,         So kind?
10133-8{_}709{_}I hope that I sing no wrong, madame,         So kind?
10133-8{_}710{_}Or grieves it you a beggar should dine On a bowl of whey and the good white wine,         All so kind?
10133-8{_}711{_}It ails me not at your ballad gay,         So kind: It ails me not for the wine and whey,         So kind:  But it ails me sore for the voice and eyes Of a good man long in Paradise.--         Ah, so kind!
10133-8{_}712{_}You have fair children five, madame,         So kind: You have fair children five, madame,         So kind:  Your good man left you children three; Whence came these twain for company,         All so kind?
10133-8{_}713{_}"A letter came from the war, Marine,         So kind: A letter came from the war, Marine,         So kind: A while I wept for the good man dead, But another good man in a while I wed,         All so kind."
10133-8{_}714{_}The bold Marine he drained his glass,         So kind: The bold Marine he drained his glass,         So kind.
10133-8{_}715{_}He said not a word, though the tears they flowed, But back to his regiment took the road,         All so kind.
10133-8{_}716{_}MARY LESLIE   _Before Vittoria, June_ 20, 1813   O Mary Leslie, blithe and shrill   The bugles blew for Spain: And you below the Castle Hill   Stood in the crowd your lane.
10133-8{_}717{_}Then hearts were wild to watch us pass,   Yet laith to let us go!
10133-8{_}718{_}While mine said, "Fare-ye-well, my lass!"
10133-8{_}719{_}And yours, "God keep my Jo!"
10133-8{_}720{_}Here by the bivouac fire, above   These fields of savage play, I'll lift my love to meet thy love   Twa thousand miles away,  Where yonder, yonder by the stars,   Nightlong there rins a burn, And maids with lovers at the wars   May list their wraiths' return.
10133-8{_}721{_}More careless yet my spirit grows   Of fame, more sick of blood: But I can think of Badajoz,   And yet that God is good.
10133-8{_}722{_}Beyond the siege, beyond the stour,   Beyond the sack of towns, I reach to pluck ae lily-floo'r   Where leaders press for crowns.
10133-8{_}723{_}O Mary!
10133-8{_}724{_}lily!
10133-8{_}725{_}bow'd and wet   With mair than mornin's rain!
10133-8{_}726{_}The bugles up the Lawnmarket   Shall sound us home again.
10133-8{_}727{_}Then fare-ye-well, these foreign lands,   And be damn'd their bitter drouth.
10133-8{_}728{_}With your dear face between my hands   And the cup held to my mouth,                            My love, It's clean cup to my mouth!
10133-8{_}729{_}JENIFER'S LOVE   Small is my secret--let it pass--   Small in your life the share I had, Who sat beside you in the class,   Awed by the bright superior lad:     Whom yet with hot and eager face     I prompted when he missed his place.
10133-8{_}730{_}For you the call came swift and soon:   But sometimes in your holidays You meet me trudging home at noon   To dinner through the dusty ways,     And recognized, and with a nod     Passed on, but never guessed--thank God!
10133-8{_}731{_}Truly our ways were separate.
10133-8{_}732{_}I bent myself to hoe and drill,  Yea, with an honest man to mate,   Fulfilling God Almighty's will;     And bore him children.
10133-8{_}733{_}But my prayers     Were yours--and, only after, theirs.
10133-8{_}734{_}While you--still loftier, more remote,   You sprang from stair to stair of fame, And you've a riband on your coat,   And you've a title to your name;     But have you yet a star to shine     Above your bed, as I o'er mine?
10133-8{_}735{_}TWO DUETS   _From "Arion," an unpublished Masque_  I   _He._ Aglai-a!
10133-8{_}736{_}Aglai-a!
10133-8{_}737{_}Sweet, awaken and be glad.
10133-8{_}738{_}_She._ Who is this that calls Aglaia?
10133-8{_}739{_}Is it thou, my dearest lad?
10133-8{_}740{_}_He._ 'Tis Arion, 'tis Arion,       Who calls thee from sleep--     From slumber who bids thee     To follow and number       His kids and his sheep.
10133-8{_}741{_}_She._ Nay, leave to entreat me!
10133-8{_}742{_}If mother should spy on     Us twain, she would beat me.
10133-8{_}743{_}_He._ Then come, my love, come!
10133-8{_}744{_}And hide with Arion        Where green woods are dumb!
10133-8{_}745{_}_She._ Ar-i-on!
10133-8{_}746{_}Ar-i-on!
10133-8{_}747{_}Closer, list!
10133-8{_}748{_}I am afraid!
10133-8{_}749{_}_He._ Whisper, then, thy love Arion,          From thy window, lily maid.
10133-8{_}750{_}_She._ Yet Aglaia, yet Aglaia          Hath heard them debate        Of wooing repenting--        "Who trust to undoing,         Lament them too late."
10133-8{_}751{_}_He._ Nay, nay, when I woo thee,          Thy mother might spy on        All harm I shall do thee.
10133-8{_}752{_}_She._ I come, then--I come!
10133-8{_}753{_}To follow Arion          Where green woods be dumb.
10133-8{_}754{_}SONG        Sparrow of Love, so sharp to peck,       Arrow of Love--I bare my neck       Down to the bosom.
10133-8{_}755{_}See, no fleck        Of blood!
10133-8{_}756{_}I have never a wound; I go       Forth to the greenwood.
10133-8{_}757{_}Yet, heigh-ho!
10133-8{_}758{_}What 'neath my girdle flutters so?
10133-8{_}759{_}'Tis not a bird, and yet hath wings,       'Tis not an arrow, yet it stings;       While in the wound it nests and sings--                                Heigh-ho!
10133-8{_}760{_}_He._ Of Arion, of Arion         That wound thou shalt learn;       What nothings 'tis made of,       And soft pretty soothings         In shade of the fern.
10133-8{_}761{_}_She._ When maids have a mind to,          Man's word they rely on,        Old warning are blind to--          I come, then--I come            To walk with Arion          Where green woods are dumb!
10133-8{_}762{_}II   _He._ Dear my love, and O my love,         And O my love so lately!
10133-8{_}763{_}Did we wander yonder grove         And sit awhile sedately?
10133-8{_}764{_}For either you did there conclude         To do at length as I did,       Or passion's fashion's turn'd a prude,         And troth's an oath derided.
10133-8{_}765{_}_She._ Yea, my love--and nay, my love--          And ask me not to tell, love,        While I delay'd an idle day          What 'twixt us there befell, love.
10133-8{_}766{_}Yet either I did sit beside          And do at length as you did,        Or my delight is lightly by          An idle lie deluded!
10133-8{_}767{_}THE STATUES AND THE TEAR       All night a fountain pleads,          Telling her beads, Her tinkling beads monotonous 'neath the moon;     And where she springs atween,          Two statues lean-- Two Kings, their marble beards with moonlight     strewn.
10133-8{_}768{_}Till hate had frozen speech,         Each hated each, Hated and died, and went unto his place:     And still inveterate         They lean and hate With glare of stone implacable, face to face.
10133-8{_}769{_}One, who bade set them here         In stone austere, To both was dear, and did not guess at all:     Yet with her new-wed lord         Walking the sward Paused, and for two dead friends a tear let fall.
10133-8{_}770{_}She turn'd and went her way.
10133-8{_}771{_}Yet in the spray The shining tear attempts, but cannot lie.
10133-8{_}772{_}Night-long the fountain drips,         But even slips Untold that one bead of her rosary:     While they, who know it would         Lie if it could, Lean on and hate, watching it, eye to eye.
10133-8{_}773{_}NUPTIAL NIGHT   Hush!
10133-8{_}774{_}and again the chatter of the starling     Athwart the lawn!
10133-8{_}775{_}Lean your head close and closer.
10133-8{_}776{_}O my darling!--     It is the dawn.
10133-8{_}777{_}Dawn in the dusk of her dream,     Dream in the hush of her bosom, unclose!
10133-8{_}778{_}Bathed in the eye-bright beam,     Blush to her cheek, be a blossom, a rose!
10133-8{_}779{_}Go, nuptial night!
10133-8{_}780{_}the floor of Ocean tressing     With moon and star; With benediction go and breathe thy blessing     On coasts afar.

10133-8{_}784{_}Go, nuptial night, my breast of hers bereaving!
10133-8{_}785{_}Yet, O, tread soft!
10133-8{_}786{_}Grow day, blithe day, the mountain shoulder heaving     More gold aloft!
10133-8{_}787{_}Gold, rose, bird of the dawn,     All to her balcony gather unseen-- Thrill through the curtain drawn,     Bless her, bedeck her, and bathe her, my Queen!
10133-8{_}788{_}HESPERUS   Down in the street the last late hansoms go     Still westward, but with backward eyes of red     The harlot shuffles to her lonely bed; The tall policeman pauses but to throw A flash into the empty portico;     Then he too passes, and his lonely tread     Links all the long-drawn gas-lights on a thread And ties them to one planet swinging low.

10133-8{_}795{_}Nay, moral man, I tell thee Nay: Nor shall the flaming forts be won   By sneaking negatives alone, By Lenten fast or Ramazàn;   But by the challenge proudly thrown-- _Virtue is that becrowns a Man!_  God, in His Palace resident   Of Bliss, beheld our sinful ball, And charged His own Son innocent   Us to redeem from Adam's fall.

10133-8{_}822{_}THREE MEN OF TRURO  I  E. W. B.
10133-8{_}823{_}_Archbishop of Canterbury: sometime the First Bishop of Truro.
10133-8{_}824{_}October_ 1896             The Church's outpost on a neck of land--              By ebb of faith the foremost left the last--            Dull, starved of hope, we watched the driven sand              Blown through the hour-glass, covering our past,                Counting no hours to our relief--no hail                Across the hills, and on the sea no sail!
10133-8{_}825{_}Sick of monotonous days we lost account,                In fitful dreams remembering days of old And nights--th' erect Archangel on the Mount             With sword that drank the dawn; the Vase of Gold                The moving Grail athwart the starry fields                Where all the heavenly spearmen clashed their                    shields.
10133-8{_}826{_}In dereliction by the deafening shore             We sought no more aloft, but sunk our eyes,           Probing the sea for food, the earth for ore.             Ah, yet had one good soldier of the skies               Burst through the wrack reporting news of them,               How had we run and kissed his garment's hem!
10133-8{_}827{_}Nay, but he came!
10133-8{_}828{_}Nay, but he stood and cried,             Panting with joy and the fierce fervent race,           "Arm, arm!
10133-8{_}829{_}for Christ returns!"
10133-8{_}830{_}--and all our pride,             Our ancient pride, answered that eager face:               "Repair His battlements!--Your Christ is near!"
10133-8{_}831{_}And, half in dream, we raised the soldiers' cheer.
10133-8{_}832{_}Far, as we flung that challenge, fled the ghosts--             Back, as we built, the obscene foe withdrew--           High to the song of hammers sang the hosts             Of Heaven--and lo!
10133-8{_}833{_}the daystar, and a new               Dawn with its chalice and its wind as wine;               And youth was hope, and life once more divine!
10133-8{_}834{_}*       *       *       *       *            Day, and hot noon, and now the evening glow,             And 'neath our scaffolding the city spread           Twilit, with rain-wash'd roofs, and--hark!--below,             One late bell tolling.
10133-8{_}835{_}"Dead?
10133-8{_}836{_}Our Captain dead?"
10133-8{_}837{_}Nay, here with us he fronts the westering sun               With shaded eyes and counts the wide fields won.
10133-8{_}838{_}Aloft with us!
10133-8{_}839{_}And while another stone              Swings to its socket, haste with trowel and hod!

10133-8{_}843{_}B. D.  _Canon Residentiary and Precentor of Truro December_ 1903            Many had builded, and, the building done,             Through our adornèd gates with din           Came Prince and Priest, with pipe and clarion             Leading the right God in.
10133-8{_}844{_}Yet, had the perfect temple quickened then             And whispered us between our song,           _"Give God the praise.
10133-8{_}845{_}To whom of living men             Shall next our thanks belong?
10133-8{_}846{_}"_            Then had the few, the very few, that wist             His Atlantean labour, swerved           Their eyes to seek, and in the triumph missed,             The man that most deserved.
10133-8{_}847{_}He only of us was incorporate             In all that fabric; stone by stone           Had built his life in her, had made his fate             And her perfection one;            Given all he had; and now--when all was given--             Far spent, within a private shade,           Heard the loud organ pealing praise to Heaven,             And learned why man is made.--           To break his strength, yet always to be brave;            To preach, and act, the Crucified ...
10133-8{_}848{_}Sweep by, O Prince and Prelate, up the nave,            And fill it with your pride!
10133-8{_}849{_}Better than ye what made th' old temples great,            Because he loved, he understood;          Indignant that his darling, less in state,            Should lack a martyr's blood.
10133-8{_}850{_}She hath it now.
10133-8{_}851{_}O mason, strip away             Her scaffolding, the flower disclose!
10133-8{_}852{_}Lay by the tools with his o'er-wearied clay--           But She shall bloom unto its Judgment Day,             His ever-living Rose!
10133-8{_}853{_}III  C. W. S.  _The Fourth Bishop of Truro May_ 1912            Prince of courtesy defeated,           Heir of hope untimely cheated,           Throned awhile he sat, and, seated,            Saw his Cornish round him gather;           "Teach us how to live, good Father!"
10133-8{_}854{_}How to die he taught us rather:  Heard the startling trumpet sound him,           Smiled upon the feast around him,           Rose, and wrapp'd his coat, and bound him            When beyond the awful surges,           Bathed in dawn on Syrian verges,           God!
10133-8{_}855{_}thy star, thy Cross emerges.
10133-8{_}856{_}_And so sing we all to it--_            Crux, in coelo lux superna,           Sis in carnis hac taberna           Mihi pedibus lucerna:            Quo vexillum dux cohortis           Sistet, super flumen Mortis,           Te, flammantibus in portis!
10133-8{_}857{_}ALMA MATER            _Know you her secret none can utter?_             Hers of the Book, the tripled Crown?
10133-8{_}858{_}Still on the spire the pigeons flutter,             Still by the gateway flits the gown;           Still on the street, from corbel and gutter,             Faces of stone look down.
10133-8{_}859{_}Faces of stone, and stonier faces--             Some from library windows wan           Forth on her gardens, her green spaces,             Peer and turn to their books anon.
10133-8{_}860{_}Hence, my Muse, from the green oases             Gather the tent, begone!
10133-8{_}861{_}Nay, should she by the pavement linger             Under the rooms where once she played,           Who from the feast would rise to fling her             One poor _sou_ for her serenade?
10133-8{_}862{_}One short laugh for the antic finger             Thrumming a lute-string frayed?
10133-8{_}863{_}Once, my dear--but the world was young then--             Magdalen elms and Trinity limes--           Lissom the blades and the backs that swung then,             Eight good men in the good old times--           Careless we, and the chorus flung then             Under St Mary's chimes!
10133-8{_}864{_}Reins lay loose and the ways led random--             Christ Church meadow and Iffley track,           "Idleness horrid and dog-cart" (tandem),             Aylesbury grind and Bicester pack--           Pleasant our lines, and faith!
10133-8{_}865{_}we scanned 'em:             Having that artless knack.
10133-8{_}866{_}Come, old limmer, the times grow colder;             Leaves of the creeper redden and fall.
10133-8{_}867{_}Was it a hand then clapped my shoulder?--             Only the wind by the chapel wall!
10133-8{_}868{_}Dead leaves drift on the lute ...
10133-8{_}869{_}So, fold her             Under the faded shawl.
10133-8{_}870{_}Never we wince, though none deplore us,             We who go reaping that we sowed;           Cities at cock-crow wake before us--             Hey, for the lilt of the London road!
10133-8{_}871{_}One look back, and a rousing chorus!
10133-8{_}872{_}Never a palinode!
10133-8{_}873{_}Still on her spire the pigeons hover;             Still by her gateway haunts the gown.
10133-8{_}874{_}Ah!
10133-8{_}875{_}but her secret?
10133-8{_}876{_}You, young lover,             Drumming her old ones forth from town,           Know you the secret none discover?
10133-8{_}877{_}Tell it--when _you_ go down.
10133-8{_}878{_}Yet if at length you seek her, prove her,             Lean to her whispers never so nigh;           Yet if at last not less her lover             You in your hansom leave the High;           Down from her towers a ray shall hover--             Touch you, a passer-by!
10133-8{_}879{_}CHRISTMAS EVE       Friend, old friend in the Manse by the fireside sitting,        Hour by hour while the grey ash drips from the log;      You with a book on your knee, your wife with her knitting,      Silent both, and between you, silent, the dog.
10133-8{_}880{_}Silent here in the south sit I; and, leaning,        One sits watching the fire, with chin upon hand;      Gazes deep in its heart--but ah!
10133-8{_}881{_}its meaning        Rather I read in the shadows and understand.
10133-8{_}882{_}Dear, kind she is; and daily dearer, kinder,        Love shuts the door on the lamp and our two selves:  Not my stirring awakened the flame that behind her        Lit up a face in the leathern dusk of the shelves.
10133-8{_}883{_}Veterans are my books, with tarnished gilding:        Yet there is one gives back to the winter grate      Gold of a sunset flooding a college building,        Gold of an hour I waited--as now I wait--       For a light step on the stair, a girl's low laughter,        Rustle of silk, shy knuckles tapping the oak,      Dinner and mirth upsetting my rooms and, after,        Music, waltz upon waltz, till the June day broke.
10133-8{_}884{_}Where is her laughter now?
10133-8{_}885{_}Old tarnished covers--        You that reflect her with fresh young face unchanged--      Tell that we met, that we parted, not as lovers;        Time, chance, brought us together, and these estranged.
10133-8{_}886{_}Loyal were we to the mood of the moment granted,        Bruised not its bloom, but danced on the wave of its joy;      Passion--wisdom--fell back like a fence enchanted,        Ringing a floor for us both--whole Heaven for the boy!
10133-8{_}887{_}Where is she now?
10133-8{_}888{_}Regretted not, though departed,        Blessings attend and follow her all her days!
10133-8{_}889{_}--Look to your hound: he dreams of the hares he started,        Whines, and awakes, and stretches his limbs to the blaze.
10133-8{_}890{_}Far old friend in the Manse, by the green ash peeling        Flake by flake from the heat in the Yule log's core,      Look past the woman you love.
10133-8{_}891{_}On wall and ceiling        Climbs not a trellis of roses--and ghosts--of yore?
10133-8{_}892{_}Thoughts, thoughts!
10133-8{_}893{_}Whistle them back like hounds returning--        Mark how her needles pause at a sound upstairs.
10133-8{_}894{_}Time for bed, and to leave the log's heart burning!
10133-8{_}895{_}Give ye good-night, but first thank God in your prayers!
10133-8{_}896{_}THE ROOT       Deep, Love, yea, very deep.
10133-8{_}897{_}And in the dark exiled, I have no sense of light but still to creep And know the breast, but not the eyes.
10133-8{_}898{_}Thy child Saw ne'er his mother near, nor if she smiled;       But only feels her weep.
10133-8{_}899{_}Yet clouds and branches green       There be aloft, somewhere, And winds, and angel birds that build between, As I believe--and I will not despair; For faith is evidence of things not seen.
10133-8{_}900{_}Love!
10133-8{_}901{_}if I could be there!
10133-8{_}902{_}I will be patient, dear.
10133-8{_}903{_}Perchance some part of me Puts forth aloft and feels the rushing year And shades the bird, and is that happy tree Then were it strength to serve and not appear,       And bliss, though blind, to be.
10133-8{_}904{_}TO A FRIEND WHO SENT ME A BOX OF VIOLETS   Nay, more than violets These thoughts of thine, friend!
10133-8{_}905{_}Rather thy reedy brook-- Taw's tributary-- At midnight murmuring, Descried them, the delicate Dark-eyed goddesses, There by his cressy bed Dissolved and dreaming Dreams that distilled into dew All the purple of night, All the shine of a planet.
10133-8{_}906{_}Whereat he whispered; And they arising--  Of day's forget-me-nots The duskier sisters-- Descended, relinquished The orchard, the trout-pool, Torridge and Tamar, The Druid circles, Sheepfolds of Dartmoor, Granite and sandstone; By Roughtor, Dozmare, Down the vale of the Fowey Moving in silence, Brushing the nightshade By bridges cyclopean, By Trevenna, Treverbyn, Lawharne and Largin, By Glynn, Lanhydrock, Restormel, Lostwithiel, Dark wood, dim water, dreaming town; Down the vale of the Fowey To the tidal water Washing the feet Of fair St Winnow-- Each, in her exile Musing the message, Passed, as the starlit Shadow of Ruth from the land of the Moabite.
10133-8{_}907{_}So they came, Valley-born, valley-nurtured-- Came to the tideway The jetties, the anchorage, The salt wind piping, Snoring in Equinox, By ships at anchor, By quays tormented, Storm-bitten streets; Came to the Haven Crying, "Ah, shelter us, The strayed ambassadors, Love's lost legation On a comfortless coast!"
10133-8{_}908{_}Nay, but a little sleep, A little folding Of petals to the lull Of quiet rainfalls-- Here in my garden, In angle sheltered From north and east wind-- Softly shall recreate The courage of charity, Henceforth not to me only Breathing the message.
10133-8{_}909{_}Clean-breath'd Sirens!
10133-8{_}910{_}Hencefore the mariner.
10133-8{_}911{_}TO A FRIEND   Here in the fairway Fetching--foul of keel, Long-stray but fortunate-- Out of the fogs, the vast Atlantic solitudes.
10133-8{_}912{_}Shall, by the hawser-pin Waiting the signal _Leave--go--anchor!_ Scent the familiar, The unforgettable Fragrance of home; So in a long breath Bless us unknowing: Bless them, the violets, Bless me, the gardener, Bless thee, the giver.
10133-8{_}913{_}OF THREE CHILDREN  OF THREE CHILDREN CHOOSING A CHAPLET OF VERSE   You and I and Burd so blithe--   Burd so blithe, and you, and I-- The Mower he would whet his scythe   Before the dew was dry.
10133-8{_}914{_}And he woke soon, but we woke soon   And drew the nursery blind, All wondering at the waning moon   With the small June roses twined: Low in her cradle swung the moon   With an elfin dawn behind.
10133-8{_}915{_}In whispers, while our elders slept,   We knelt and said our prayers, And dress'd us and on tiptoe crept   Adown the creaking stairs.
10133-8{_}916{_}The world's possessors lay abed,   And all the world was ours-- "Nay, nay, but hark!
10133-8{_}917{_}the Mower's tread!
10133-8{_}918{_}And we must save the flowers!"
10133-8{_}919{_}The Mower knew not rest nor haste--   That old unweary man: But we were young.
10133-8{_}920{_}We paused and raced   And gather'd while we ran.
10133-8{_}921{_}O youth is careless, youth is fleet,   With heart and wing of bird!
10133-8{_}922{_}The lark flew up beneath our feet,   To his copse the pheasant whirr'd;  The cattle from their darkling lairs   Heaved up and stretch'd themselves; Almost they trod at unawares   Upon the busy elves  That dropp'd their spools of gossamer,   To dangle and to dry, And scurried home to the hollow fir   Where the white owl winks an eye.
10133-8{_}923{_}Nor you, nor I, nor Burd so blithe   Had driven them in this haste; But the old, old man, so lean and lithe,   That afar behind us paced; So lean and lithe, with shoulder'd scythe,   And a whetstone at his waist.
10133-8{_}924{_}Within the gate, in a grassy round   Whence they had earliest flown, He upside-down'd his scythe, and ground   Its edge with careful hone.
10133-8{_}925{_}But we heeded not, if we heard, the sound,   For the world was ours alone; The world was ours!--and with a bound   The conquering Sun upshone!
10133-8{_}926{_}And while as from his level ray   We stood our eyes to screen.
10133-8{_}927{_}The world was not as yesterday   Our homelier world had been-- So grey and golden-green it lay   All in his quiet sheen, That wove the gold into the grey,   The grey into the green.
10133-8{_}928{_}Sure never hand of Puck, nor wand   Of Mab the fairies' queen, Nor prince nor peer of fairyland Had power to weave that wide riband   Of the grey, the gold, the green.
10133-8{_}929{_}But the Gods of Greece had been before   And walked our meads along, The great authentic Gods of yore That haunt the earth from shore to shore   Trailing their robes of song.
10133-8{_}930{_}And where a sandall'd foot had brush'd,   And where a scarfed hem, The flowers awoke from sleep and rush'd   Like children after them.
10133-8{_}931{_}Pell-mell they poured by vale and stream,   By lawn and steepy brae-- "O children, children!
10133-8{_}932{_}while you dream,   Your flowers run all away!"
10133-8{_}933{_}But afar and abed and sleepily   The children heard us call; And Burd so blithe and you and I   Must be gatherers for all.
10133-8{_}934{_}The meadow-sweet beside the hedge,   The dog-rose and the vetch, The sworded iris 'mid the sedge,   The mallow by the ditch--  With these, and by the wimpling burn,   Where the midges danced in reels, With the watermint and the lady fern   We brimm'd out wicker creels:  Till, all so heavily they weigh'd,   On a bank we flung us down, Shook out our treasures 'neath the shade   And wove this Triple Crown.
10133-8{_}935{_}Flower after flower--for some there were   The noonday heats had dried, And some were dear yet could not bear   A lovelier cheek beside, And some were perfect past compare-- Ah, darlings!
10133-8{_}936{_}what a world of care   It cost us to decide!
10133-8{_}937{_}Natheless we sang in sweet accord,   Each bending o'er her brede-- "O there be flowers in Oxenford,   And flowers be north of Tweed, And flowers there be on earthly sward   That owe no mortal seed!"
10133-8{_}938{_}And these, the brightest that we wove,   Were Innocence and Truth, And holy Peace and angel Love,   Glad Hope and gentle Ruth.
10133-8{_}939{_}Ah, bind them fast with triple twine Of Memory, the wild woodbine That still, being human, stays divine,   And alone is age's youth!...
10133-8{_}940{_}But hark!
10133-8{_}941{_}but look!
10133-8{_}942{_}the warning rook   Wings home in level flight; The children tired with play and book   Have kiss'd and call'd Good-night!
10133-8{_}943{_}Ah, sisters, look!
10133-8{_}944{_}What fields be these   That lie so sad and shorn?
10133-8{_}945{_}What hand has cut our coppices, And thro' the trimm'd, the ruin'd, trees   Lets wail a wind forlorn?
10133-8{_}946{_}'Tis Time, 'tis Time has done this crime   And laid our meadows waste-- The bent unwearied tyrant Time,   That knows nor rest nor haste.
10133-8{_}947{_}Yet courage, children; homeward bring   Your hearts, your garlands high; For we have dared to do a thing   That shall his worst defy.
10133-8{_}948{_}We cannot nail the dial's hand;   We cannot bind the sun By Gibeon to stay and stand,   Or the moon o'er Ajalon;  We cannot blunt th' abhorred shears,   Nor shift the skeins of Fate, Nor say unto the posting years   "Ye shall not desolate."
10133-8{_}949{_}We cannot cage the lion's rage,   Nor teach the turtle-dove Beside what well his moan to tell   Or to haunt one only grove; But the lion's brood will range for food   As the fledged bird will rove.
10133-8{_}950{_}And east and west we three may wend--   Yet we a wreath have wound For us shall wind withouten end   The wide, wide world around:  Be it east or west, and ne'er so far, In east or west shall peep no star, No blossom break from ground, But minds us of the wreath we wove Of innocence and holy love   That in the meads we found, And handsell'd from the Mower's scythe, And bound with memory's living withe-- You and I and Burd so blithe--   Three maidens on a mound: And all of happiness was ours Shall find remembrance 'mid the flowers, Shall take revival from the flowers   And by the flowers be crown'd.
10133-8{_}951{_}EPILOGUE  TO A MOTHER, ON SEEING HER SMILE REPEATED IN HER DAUGHTER'S EYES   A thousand songs I might have made   Of You, and only You; A thousand thousand tongues of fire That trembled down a golden wire   To lamp the night with stars, to braid The morning bough with dew.
10133-8{_}952{_}Within the greenwood girl and boy   Had loiter'd to their lure, And men in cities closed their books To dream of Spring and running brooks And all that ever was of joy   For manhood to abjure.
10133-8{_}953{_}And I'd have made them strong, so strong   Outlasting towers and towns-- Millennial shepherds 'neath the thorn Had piped them to a world reborn, And danced Delight the dale along   And up the daisied downs.
10133-8{_}954{_}A thousand songs I might have made...
10133-8{_}955{_}But you required them not; Content to reign your little while Ere, abdicating with a smile, You pass'd into a shade, a shade   Immortal--and forgot!

10133-8{_}1057{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10133-8{_}1058{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10133-8{_}1059{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.

10133-8{_}1067{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10133-8{_}1068{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10133-8{_}1069{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10133-8{_}1070{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10133-8{_}1071{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10133-8{_}1072{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10133-8{_}1073{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10133-8{_}1074{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10133-8{_}1075{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10133-8{_}1076{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10133-8{_}1077{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10133-8{_}1078{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10133-8{_}1079{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10133-8{_}1080{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10133-8{_}1081{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10133-8{_}1082{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10133-8{_}1083{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
