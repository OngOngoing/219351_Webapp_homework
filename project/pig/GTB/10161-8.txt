10161-8{_}2{_}The general reader will, I hope, be gratified to find that its pages display no pedantic or scholastic traits.
10161-8{_}3{_}His pleasure in the poetry itself will not be distracted by a marginal numbering of the lines; by index-figures and footnotes; or by antiquated peculiarities of spelling, capitalization, and elision.
10161-8{_}4{_}Except where literal conventions are essential to the poet's purpose,--as in _The Castle of Indolence, The Schoolmistress_, or Chatterton's poems,--I have followed modern usage.
10161-8{_}5{_}Dialect words are explained in the glossary; and the student who may wish to consult the context of any passage will find the necessary references in the unusually full table of contents.
10161-8{_}6{_}Whenever the title of a poem gives too vague a notion of its substance, or whenever its substance is miscellaneous, I have supplied [bracketed] captions for the extracts; except for these, there is nothing on the pages of the text besides the poets' own words.
10161-8{_}7{_}Originality is not the proper characteristic of an anthologist, and in the choice of extracts I have rarely indulged my personal likings when they conflicted with time-honored preferences; yet this anthology,--the first published in a projected series of four or five volumes comprising the English poets from Elizabethan to Victorian times,--has certain minor features that may be deemed objectionably novel.
10161-8{_}8{_}Much the greater portion of the volume has of course, as usual, been given to those poems (by Pope, Thomson, Collins, Gray, Goldsmith, Crabbe, Cowper, and Burns) which have been loved or admired from their day to our own.
10161-8{_}9{_}But I have ventured to admit also a few which, though forgotten to-day, either were popular in the eighteenth century or possess marked historical significance.
10161-8{_}10{_}In other words, I present not solely what the twentieth century considers enduringly great in the poetry of the eighteenth, but also a little--proportionately very little--of what the eighteenth century itself (perhaps mistakenly) considered interesting.
10161-8{_}11{_}This secondary purpose accounts for my inclusion of passages from such neglected authors as Mandeville, Brooke, Day, and Darwin.
10161-8{_}12{_}The passages of this sort are too infrequent to annoy him who reads for aesthetic pleasure only; and to the student they will illustrate movements in the spirit of the age which would otherwise be unrepresented, and which, as the historical introduction points out, are an integral part of its thought and feeling.
10161-8{_}13{_}The inclusion of passages from "Ossian," though almost unprecedented, requires, I think, no defense against the literal-minded protest that they are written in "prose."
10161-8{_}14{_}Students of poetical history will find it illuminating to read the passages in chronological order (irrespective of authorship); and in order to facilitate this method I have given in the table of contents the date of each poem.

10161-8{_}132{_}1798)     INTRODUCTION  I. ORTHODOXY AND CLASSICISM QUIESCENT (1700-1725) The clearest portrayal of the prominent features of an age may sometimes be seen in poems which reveal what men desire to be rather than what they are; and which express sentiments typical, even commonplace, rather than individual.
10161-8{_}133{_}John Pomfret's _Choice_ (1700) is commonplace indeed; it was never deemed great, but it was remarkably popular.
10161-8{_}134{_}"No composition in our language," opined Dr. Johnson, "has been oftener perused,"--an opinion quite incredible until one perceives how intimately the poem harmonizes with the prevalent mood of its contemporary readers.
10161-8{_}135{_}It was written by a clergyman (a circumstance not insignificant); its form is the heroic couplet; its content is a wish, for a peaceful and civilized mode of existence.
10161-8{_}136{_}And what; is believed to satisfy that longing?
10161-8{_}137{_}A life of leisure; the necessaries of comfort plentifully provided, but used temperately; a country-house upon a hillside, not too distant from the city; a little garden bordered by a rivulet; a quiet-study furnished with the classical Roman poets; the society of a few friends, men who know the world as well as books, who are loyal to their nation and their church, and whose; conversation is intellectually vigorous but always polite; the occasional companionship of a woman of virtue, wit, and poise of manner; and, above all, the avoidance of public or private contentions.
10161-8{_}138{_}Culture and peace--and the greater of these is peace!
10161-8{_}139{_}The sentiment characterizes the first quarter of the eighteenth century.
10161-8{_}140{_}The poets of that period had received an abundant heritage from the Elizabethans, the Cavaliers, Dryden, and Milton.
10161-8{_}141{_}It was a poetry of passionate love, chivalric honor, indignant satire, and sublime faith.
10161-8{_}142{_}Much of it they admired, but their admiration was tempered with fear.
10161-8{_}143{_}They heard therein the tones of violent generations,--of men whose intensity, though yielding extraordinary beauty and grandeur, yielded also obscurity and extravagance; men whom the love of women too often impelled to utter fantastic hyperbole, and the love of honor to glorify preposterous adventures; quarrelsome men, who assailed their opponents with rancorous personalities; doctrinaires, who employed their fiery energy of mind in the creation of rigid systems of religion and government; uncompromising men, who devoted to the support of those systems their fortunes and lives, drenched the land in the blood of a civil war, executed a king, presently restored his dynasty, and finally exiled it again, thus maintaining during half a century a general insecurity of life and property which checked the finer growths of civilization.
10161-8{_}144{_}Their successors trusted that the compromise of 1688 had reduced political and sectarian affairs to a state of calm equilibrium; and they desired to cultivate the fruits of serenity by fostering in all things the spirit of moderation.
10161-8{_}145{_}In poetry, as in life, they tended more and more to discountenance manifestations of vehemence.
10161-8{_}146{_}Even the poetry of Dryden, with its reflections of the stormy days through which he had struggled, seemed to them, though gloriously leading the way toward perfection, to fall short of equability of temper and smoothness of form.
10161-8{_}147{_}To work like Defoe's _True-Born Englishman_ (1701) and _Hymn to the Pillory_ (1703), combative in spirit and free in style, they gave only guarded and temporary approval.
10161-8{_}148{_}Inevitably the change of mood entailed losses.
10161-8{_}149{_}Sir Henry Wotton's _Character of a Happy Life_ (c. 1614) treats the same theme as Pomfret's _Choice_; but Pomfret's contemporaries were rarely if ever visited by such gleams as shine in Wotton's lines describing the happy man as one    who never understood   How deepest wounds are given by praise,  and as one    Who God doth late and early pray   More of his grace than gifts to lend.
10161-8{_}150{_}Such touches of penetrative wisdom and piety, like many other precious qualities, are of an age that had passed.
10161-8{_}151{_}In the poetry of 1700-1725, religion forgoes mysticism and exaltation; the intellectual life, daring and subtlety; the imagination, exuberance and splendor.
10161-8{_}152{_}Enthusiasm for moral ideals declines into steadfast approval of ethical principles.
10161-8{_}153{_}Yet these were changes in tone and manner rather than in fundamental views.
10161-8{_}154{_}The poets of the period were conservatives.
10161-8{_}155{_}They were shocked by the radicalism of Mandeville, the Nietzsche of his day, who derided the generally accepted moralities as shallow delusions, and who by means of a clever fable supported a materialistic theory which implied that in the struggle for existence nothing but egotism could succeed:    Fools only strive   To make a great and honest hive.
10161-8{_}156{_}Obloquy buried him; he was a sensational exception to the rule.
10161-8{_}157{_}As a body, the poets of his time retained the orthodox traditions concerning God, Man, and Nature.
10161-8{_}158{_}Their theology is evidenced by Addison, Watts, and Parnell.
10161-8{_}159{_}It is a Christianity that has not ceased to be stern and majestic.
10161-8{_}160{_}In Addison's _Divine Ode_, the planets of the firmament proclaim a Creator whose power knows no bounds.
10161-8{_}161{_}In the hymns of Isaac Watts, God is as of old a jealous God, obedience to whose eternal will may require the painful sacrifice of temporal earthly affections, even the sacrifice of our love for our fellow-creatures; a just God, who by the law of his own nature cannot save unrepentant sin from eternal retribution; yet an adored God, whose providence protects the faithful amid stormy vicissitudes,--    Under the shadow of whose throne   The saints have dwelt secure.
10161-8{_}162{_}Spirits as gentle and kindly as Parnell insist that the only approach to happiness lies through a religious discipline of the feelings, and protest that death is not to be feared but welcomed--as the passage from a troublous existence to everlasting peace.
10161-8{_}163{_}In most of the poetry of the time, religion, if at all noticeable, is a mere undercurrent; but whenever it rises to the surface, it reflects the ancient creed.
10161-8{_}164{_}Traditional too is the general conception of human character.
10161-8{_}165{_}Man is still thought of as a complex of lofty and mean qualities, widely variable in their proportion yet in no instance quite dissevered.
10161-8{_}166{_}To interpret--not God or Nature--but this self-contradictory being, in both his higher and his lower manifestations and possibilities, remains the chief vocation of the poets.
10161-8{_}167{_}They have not ceased the endeavor to lend dignity to life by portraying its nobler features.
10161-8{_}168{_}Addison, in _The Campaign_, glorifies the national hero whose brilliant victories thwarted the great monarch of France on his seemingly invincible career toward the hegemony of Europe, the warrior Marlborough, serene of soul amid the horror and confusion of battle.
10161-8{_}169{_}Tickell, in his noble elegy on Addison, not only, while voicing his own grief, illustrates the beauty of devoted friendship, but also, when eulogizing his subject, holds up to admiration, as a type to be revered, the wise moralist, cultured and versatile man of letters, and adept in the art of virtuous life.
10161-8{_}170{_}Pope, in the most ambitious literary effort of the day, his translation of the _Iliad_, labors to enrich the treasury of English poetry with an epic that sheds radiance upon the ideals and manners of an heroic age.
10161-8{_}171{_}In such attempts to exalt the grander phases of human existence, the poets were, however, owing to their fear of enthusiasm, never quite successful.
10161-8{_}172{_}It is significant that though most critics consider Pope's Homer no better than a mediocre performance, none denies that his _Rape of the Lock_ is, in its kind, perfection.
10161-8{_}173{_}Here, as in the _vers de société_ of Matthew Prior and Ambrose Philips, the age was illuminating with the graces of poetry something it really understood and delighted in,--the life of leisure and fashion; and here, accordingly, is its most original and masterly work.
10161-8{_}174{_}_The Rape of the Lock_ is the product of a society which had the good sense and good breeding to try to laugh away incipient quarrels, and which greeted with airy banter the indiscreet act of an enamoured young gallant,--the kind of act which vulgarity meets with angry lampoons or rude violence.
10161-8{_}175{_}The poem is an idyll quite as much as a satire.
10161-8{_}176{_}The follies of fashionable life are treated with nothing severer than light raillery; and its actually distasteful features,--its lapses into stupidity, its vacuous restlessness, its ennui,--are cunningly suppressed.
10161-8{_}177{_}But all that made it seem the height of human felicity is preserved, and enhanced in charm.
10161-8{_}178{_}"Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames," one glides to Hampton Court amid youth and gayety and melting music; and for the nonce this realm of "airs, flounces, and furbelows," of merry chit-chat, and of pleasurable excitement, seems as important as it is to those exquisite creatures of fancy that hover about the heroine, assiduous guardians of her "graceful ease and sweetness void of pride."
10161-8{_}179{_}Of that admired world likewise are the lovers that Matthew Prior creates, who woo neither with stormy passion nor with mawkish whining, but in a courtly manner; lovers who deem an epigram a finer tribute than a sigh.
10161-8{_}180{_}So the tender fondness of a middle-aged man for an infant is elevated above the commonplace by assuming the tone of playful gallantry.
10161-8{_}181{_}The ignobler aspects of life,--nutriment of the comic sense,--were not ignored.
10161-8{_}182{_}The new school of poets, however deficient in the higher vision, were keen observers of actuality; and among them the satiric spirit, though not militant as in the days of Dryden, was still active.
10161-8{_}183{_}The value which they attached to social culture is again shown in the persistence of the sentiment that as man grew in civility he became less ridiculous.
10161-8{_}184{_}The peccadilloes of the upper classes they treated with comparatively gentle humor, and aimed their strokes of satire chiefly against the lower.
10161-8{_}185{_}Rarely did they idealize humble folk: Gay's _Sweet William's Farewett to Black-Eyed Susan_ is in this respect exceptional.
10161-8{_}186{_}Their typical attitude is seen in his _Shepherd's Week_, with its ludicrous picture of rustic superstition and naive amorousness; and in Allan Ramsay's _Gentle Shepherd_, where the pastoral, once remote from life, assumes the manners and dialect of the countryside in order to arouse laughter.
10161-8{_}187{_}The obvious fact that these poets centered their attention upon Man, particularly in his social life, and that their most memorable productions are upon that theme, led posterity to complain that they wholly lacked interest in Nature, were incapable of delineating it, and did not feel its sacred influence.
10161-8{_}188{_}The last point in the indictment,--and the last only,--is quite true.
10161-8{_}189{_}No one who understood and believed, as they did, the doctrines of orthodoxy could consistently ascribe divinity to Nature.
10161-8{_}190{_}To them Nature exhibited the power of God, but not his will; and the soul of Man gained its clearest moral light directly from a _super_natural source.
10161-8{_}191{_}This did not, however, imply that Nature was negligible.
10161-8{_}192{_}The celebrated essays of Addison on the pleasures of the imagination (_Spectator_, Nos.
10161-8{_}193{_}411-414) base those pleasures upon the grandeur of Nature; upon its variety and freshness, as of "groves, fields, and meadows in the opening of the Spring"; and upon its beauty of form and color.
10161-8{_}194{_}The works of Nature, declares Addison, surpass those of art, and accordingly "we always find the poet in love with a country life."
10161-8{_}195{_}Such was the theory; the practice was not out of accord therewith.
10161-8{_}196{_}Passages appreciative of the lovelier aspects of Nature, and not, despite the current preference for general rather than specific terms, inaccurate as descriptions, were written between 1700 and 1726 by Addison himself, Pope, Lady Winchilsea, Gay, Parnell, Dyer, and many others.
10161-8{_}197{_}Nature worshippers they were not.
10161-8{_}198{_}Nature lovers they can be justly styled,--if such love may discriminate between the beautiful and the ugly aspects of the natural.
10161-8{_}199{_}It is characteristic that Berkeley, in his _Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America_, does not indulge the fancy that the wilderness is of itself uplifting; it requires, he assumes, the aid of human culture and wisdom,--"the rise of empire and of arts,"--to develop its potentialities.
10161-8{_}200{_}A generation which placidly adhered to the orthodox sentiments of its predecessors was of course not moved to revolutionize poetical theories or forms.
10161-8{_}201{_}Its theories are authoritatively stated in Pope's _Essay on Criticism_; they embrace principles of good sense and mature taste which are easier to condemn than to confute or supersede.
10161-8{_}202{_}In poetical diction the age cultivated clearness, propriety, and dignity: it rejected words so minutely particular as to suggest pedantry or specialization; and it refused to sacrifice simple appropriateness to inaccurate vigor of utterance or meaningless beauty of sound.
10161-8{_}203{_}Its favorite measure, the decasyllabic couplet, moulded by Jonson, Sandys, Waller, Denham, and Dryden, it accepted reverently, as an heirloom not to be essentially altered but to be polished until it shone more brightly than ever.
10161-8{_}204{_}Pope perfected this form, making it at once more artistic and more natural.
10161-8{_}205{_}He discountenanced on the one hand run-on lines, alexandrines, hiatus, and sequence of monosyllables; on the other, the resort to expletives and the mechanical placing of caesura.
10161-8{_}206{_}If his verse does not move with the "long resounding pace" of Dryden at his best, it has a movement better suited to the drawing-room: it is what Oliver Wendell Holmes terms    The straight-backed measure with the stately stride.
10161-8{_}207{_}Thus in form as in substance the poetry of the period voiced the mood, not of carefree youth, nor yet of vehement early manhood, but of still vigorous middle age,--a phase of existence perhaps less ingratiating than others, but one which has its rightful hour in the life of the race as of the individual.
10161-8{_}208{_}The sincere and artistic expression of its feelings will be denied poetical validity only by those whose capacity for appreciating the varieties of poetry is limited by their lack of experience or by narrowness of sympathetic imagination.
10161-8{_}209{_}II.
10161-8{_}210{_}ORTHODOXY AND CLASSICISM ASSAILED (1726-1750)  During the second quarter of the century, Pope and his group remained dominant in the realm of poetry; but their mood was no longer pacific.
10161-8{_}211{_}Their work showed a growing seriousness and acerbity.
10161-8{_}212{_}Partly the change was owing to disappointment: life had not become so highly cultured, literature had not prospered so much, nor displayed so broad a diffusion of intelligence and taste, as had been expected.
10161-8{_}213{_}Pope's _Dunciad, Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_, and ironic satire on the state of literature under "Augustus" (George II, the "snuffy old drone from the German hive"), brilliantly express this indignation with the intellectual and literary shortcomings of the times.
10161-8{_}214{_}A cause of the change of mood which was to be of more lasting consequence than the failure of the age to put the traditional ideal more generally into practice, was the appearance of a distinctly new ideal,--one which undermined the very foundations of the old.
10161-8{_}215{_}This new spirit may be termed sentimentalism.
10161-8{_}216{_}In prose literature it had already been stirring for about twenty-five years, changing the tone of comedy, entering into some of the periodical essays, and assuming a philosophic character in the works of Lord Shaftesbury.
10161-8{_}217{_}Its chief doctrines, rhapsodically promulgated by this amiable and original enthusiast, were that the universe and all its creatures constitute a perfect harmony; and that Man, owing to his innate moral and aesthetic sense, needs no supernatural revelation of religious or ethical truth, because if he will discard the prejudices of tradition, he will instinctively, when face to face with Nature, recognize the Spirit which dwells therein,--and, correspondingly, when in the presence of a good deed he will recognize its morality.
10161-8{_}218{_}In other words.
10161-8{_}219{_}God and Nature are one; and Man is instinctively good, his cardinal virtue being the love of humanity, his true religion the love of Nature.
10161-8{_}220{_}Be therefore of good cheer: evil merely appears to exist, sin is a figment of false psychology; lead mankind to return to the natural, and they will find happiness.
10161-8{_}221{_}The poetical possibilities of sentimentalism were not grasped by any noteworthy poet before Thomson.
10161-8{_}222{_}_The Seasons_ was an innovation, and its novelty lay not so much in the choice of the subject as in the interpretation.
10161-8{_}223{_}Didactic as well as descriptive, it was designed not merely to present realistic pictures but to arouse certain explicitly stated thoughts and feelings.
10161-8{_}224{_}Thomson had absorbed some of Shaftesbury's ideas.
10161-8{_}225{_}Such sketches as that of the hardships which country folk suffer in winter, contrasted with the thoughtless gayety of city revelers, and inculcating the lesson of sympathy, are precisely in the vein that sentimentalism encouraged.
10161-8{_}226{_}So, too, the tendency of Shaftesbury to deify Nature appears in several ardent passages.
10161-8{_}227{_}The choice of blank verse as the medium of this liberal and expansive train of thought was appropriate.
10161-8{_}228{_}It should not be supposed, however, that Thomson accepted sentimentalism in its entirety or fully understood its ultimate bearings.
10161-8{_}229{_}The author of _Rule, Britannia_ praised many things,--like commerce and industry and imperial power,--that are not favored by the thorough sentimentalist.
10161-8{_}230{_}Often he was inconsistent: his _Hymn to Nature_ is in part a pantheistic rhapsody, in part a monotheistic Hebrew psalm.
10161-8{_}231{_}Essentially an indolent though receptive mind, he made no effort to trace the new ideas to their consequences; he vaguely considered them not irreconcilable with the old.
10161-8{_}232{_}A keener mind fell into the same error.
10161-8{_}233{_}Pope, in the _Essay on Man_, tried to harmonize the orthodox conception of human character with sentimental optimism.
10161-8{_}234{_}As a collection of those memorable half-truths called aphorisms, the poem is admirable; as an attempt to unite new half-truths with old into a consistent scheme of life, it is fallacious.
10161-8{_}235{_}No creature composed of such warring elements as Pope describes in the superb antitheses that open Epistle II, can ever become in this world as good and at the same time as happy as Epistle IV vainly asserts.
10161-8{_}236{_}Pope, charged with heresy, did not repeat this endeavor to console mankind; he returned to his proper element, satire.
10161-8{_}237{_}But his effort to unite the new philosophy with the old psychology is striking evidence of the attractiveness and growing vogue of Shaftesbury's theories.
10161-8{_}238{_}It was minor poets who first expressed sentimental ideas without inconsistency.
10161-8{_}239{_}As early as 1732, anonymous lines in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ advanced what must have seemed the outrageously paradoxical thought that the savage in the wilderness was happier than civilized man.
10161-8{_}240{_}Two years later Soame Jenyns openly assailed in verse the orthodox doctrines of sin and retribution.
10161-8{_}241{_}These had long been assailed in prose; and under the influence of the attacks, within the pale of the Church itself, some ministers had suppressed or modified the sterner aspects of the creed,--a movement which Young's satires had ridiculed in the person of a lady of fashion who gladly entertained the notion that the Deity was too well-bred to call a lady to account for her offenses.
10161-8{_}242{_}Jenyns versified this effeminization of Christianity, charged orthodoxy with attributing cruelty to God, and asserted that faith in divine and human kindness would banish all wrong and discord from the world.
10161-8{_}243{_}In 1735 a far more important poet of sentimentalism arose in Henry Brooke, an undeservedly neglected pioneer, who, likewise drawing his inspiration from Shaftesbury, developed its theories with unusual consistency and fullness.
10161-8{_}244{_}His _Universal Beauty_ voiced his sense of the divine immanence in every part of the cosmos, and emphasized the doctrine that animals, because they unhesitatingly follow the promptings of Nature, are more lovely, happy, and moral than Man, who should learn from them the individual and social virtues, abandon artificial civilization, and follow instinct.
10161-8{_}245{_}Brooke, in the prologue of his _Gustavus Vasa_, shows that he foresaw the political bearings of this theory; it is, in his opinion, peculiarly a people "guiltless of courts, untainted, and unread" that, illumined by Nature, understands and upholds freedom: but this was a thought too advanced to be general at this time even among Brooke's fellow-sentimentalists.
10161-8{_}246{_}Though sentimental literature bore the seeds of revolution, its earliest effect upon its devotees was to create, through flattery of human character, a feeling of good-natured complacency.
10161-8{_}247{_}Against this optimism the traditional school reacted in two ways,--derisive and hortatory.
10161-8{_}248{_}Pope, Young, and Swift satirized with masterful skill the inherent weaknesses and follies of mankind, the vigor of their strokes drawing from the sentimentalist Whitehead the feeble but significant protest, _On Ridicule_, deprecating satire as discouraging to benevolence.
10161-8{_}249{_}On the other hand, Wesley's hymns fervently summoned to repentance and piety; while Young's _Night Thoughts_, yielding to the new influence only in its form (blank verse), reasserted the hollowness of earthly existence, the justice of God's stern will, and the need of faith in heavenly immortality as the only adequate satisfaction of the spiritual elements in Man.
10161-8{_}250{_}The literary powers of Pope, Swift, and Young were far superior to those of the opposed school, which might have been overborne had not a second generation of sentimentalists arisen to voice its claims in a more poetical manner.
10161-8{_}251{_}These newcomers,--Akenside, J.G.
10161-8{_}252{_}Cooper, the Wartons, and Collins,--all of them very young, appeared between 1744 and 1747; and each rendered distinct service to their common cause.
10161-8{_}253{_}The least original of the group, John Gilbert Cooper, versified in _The Power of Harmony_ Shaftesbury's cosmogony.
10161-8{_}254{_}More independently, Mark Akenside developed out of the same doctrine of universal harmony the theory of aesthetics that was to guide the school,--the theory that the true poet is created not by culture and discipline at all, but owes to the impress of Nature--that beauty which is goodness--his imagination, his taste, and his moral vision.
10161-8{_}255{_}Though comparatively ardent and free in manner, Akenside pursued the customary, didactic method.
10161-8{_}256{_}Less abstract, more nearly an utterance of personal feeling, was Joseph Warton's _Enthusiast, or the Lover of Nature_, historically a remarkable poem, which, through its expression of the author's tastes and preferences, indicated briefly some of the most important touchstones of the sentimentalism (_videlicet_, "romanticism") of the future.
10161-8{_}257{_}Warton found odious such things as artificial gardens, commercial interests, social and legal conventions, and a formal Addisonian style; he yearned for mountainous wilds, unspoiled savages, solitudes where the voice of Wisdom was heard above the storms, and poetry that was "wildly warbled."
10161-8{_}258{_}His younger brother Thomas, who wrote _The Pleasures of Melancholy_, and sonnets showing an interest in non-classical antiquities, likewise felt the need of new literary gods to sanction the practices of their school: Pope and Dryden were accordingly dethroned; Spenser, Shakespeare, and the young Milton, all of whom were believed to warble wildly, were invoked.
10161-8{_}259{_}William Collins was the most gifted of this band of enthusiasts.
10161-8{_}260{_}His general views were theirs: poetry is in his mind associated with wonder and ecstacy; and it finds its true themes, as the _Ode on Popular Superstitions_ shows, in the weird legends, the pathetic mischances, and the blameless manners of a simple-minded folk remote from cities.
10161-8{_}261{_}Unlike his fellows, Collins had moments of great lyric power, and gave posterity a few treasured poems.
10161-8{_}262{_}His further distinction is that he desired really to create that poetical world about which Akenside theorized and for which the Wartons yearned.
10161-8{_}263{_}Unhappily, however, he too often peopled it with allegorical figures who move in a hazy atmosphere; and his melody is then more apparent than his meaning.
10161-8{_}264{_}The hopeful spirit of these enthusiasts found little encouragement in the poems with which the period closed,--Gray's _Ode on Eton_ and _Hymn to Adversity_, and Johnson's _Vanity of Human Wishes_.
10161-8{_}265{_}Some bold adventurers disdain   The limits of their little reign,  wrote Gray, adding with the wisdom of disillusion,    Gay hopes are theirs, by fancy fed,   Less pleasing when possessed.
10161-8{_}266{_}He was speaking of schoolboys whose ignorance is bliss; but the general tenor of his mind allows us to surmise that he also smiled pityingly upon some of the aspirations of the youthful sentimentalists.
10161-8{_}267{_}Dr. Johnson's hostility to them was, of course, outspoken.
10161-8{_}268{_}He laughed uproariously at their ecstatic manner, and ridiculed the cant of sensibility; and in solemn mood he struck in _The Vanity of Human Wishes_ another blow at the heresy of optimism.
10161-8{_}269{_}In style the contrast between these poems and those of the Wartons and Collins is marked.
10161-8{_}270{_}Heirs of the Augustans, Johnson and Gray have perfect control over their respective diction and metres: here are no obscurities or false notes; Johnson sustains with superb dignity the tone of moral grandeur; Gray is ever felicitous.
10161-8{_}271{_}Up to the mid-century then, despite assailants, the classical school held its supremacy; for its literary art was incomparably more skillful than that of its enemies.
10161-8{_}272{_}III.
10161-8{_}273{_}THE PROGRESS OF SENTIMENTALISM  (1751-1775)  During the 1750's sentimental poetry did not fulfill the expectations which the outburst of 1744 had seemed to promise.
10161-8{_}274{_}It sank to lower levels, and its productions are noteworthy only as signs of the times and presages of the future.
10161-8{_}275{_}Richard Jago wrote some bald verses intended to foster opposition to hunting, and love for the lower animals,--according to the sentimental view really the "little brothers" of Man.
10161-8{_}276{_}John Dalton's crude _Descriptive Poem_ apostrophized what was regarded as the "savage grandeur" of the Lake country; it is interesting only because it mentions Keswick, Borrowdale, Lodore, and Skiddaw, half a century later to become sacred ground.
10161-8{_}277{_}The practical dilemma of the sentimentalist,--drawn toward solitude by his worship of Nature, and toward society by his love for Man,--was described by Whitehead in _The Enthusiast_, the humanitarian impulse being finally given the preference.
10161-8{_}278{_}Though the last of these pieces is not contemptible in style, none of these writers had sufficient ardor to compel attention; and if sentimentalism had not been steadily disseminated through other literary forms, especially the novel, it might well have been regarded as a lost cause.
10161-8{_}279{_}The great poet of this decade was Gray, whose _Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard_, by many held the noblest English lyric, appeared in 1751.
10161-8{_}280{_}His classical ideal of style, according to which poetry should have, in his words, "extreme conciseness of expression," yet be "pure, perspicuous, and musical," was realized both in the _Elegy_ and in the otherwise very different _Pindaric Odes_.
10161-8{_}281{_}The ethical and religious implications of the _Elegy_, its piety, its sense of the frailties as well as the merits of mankind, are conservative.
10161-8{_}282{_}Nor is there in the _Pindaric Odes_ any violation of classical principles.
10161-8{_}283{_}Gray never deviates into a pantheistic faith, a belief in human perfection, a conception of poetry as instinctive imagination unrestrained, or any other essential tenet of sentimentalism.
10161-8{_}284{_}Yet the influence of the new spirit upon him may be discerned.
10161-8{_}285{_}It modified his choice of subjects, and slightly colored their interpretation, without causing him to abandon the classical attitude.
10161-8{_}286{_}The _Elegy_ treats with reverence what the Augustans had neglected,--the tragic dignity of obscure lives; _The Progress of Poesy_ emphasizes qualities (emotion and sublimity) which the _Essay on Criticism_ had not stressed; and _The Bard_ presents a wildly picturesque figure of ancient days.
10161-8{_}287{_}Gray felt that classicism might quicken its spirit and widen its interests without surrendering its principles, that a classical poem might be a popular poem; and the admiration of posterity supports his belief.
10161-8{_}288{_}An astounding and epochal event was the publication (1760 ff.)
10161-8{_}289{_}of the poems attributed to Ossian.
10161-8{_}290{_}Their "editor and translator," James Macpherson, author of a forgotten sentimental epic, alleged that Ossian was a Gaelic poet of the third century A.D., who sang the loves and wars of the heroes of his people, brave warriors fighting the imperial legions of Rome; and that his poems had been orally transmitted until now, fifteen centuries later, they had been taken down from the lips of Scotch peasants.
10161-8{_}291{_}It was a fabrication as ingenious as brazen.
10161-8{_}292{_}As a matter of fact, Macpherson had found only an insignificant portion of his extensive work in popular ballads; and what little he had found he had expanded and changed out of all semblance to genuine ancient legend.
10161-8{_}293{_}Both the guiding motive of his prose-poem (it is his as truly as _King Lear_ is Shakespeare's), and the furore of welcome which greeted it, may be understood by recalling the position of the sentimental school on the eve of its appearance.
10161-8{_}294{_}The sentimentalists were maintaining that civilization had corrupted tastes, morals, and poetry, that it had perverted Man from his instinctive goodness, and that only by a return to communion with Nature could humanity and poetry be redeemed.
10161-8{_}295{_}But all this was based merely on philosophic theory, and could find no confirmation in history or literature: history knew of no innocent savages; and even as unsophisticated literature as Homer was then supposed to be, disclosed no heroes perfect in the sentimental virtues.
10161-8{_}296{_}_Ossian_ appeared; and the truth of sentimentalism seemed historically established.
10161-8{_}297{_}For here was poetry of the loftiest tone, composed in the unlearned Dark Ages, and answering the highest expectations concerning poetry inspired by Nature only.
10161-8{_}298{_}(Was not a distinguished Professor of Rhetoric saying, "Ossian's poetry, more perhaps than that of any other writer, deserves to be styled the poetry of the heart"?)
10161-8{_}299{_}And here was the record of a nature-people whose conduct stood revealed as flawless.
10161-8{_}300{_}"Fingal," Macpherson himself accommodatingly pointed out, "exercised every manly virtue in Caledonia while Heliogabalus disgraced human nature in Rome."
10161-8{_}301{_}More than fifty years afterwards Byron compared Homer's Hector, greatly to his disadvantage, with Ossian's Fingal: the latter's conduct was, in his admirer's words, "uniformly illustrious and great, without one mean or inhuman action to tarnish the splendor of his fame."
10161-8{_}302{_}The benevolent magnanimity of the heroes, the sweet sensibility of the heroines, their harmony with Nature's moods (traits which Macpherson had supplied from his own imagination), were the very traits that won the enthusiasm of the public.
10161-8{_}303{_}The poem in its turn stimulated the sentimentalism which had produced it; and henceforth the new school contended on even terms with the old.
10161-8{_}304{_}One of the effects of the progress of sentimentalism was the decline of satire.
10161-8{_}305{_}Peculiarly the weapon of the classical school, it had fallen into unskillful hands: Churchill, though keen and bold, lacked the grace of Pope and the power of Johnson.
10161-8{_}306{_}Goldsmith might have proved a worthier successor; but though his genius for style was large, his capacity for sustained indignation was limited.
10161-8{_}307{_}Even his _Retaliation_ is humorous in spirit rather than satiric.
10161-8{_}308{_}He was a being of conflicting impulses; and in his case at least, the style is not precisely the man.
10161-8{_}309{_}His temperament was emotional and affectionate; by nature he was a sentimentalist.
10161-8{_}310{_}But his inclinations were restrained, partly by the personal influence of Dr. Johnson, partly by his own admiration for the artistic traditions of the classicists.
10161-8{_}311{_}He despised looseness of style, considered blank verse unfinished, and cultivated what seemed to him the more polished elegance of the heroic couplet.
10161-8{_}312{_}The vacillation of his views appears in the difference between the sentiments of _The Traveller_ and those of _The Deserted Village_.
10161-8{_}313{_}The former is a survey of the nations of Europe, the object being to discover a people wholly admirable.
10161-8{_}314{_}Merit is found in Italians, Swiss, French, Dutch, and English,--but never perfection; even the free and happy Swiss are disgusting in the vulgar sensuality of their pleasures; happiness is nowhere.
10161-8{_}315{_}One is not surprised to learn that Dr. Johnson contributed at least a few lines to a poem with so orthodox a message.
10161-8{_}316{_}In _The Deserted Village_, on the other hand, Goldsmith employed the classical graces to point a moral which from the classical point of view was false.
10161-8{_}317{_}His sympathetic feelings had now been captivated by the notion of rural innocence.
10161-8{_}318{_}The traits of character which he attributed to the village inhabitants,--notably to the immortal preacher who, entertaining the vagrants,    Quite forgot their vices in their woe,--  are those exalted in the literature of sentimentalism, as, for example, in his contemporary, Langhorne's _Country Justice_.
10161-8{_}319{_}_The Deserted Village_ was in point of fact an imaginative idyll,--the supreme idyll of English poetry; but Goldsmith insisted that it was a realistic record of actual conditions.
10161-8{_}320{_}Yet he could never have observed such an English village, either in its depopulated and decayed state (as Macaulay has remarked), or in its rosy prosperity and unsullied virtue; his economic history and theory were misleading.
10161-8{_}321{_}Like Macpherson, but through self-delusion rather than intent, he was engaged in an effort to deceive by giving sentimental doctrines a basis of apparent actuality.
10161-8{_}322{_}But the world has forgotten or forgiven his pious fraud in its gratitude for the loveliness of his art.
10161-8{_}323{_}IV.
10161-8{_}324{_}THE TRIUMPH OF SENTIMENTALISM (1776-1800)  Goldsmith's application of sentimental ideas to contemporary affairs foreshadowed what was to be one of the marked tendencies of the movement in the last quarter of the century.
10161-8{_}325{_}Thus in 1777 Thomas Day interpreted the American Revolution as a conflict between the pitiless tyranny of a corrupt civilization and the appealing virtues of a people who had found in sequestered forests and prairies the abiding place of Freedom and the only remaining opportunity "to save the ruins of the human name."
10161-8{_}326{_}At the same time the justification of sentimentalism on historical grounds was strengthened by the young antiquarian and poet, Thomas Chatterton.
10161-8{_}327{_}Like Macpherson, he answers to Pope's description of archaizing authors,--    Ancients in words, mere moderns in their sense.
10161-8{_}328{_}He fabricated, in what he thought to be Middle English, a body of songs and interludes, which he attributed to a monk named Thomas Rowleie, and which showed that, in the supposedly unsophisticated simplicity of medieval times, charity to Man and love for Nature had flourished as beautifully as lyric utterance.
10161-8{_}329{_}Even more lamentable than Chatterton's early death is the fact that his fanciful and musical genius was shrouded in so grotesque a style.
10161-8{_}330{_}In 1781 appeared a new poet of real distinction, George Crabbe, now the hope of the conservatives.
10161-8{_}331{_}Edmund Burke, who early in his great career had assailed the radicals in his ironic _Vindication of Natural Society_, and who to the end of his life contended against them in the arena of politics, on reading some of Crabbe's manuscripts, rescued this cultured and ingenuous man from obscurity and distress; and Dr. Johnson presently aided him in his literary labors.
10161-8{_}332{_}In _The Library_ Crabbe expressed the reverence of a scholarly soul for the garnered wisdom of the past, and satirized some of the popular writings of the day, including sentimental fiction.
10161-8{_}333{_}He would not have denied the world those consolations which flow from the literature that mirrors our hopes and dreams; but his honest spirit revolted when such literature professed to be true to life.
10161-8{_}334{_}His acquaintance with actual conditions in humble circles, and with hardships, was as personal as Goldsmith's; but he was not the kind of poet who soothes the miseries of mankind by ignoring them.
10161-8{_}335{_}In _The Village_ he arose with all the vigor and intensity of insulted common sense to refute the dreamers who offered a rose-colored picture of country life as a genuine portrayal of truth and nature.
10161-8{_}336{_}So evident was his mastery of his subject, his clearness of perception, and his earnestness of feeling, that he attracted immediate attention; and he might well have led a new advance under the ancient standards.
10161-8{_}337{_}But silence fell upon Crabbe for many years; and this proved, to be the last occasion in the poetical history of the century that a powerful voice was raised in behalf of the old cause.
10161-8{_}338{_}The poet who became the favorite of moderate sentimentalists, in what were called "genteel" circles, was William Cowper.
10161-8{_}339{_}He presented little or nothing that could affright the gentle emotions, and much that pleasurably stimulated them.
10161-8{_}340{_}He enriched the poetry of the domestic affections, and had a vein of sadness which occasionally, as in _To Mary_, deepened into the most touching pathos.
10161-8{_}341{_}In _The Task_, a discursive familiar essay in smooth-flowing blank verse, he dwelt fondly upon those satisfactions which his life of uneventful retirement offered; intimated that truth and wisdom were less surely found by poring upon books than by meditating among beloved rural scenes; and, turning his sad gaze toward the distant world of action, deplored that mankind strained "the natural bond of brotherhood" by tolerating cruel imprisonments, slavery, and warfare.
10161-8{_}342{_}Such humanitarian views, when they seek the aid of religious ethics, ought normally to find support in that sentimentalized Christianity which professes the entire goodness of the human heart; but the discordant element in Cowper's mind was his inclination towards Calvinism, which goes to the opposite extreme by insisting on total depravity.
10161-8{_}343{_}Personally he believed that he had committed the unpardonable sin (against the Holy Spirit),--a dreadful thought which underlies his tragic poem, _The Castaway_; and probably unwholesome, though well-intentioned, was the influence upon him of his spiritual adviser, John Newton, whose gloomy theology may be seen in the hymn, _The Vision of Life in Death_.
10161-8{_}344{_}Cowper's sense of the reality of evil not only distracted his mind to madness, but also prevented him from carrying his sentimental principles to their logical goal.
10161-8{_}345{_}What the hour demanded were poets who, discountenancing any mistrust of the natural emotions, should give them free rein.
10161-8{_}346{_}They were found at last in Burns and in Blake.
10161-8{_}347{_}The sentimentalists had long yearned for the advent of the ideal poet.
10161-8{_}348{_}Macpherson had presented him,--but as of an era far remote; latterly Beattie, in _The Minstrel_, had set forth his growth under the inspiration of Nature,--but in a purely imaginary tale.
10161-8{_}349{_}Suddenly Burns appeared: and the ideal seemed incarnated in the living present.
10161-8{_}350{_}The Scottish bard was introduced to the world by his first admirers as "a heaven-taught ploughman, of humble unlettered station," whose "simple strains, artless and unadorned, seem to flow without effort from the native feelings of the heart"; and as "a signal instance of true and uncultivated genius."
10161-8{_}351{_}The real Burns, though indeed a genius of song, was far better read than the expectant world wished to believe, particularly in those whom he called his "bosom favorites," the sentimentalists Mackenzie and Sterne; and his sense of rhythm and melody had been trained by his emulation of earlier Scotch lyricists, whose lilting cadences flow towards him as highland rills to the gathering torrent.
10161-8{_}352{_}Sung to the notes of his native tunes, and infused with the local color of Scotch life, the sentimental themes assumed the freshness of novelty.
10161-8{_}353{_}Giving a new ardor to revolutionary tendencies,--Burns revolted against the orthodoxy of the "Auld Lichts," depicting its representatives as ludicrously hypocritical.
10161-8{_}354{_}He protested against distinctions founded on birth or rank, as in _A Man's a Man for A' That_; and, on the other hand, he idealized the homely feelings and manners of the "virtuous populace" in his immortal _Cotter's Saturday Night_.
10161-8{_}355{_}He scorned academic learning, and protested that true inspiration was rather to be found in "ae spark o' Nature's fire,"--or at the nearest tavern:    Leese me on drink!
10161-8{_}356{_}It gies us mair   Than either school or college.
10161-8{_}357{_}Like Sterne, who boasted that his pen governed him, Burns praised and affected the impromptu:    But how the subject theme may gang,   Let time or chance determine;   Perhaps it may turn out a sang,   Perhaps turn out a sermon.
10161-8{_}358{_}His Muse was to be the mood of the moment.
10161-8{_}359{_}Herein he brought to fulfillment the sentimental desire for the liberation of the emotions; but his work, taken as a whole, can scarcely be said to vindicate the faith that the emotions, once freed, would manifest instinctive purity.
10161-8{_}360{_}At his almost unrivalled best, he can sing in the sweetest strains the raptures or pathos of innocent youthful love, as in _Sweet Afton_ or _To Mary in Heaven_; but straightway sinking from that elevation of feeling to the depths of vulgarity or grossness, he will chant with equal zest and skill the indulgence of the animal appetites.
10161-8{_}361{_}[1] He hails the joys of life, but without discriminating between the higher and the lower.
10161-8{_}362{_}Yet these exuberant animal spirits which, unrestrained by conscience or taste, drove him too often into scurrility, gave his work that passion--warm, throbbing, and personal--which had been painfully wanting in earlier poets of sensibility.
10161-8{_}363{_}It was his emotional intensity as well as his lyric genius that made him the most popular poet of his time.
10161-8{_}364{_}In Burns, sentimentalism was largely temperamental, unreflective, and concrete.
10161-8{_}365{_}In William Blake, the singularity of whose work long retarded its due appreciation, sentimentalism was likewise temperamental; but, unconfined to actuality, became far broader in scope, more spiritual, and more consistently philosophic.
10161-8{_}366{_}Indeed, Blake was the ultimate sentimentalist of the century.
10161-8{_}367{_}A visionary and symbolist, he passed beyond Shaftesbury in his thought, and beyond any poet of the school in his endeavor to create a new and appropriate style.
10161-8{_}368{_}His contemporary, Erasmus Darwin, author of _The Botanic Garden_, was trying to give sentimentalism a novel interpretation by describing the life of plants in terms of human life; but, Darwin being destitute of artistic sense, the result was grotesque.
10161-8{_}369{_}Blake, by training and vocation an engraver, was primarily an artist; but, partly under Swedenborgian influences, he had grasped the innermost character of sentimentalism, perceived all its implications, and carried them fearlessly to their utmost bounds.
10161-8{_}370{_}To him every atom of the cosmos was literally spiritual and holy; the divine and the human, the soul and the flesh, were absolutely one; God and Man were only two aspects of pervasive "mercy, pity, peace, and love."
10161-8{_}371{_}Nothing else had genuine reality.
10161-8{_}372{_}The child, its vision being as yet unclouded by false teachings, saw the universe thus truly; and Blake, therefore, in _Songs of Innocence_, gave glimpses of the world as the child sees it,--a guileless existence amid the peace that passes all understanding.
10161-8{_}373{_}He hymned the sanctity of animal life: even the tiger, conventionally an incarnation of cruelty, was a glorious creature of divine mould; to slay or cage a beast was, the _Auguries of Innocence_ protested, to incur anathema.
10161-8{_}374{_}The _Book of Thel_ allegorically showed the mutual interdependence of all creation, and reprehended the maiden shyness that shrinks from merging its life in the sacrificial union which sustains the whole.
10161-8{_}375{_}To Blake the great enemy of truth was the cold logical reason, a truncated part of Man's spirit, which was incapable of attaining wisdom, and which had fabricated those false notions that governed the practical world and constrained the natural feelings.
10161-8{_}376{_}Instances of the unhappiness caused by such constraint, he gave in _Songs of Experience_, where _The Garden of Love_ describes the blighting curse which church law had laid upon free love.
10161-8{_}377{_}To overthrow intellectualism and discipline, Man must liberate his most precious faculty, the imagination, which alone can reveal the spiritual character of the universe and the beauty that life will wear when the feelings cease to be unnaturally confined.
10161-8{_}378{_}Temporarily Blake rejoiced when the French Revolution seemed to usher in the millennium of freedom and peace; and his interpretation of its earlier incidents in his poem on that theme[2] illustrates in style and spirit the highly original nature of his mind.
10161-8{_}379{_}More than any predecessor he understood how the peculiarly poetical possibilities of sentimentalism might be elicited, namely by emphasizing its mystical quality.
10161-8{_}380{_}Thus under his guidance mysticism, which in the early seventeenth century had sublimated the religious poetry of the orthodox, returned to sublimate the poetry of the radicals; and with that achievement the sentimental movement reached its climax.
10161-8{_}381{_}Burns died in 1796; Blake, lost in a realm of symbolism, became unintelligible; and temporarily sentimentalism suffered a reaction.
10161-8{_}382{_}The French Revolution, with its Reign of Terror, and the rise of a military autocrat, though supported, even after Great Britain had taken up arms against Napoleon, by some "friends of humanity" who placed universal brotherhood above patriotism, seemed to the general public to demonstrate that the sentimental theories and hopes were untrue to life and led to results directly contrary to those predicted.
10161-8{_}383{_}Once again, in Canning's caustic satires of _The Anti-Jacobin_, conservatism raised its voice.
10161-8{_}384{_}But by this time sentimentalism was too fully developed and widely spread to be more than checked.
10161-8{_}385{_}Under the new leadership of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, the movement, chastened and modified by experience, resumed its progress; and the fame of its new leaders presently dimmed the memory of those pioneers who in the eighteenth century had undermined the foundations of orthodoxy, slowly upbuilt a new world of thought, gradually fashioned a poetic style more suited to their sentiments than the classical, and thus helped to plunge the modern world into that struggle which, in life and in literature, rages about us still.

10161-8{_}389{_}THE GENTLEMAN'S RETIREMENT    Near some fair town I'd have a private seat,   Built uniform, not little, nor too great:   Better, if on a rising ground it stood;   Fields on this side, on that a neighbouring wood.
10161-8{_}390{_}It should within no other things contain,   But what are useful, necessary, plain:   Methinks 'tis nauseous, and I'd ne'er endure,   The needless pomp of gaudy furniture.
10161-8{_}391{_}A little garden, grateful to the eye;   And a cool rivulet run murmuring by,   On whose delicious banks a stately row   Of shady limes, or sycamores, should grow.
10161-8{_}392{_}At th' end of which a silent study placed,   Should with the noblest authors there be graced:   Horace and Virgil, in whose mighty lines   Immortal wit, and solid learning, shines;   Sharp Juvenal and amorous Ovid too,   Who all the turns of love's soft passion knew:   He that with judgment reads the charming lines,   In which strong art with stronger nature joins,   Must grant his fancy does the best excel;   His thoughts so tender, and expressed so well:   With all those moderns, men of steady sense,   Esteemed for learning, and for eloquence.
10161-8{_}393{_}In some of these, as fancy should advise,   I'd always take my morning exercise:   For sure no minutes bring us more content,   Than those in pleasing useful studies spent.
10161-8{_}394{_}II.
10161-8{_}395{_}HIS FORTUNE AND CHARITY    I'd have a clear and competent estate,   That I might live genteelly, but not great:   As much as I could moderately spend;   A little more, sometimes t' oblige a friend.
10161-8{_}396{_}Nor should the sons of poverty repine   At fortune's frown, for they should taste of mine;   And all that objects of true pity were,   Should be relieved with what my wants could spare;   For what our Maker has too largely given,   Should be returned in gratitude to Heaven.
10161-8{_}397{_}A frugal plenty should my table spread.
10161-8{_}398{_}With healthy, not luxurious, dishes fed;   Enough to satisfy, and something more,   To feed the stranger, and the neighb'ring poor.
10161-8{_}399{_}Strong meat indulges vice, and pampering food   Creates diseases, and inflames the blood.
10161-8{_}400{_}But what's sufficient to make nature strong,   And the bright lamp of life continue long,   I'd freely take, and as I did possess,   The bounteous Author of my plenty bless.
10161-8{_}401{_}III.
10161-8{_}402{_}HIS HOSPITALITY AND TEMPERANCE    I'd have a little cellar, cool and neat,   With humming ale and virgin wine replete.
10161-8{_}403{_}Wine whets the wit, improves its native force,   And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse;   By making all our spirits debonair,   Throws off the lees and sediment of care.
10161-8{_}404{_}But as the greatest blessing Heaven lends   May be debauched, and serve ignoble ends;   So, but too oft, the grape's refreshing juice   Does many mischievous effects produce.
10161-8{_}405{_}My house should no such rude disorders know,   As from high drinking consequently flow;   Nor would I use what was so kindly given,   To the dishonour of indulgent Heaven.
10161-8{_}406{_}If any neighbour came, he should be free,   Used with respect, and not uneasy be,   In my retreat, or to himself or me.
10161-8{_}407{_}What freedom, prudence, and right reason give,   All men may, with impunity, receive:   But the least swerving from their rules too much,   And what's forbidden us, 'tis death to touch.
10161-8{_}408{_}IV.
10161-8{_}409{_}HIS COMPANY    That life may be more comfortable yet,   And all my joys refined, sincere, and great;   I'd choose two friends, whose company would be   A great advance to my felicity:   Well-born, of humours suited to my own,   Discreet, that men as well as books have known;   Brave, generous, witty, and exactly free   From loose behaviour or formality;   Airy and prudent, merry but not light;   Quick in discerning; and in judging, right;   They should be secret, faithful to their trust,   In reasoning cool, strong, temperate, and just;   Obliging, open, without huffing, brave;   Brisk in gay talking, and in sober, grave;   Close in dispute, but not tenacious; tried   By solemn reason, and let that decide;   Not prone to lust, revenge, or envious hate;   Nor busy meddlers with intrigues of state;   Strangers to slander, and sworn foes to spite,   Not quarrelsome, but stout enough to fight;   Loyal and pious, friends to Caesar; true   As dying martyrs to their Makers too.
10161-8{_}410{_}In their society I could not miss   A permanent, sincere, substantial bliss.
10161-8{_}411{_}V. HIS LADY AND CONVERSE    Would bounteous Heaven once more indulge, I'd choose   (For who would so much satisfaction lose   As witty nymphs in conversation give?)
10161-8{_}412{_}Near some obliging modest fair to live:   For there's that sweetness in a female mind,   Which in a man's we cannot [hope to] find;   That, by a secret but a powerful art,   Winds up the spring of life, and does impart   Fresh, vital heat to the transported heart.
10161-8{_}413{_}I'd have her reason all her passions sway;   Easy in company, in private gay;   Coy to a fop, to the deserving free;   Still constant to herself, and just to me.
10161-8{_}414{_}She should a soul have for great actions fit;   Prudence and wisdom to direct her wit;   Courage to look bold danger in the face,   Not fear, but only to be proud or base;   Quick to advise, by an emergence pressed,   To give good counsel, or to take the best.
10161-8{_}415{_}I'd have th' expressions of her thoughts be such,   She might not seem reserved, nor talk too much:   That shows a want of judgment and of sense;   More than enough is but impertinence.
10161-8{_}416{_}Her conduct regular, her mirth refined;   Civil to strangers, to her neighbours kind;   Averse to vanity, revenge, and pride;   In all the methods of deceit untried;   So faithful to her friend, and good to all,   No censure might upon her actions fall:   Then would e'en envy be compelled to say   She goes the least of womankind astray.
10161-8{_}417{_}To this fair creature I'd sometimes retire;   Her conversation would new joys inspire;   Give life an edge so keen, no surly care   Would venture to assault my soul, or dare   Near my retreat to hide one secret snare.
10161-8{_}418{_}But so divine, so noble a repast   I'd seldom, and with moderation, taste:   For highest cordials all their virtue lose,   By a too frequent and too bold an use;   And what would cheer the spirits in distress,   Ruins our health when taken to excess.
10161-8{_}419{_}VI.
10161-8{_}420{_}HIS PEACEABLE LIFE    I'd be concerned in no litigious jar;   Beloved by all, not vainly popular.
10161-8{_}421{_}Whate'er assistance I had power to bring   T' oblige my company, or to serve my king,   Whene'er they called, I'd readily afford,   My tongue, my pen, my counsel, or my sword.
10161-8{_}422{_}Lawsuits I'd shun, with as much studious care,   As I would dens where hungry lions are;   And rather put up injuries, than be   A plague to him who'd be a plague to me.
10161-8{_}423{_}I value quiet at a price too great   To give for my revenge so dear a rate:   For what do we by all our bustle gain,   But counterfeit delight for real pain?
10161-8{_}424{_}VII.
10161-8{_}425{_}HIS HAPPY DEATH    If Heaven a date of many years would give,   Thus I'd in pleasure, ease, and plenty live.
10161-8{_}426{_}And as I near approach[ed] the verge of life,   Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)   Should take upon him all my worldly care   While I did for a better state prepare.
10161-8{_}427{_}Then I'd not be with any trouble vexed,   Nor have the evening of my days perplexed;   But by a silent and a peaceful death,   Without a sigh, resign my aged breath.
10161-8{_}428{_}And, when committed to the dust, I'd have   Few tears, but friendly, dropped into my grave;   Then would my exit so propitious be,   All men would wish to live and die like me.

10161-8{_}450{_}Contempt, that false new word for shame,   Is, without crime, an empty name,   A shadow to amuse mankind,   But never frights the wise or well-fixed mind:   Virtue despises human scorn,   And scandals innocence adorn.

10161-8{_}464{_}Death, in approaching terrible, imparts   An anxious horror to the bravest hearts;   Yet do their beating breasts demand the strife,   And thirst of glory quells the love of life.
10161-8{_}465{_}No vulgar fears can British minds control:   Heat of revenge and noble pride of soul   O'er look the foe, advantaged by his post,   Lessen his numbers, and contract his host;   Though fens and floods possessed the middle space,   That unprovoked they would have feared to pass,   Nor fens nor floods can stop Britannia's bands   When her proud foe ranged on their borders stands.
10161-8{_}466{_}But, O my Muse, what numbers wilt thou find   To sing the furious troops in battle joined!
10161-8{_}467{_}Methinks I hear the drum's tumultuous sound   The victor's shouts and dying groans confound,   The dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies,   And all the thunder of the battle rise!
10161-8{_}468{_}'Twas then great Malborough's mighty soul was proved,   That, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,   Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,   Examined all the dreadful scenes of death surveyed,   To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,   Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,   And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.
10161-8{_}469{_}So when an angel by divine command   With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,   Such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed,   Calm and serene he drives the furious blast,   And, pleases th' Almighty's orders to perform,   Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.

10161-8{_}476{_}My pen amongst the rest I took,   Lest those bright eyes that cannot read   Should dart their kindling fires, and look   The power they have to be obeyed.
10161-8{_}477{_}Nor quality nor reputation   Forbid me yet my flame to tell;   Dear five years old befriends my passion,   And I may write till she can spell.

10161-8{_}479{_}Then, too, alas!
10161-8{_}480{_}when she shall tear   The lines some younger rival sends,   She'll give me leave to write, I fear,   And we shall still continue friends;    For, as our different ages move,   'Tis so ordained (would fate but mend it!)

10161-8{_}483{_}In the dispute whate'er I said,   My heart was by my tongue belied,   And in my looks you might have read   How much I argued on your side.
10161-8{_}484{_}You, far from danger as from fear,   Might have sustained an open fight:   For seldom your opinions err;   Your eyes are always in the right.
10161-8{_}485{_}Why, fair one, would you not rely   On reason's force with beauty's joined?
10161-8{_}486{_}Could I their prevalence deny,   I must at once be deaf and blind.
10161-8{_}487{_}Alas!
10161-8{_}488{_}not hoping to subdue,   I only to the fight aspired;   To keep the beauteous foe in view   Was all the glory I desired.

10161-8{_}508{_}Some with vast stocks, and little pains,   Jumped into business of great gains;   And some were damned to scythes and spades,   And all those hard laborious trades   Where willing wretches daily sweat   And wear out strength and limbs, to eat;   While others followed mysteries   To which few folks, bind prentices,   That want no stock but that of brass,   And may set up without a cross,--   As sharpers, parasites, pimps, players,   Pickpockets, coiners, quacks, soothsayers,   And all those that in enmity   With downright working, cunningly   Convert to their own use the labour   Of their good-natured heedless neighbour.
10161-8{_}509{_}These were called knaves; but bar the name,   The grave industrious were the same:   All trades and places knew some cheat,   No calling was without deceit.

10161-8{_}575{_}How could angels bear the sight?
10161-8{_}576{_}Was there nothing but a manger   Cursed sinners could afford   To receive the heavenly stranger?
10161-8{_}577{_}Did they thus affront their Lord?
10161-8{_}578{_}Soft, my child: I did not chide thee,   Though my song might sound too hard;   'Tis thy mother sits beside thee,   And her arms shall be thy guard.
10161-8{_}579{_}Yet to read the shameful story   How the Jews abused their King,   How they served the Lord of Glory,   Makes me angry while I sing.

10161-8{_}581{_}Where they sought Him, there they found Him,   With His virgin mother by.
10161-8{_}582{_}See the lovely babe a-dressing;   Lovely infant, how He smiled!
10161-8{_}583{_}When He wept, the mother's blessing   Soothed and hushed the holy child.
10161-8{_}584{_}Lo, He slumbers in His manger,   Where the hornèd oxen fed;   Peace, my darling: here's no danger,   Here's no ox a-near thy bed.
10161-8{_}585{_}'Twas to save thee, child, from dying.

10161-8{_}588{_}ALEXANDER POPE     FROM AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM    'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill   Appear in writing or in judging ill;   But, of the two, less dangerous is th' offense   To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
10161-8{_}589{_}Some few in that, but numbers err in this,   Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;   A fool might once himself alone expose,   Now one in verse makes many more in prose.
10161-8{_}590{_}'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none   Go just alike, yet each believes his own.
10161-8{_}591{_}In poets as true genius is but rare,   True taste as seldom is the critic's share;   Both must alike from heaven derive their light,   These born to judge, as well as those to write.
10161-8{_}592{_}Let such teach others who themselves excel,   And censure freely who have written well.
10161-8{_}593{_}Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,   But are not critics to their judgment too?
10161-8{_}594{_}*       *       *       *       *    But you who seek to give and merit fame   And justly bear a critic's noble name,   Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,   How far your genius, taste, and learning go;   Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,   And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.
10161-8{_}595{_}*       *       *       *       *    First follow Nature, and your judgment frame   By her just standard, which is still the same:   Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,   One clear, unchanged, and universal light,   Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,   At once the source, and end, and test of art.
10161-8{_}596{_}Art from that fund each just supply provides,   Works without show, and without pomp presides:   In some fair body thus th' informing soul   With spirit feeds, with vigour fills the whole.
10161-8{_}597{_}Each motion guides, and every nerve sustains;   Itself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.
10161-8{_}598{_}Some, to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse,   Want as much more, to turn it to its use;   For wit and judgment often are at strife,   Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife.
10161-8{_}599{_}'Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed;   Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;   The wingèd courser, like a generous horse,   Shows most true mettle when you check his course.
10161-8{_}600{_}Those rules of old discovered, not devised,   Are Nature still, but Nature methodized;   Nature, like liberty, is but restrained   By the same laws which first herself ordained.
10161-8{_}601{_}You, then, whose judgment the right course would steer,   Know well each ancient's proper character;   His fable, subject, scope in every page;   Religion, country, genius of his age:   Without all these at once before your eyes,   Cavil you may, but never criticise,   Be Homer's works your study and delight,   Read them by day, and meditate by night;   Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,   And trace the Muses upward to their spring.
10161-8{_}602{_}Still with itself compared, his text peruse;   And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.
10161-8{_}603{_}When first young Maro in his boundless mind   A work t' outlast immortal Rome designed,   Perhaps he seemed above the critic's law,   And but from nature's fountains scorned to draw:   But when t' examine every part he came,   Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.
10161-8{_}604{_}Convinced, amazed, he checks the bold design;   And rules as strict his laboured work confine   As if the Stagirite o'erlooked each line.
10161-8{_}605{_}Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;   To copy nature is to copy them.
10161-8{_}606{_}Some beauties yet no precepts can declare,   For there's a happiness as well as care.
10161-8{_}607{_}Music resembles poetry, in each   Are nameless graces which no methods teach,   And which a master-hand alone can reach.
10161-8{_}608{_}If, where the rules not far enough extend,   (Since rules were made but to promote their end)   Some lucky license answer to the full   Th' intent proposed, that license is a rule.
10161-8{_}609{_}Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,   May boldly deviate from the common track;   From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,   And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,   Which without passing through the judgment, gains   The heart, and all its end at once attains.
10161-8{_}610{_}In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,   Which out of nature's common order rise,   The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.
10161-8{_}611{_}Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,   And rise to faults true critics dare not mend.
10161-8{_}612{_}But tho' the ancients thus their rules invade,   (As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)   Moderns, beware!
10161-8{_}613{_}or if you must offend   Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end;   Let it be seldom and compelled by need;   And have, at least, their precedent to plead.
10161-8{_}614{_}The critic else proceeds without remorse,   Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.
10161-8{_}615{_}I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts   Those freer beauties, e'en in them, seem faults.
10161-8{_}616{_}Some figures monstrous and misshaped appear,   Considered singly, or beheld too near,   Which, but proportioned to their light or place,   Due distance reconciles to form and grace.
10161-8{_}617{_}A prudent chief not always must display   His powers in equal ranks, and fair array,   But with th' occasion and the place comply,   Conceal his force, nay, seem sometimes to fly.
10161-8{_}618{_}Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,   Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.
10161-8{_}619{_}*       *       *       *       *    A little learning is a dangerous thing;   Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:   There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,   And drinking largely sobers us again.
10161-8{_}620{_}Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,   In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,   While from the bounded level of our mind,   Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;   But more advanced, behold with strange surprise   New distant scenes of endless science rise!
10161-8{_}621{_}So pleased at first the towering Alps we try,   Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,   Th' eternal snows appear already past,   And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;   But, those attained, we tremble to survey   The growing labours of the lengthened way,   Th' increasing prospects tire our wandering eyes,   Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!
10161-8{_}622{_}A perfect judge will read each work of wit   With the same spirit that its author writ:   Survey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find   Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;   Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,   The gen'rous pleasure to be charmed with wit.
10161-8{_}623{_}But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,   Correctly cold, and regularly low,   That shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep;   We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.
10161-8{_}624{_}In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts   Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts:   'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,   But the joint force and full result of all.
10161-8{_}625{_}Thus when we view some well-proportioned dome,   (The world's just wonder, and e'en thine, O Rome!)
10161-8{_}626{_}So single parts unequally surprise,   All comes united to th' admiring eyes;   No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;   The whole at once is bold, and regular.
10161-8{_}627{_}Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,   Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.
10161-8{_}628{_}In every work regard the writer's end,   Since none can compass more than they intend;   And if the means be just, the conduct true,   Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due;   As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,   T' avoid great errors, must the less commit:   Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,   For not to know some trifles, is a praise.
10161-8{_}629{_}Most critics, fond of some subservient art,   Still make the whole depend upon a part:   They talk of principles, but notions prize,   And all to one loved folly sacrifice.
10161-8{_}630{_}Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,   A certain bard encountering on the way,   Discoursed in terms as just, with looks as sage,   As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage;   Concluding all were desperate sots and fools,   Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.
10161-8{_}631{_}Our author, happy in a judge so nice,   Produced his play, and begged the knight's advice;   Made him observe the subject, and the plot,   The manners, passions, unities, what not?
10161-8{_}632{_}All which, exact to rule, were brought about,   Were but a combat in the lists left out.
10161-8{_}633{_}'What!
10161-8{_}634{_}leave the combat out?'
10161-8{_}635{_}exclaims the knight;   Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.
10161-8{_}636{_}'Not so, by Heaven' (he answers in a rage),   'Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage.'
10161-8{_}637{_}So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.
10161-8{_}638{_}'Then build a new, or act it in a plain.'
10161-8{_}639{_}Thus critics, of less judgment than caprice,   Curious not knowing, not exact but nice,   Form short ideas; and offend in arts   (As most in manners) by a love to parts.
10161-8{_}640{_}Some to conceit alone their taste confine,   And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at every line;   Pleased with a work where nothing's just or fit;   One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.
10161-8{_}641{_}Poets like painters, thus unskilled to trace   The naked nature and the living grace,   With gold and jewels cover every part,   And hide with ornaments their want of art.
10161-8{_}642{_}True wit is nature to advantage dressed,   What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed;   Something, whose truth convinced at sight we find,   That gives us back the image of our mind.
10161-8{_}643{_}As shades more sweetly recommend the light,   So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.
10161-8{_}644{_}For works may have more wit than does 'em good,   As bodies perish through excess of blood.
10161-8{_}645{_}Others for language all their care express,   And value books, as women, men, for dress:   Their praise is still,--the style is excellent;   The sense, they humbly take upon content.
10161-8{_}646{_}Words are like leaves; and where they most abound,   Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.
10161-8{_}647{_}False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,   Its gaudy colours spreads on every place;   The face of nature we no more survey,   All glares alike, without distinction gay:   But true expression, like th' unchanging sun,   Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon,   It gilds all objects, but it alters none.
10161-8{_}648{_}Expression is the dress of thought, and still   Appears more decent, as more suitable;   A vile conceit in pompous words expressed,   Is like a clown in regal purple dressed:   For different styles with different subjects sort,   As several garbs with country, town, and court.
10161-8{_}649{_}Some by old words to fame have made pretence,   Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;   Such laboured nothings, in so strange a style,   Amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learnèd smile.
10161-8{_}650{_}Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,   These sparks with awkward vanity display   What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;   And but so mimic ancient wits at best,   As apes our grandsires, in their doublets dressed.
10161-8{_}651{_}In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;   Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:   Be not the first by whom the new are tried,   Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.
10161-8{_}652{_}But most by numbers judge a poet's song;   And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong:   In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire,   Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;   Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,   Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,   Not for the doctrine, but the music there.
10161-8{_}653{_}These equal syllables alone require,   Though oft the ear the open vowels tire;   While expletives their feeble aid do join,   And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:   While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,   With sure returns of still expected rhymes;   Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'   In the next line, it 'whispers through the trees;'   If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'   The reader's threatened (not in vain) with 'sleep':   Then, at the last and only couplet fraught   With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,   A needless Alexandrine ends the song,   That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.
10161-8{_}654{_}Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know   What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow;   And praise the easy vigour of a line,   Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.
10161-8{_}655{_}True ease in writing comes from art, not chance.
10161-8{_}656{_}As those move easiest who have learned to dance.
10161-8{_}657{_}'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,   The sound must seem an echo to the sense.
10161-8{_}658{_}Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,   And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;   But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,   The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.
10161-8{_}659{_}When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,   The line too labours, and the words move slow;   Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,   Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.
10161-8{_}660{_}Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,   And bid alternate passions fall and rise!
10161-8{_}661{_}While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove   Now burns with glory, and then melts with love;   Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,   Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:   Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,   And the world's victor stood subdued by sound!
10161-8{_}662{_}The power of music all our hearts allow,   And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.
10161-8{_}663{_}Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such,   Who still are pleased too little or too much.
10161-8{_}664{_}At every trifle scorn to take offence,   That always shows great pride, or little sense;   Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,   Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.
10161-8{_}665{_}Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move;   For fools admire, but men of sense approve:   As things seem large which we through mists descry,   Dulness is ever apt to magnify.
10161-8{_}666{_}Some foreign writers, some our own despise;   The ancients only, or the moderns prize.
10161-8{_}667{_}Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied   To one small sect, and all are damned beside.
10161-8{_}668{_}Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,   And force that sun but on a part to shine,   Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,   But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;   Which from the first has shone on ages past,   Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;   Though each may feel increases and decays,   And see now clearer and now darker days.
10161-8{_}669{_}Regard not, then, if wit be old or new,   But blame the false, and value still the true.
10161-8{_}670{_}Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own,   But catch the spreading notion of the town;   They reason and conclude by precedent,   And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.
10161-8{_}671{_}Some judge of author's names, not works, and then   Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.
10161-8{_}672{_}Of all this servile herd, the worst is he   That in proud dulness joins with Quality.

10161-8{_}679{_}Be silent always when you doubt your sense;   And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:   Some positive, persisting fops we know,   Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;   But you, with pleasure own your errors past,   And make each day a critic on the last.
10161-8{_}680{_}'Tis not enough, your counsel still be true;   Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;   Men must be taught as if you taught them not,   And things unknown proposed as things forgot.

10161-8{_}690{_}Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfined;   A knowledge both of books and human kind:   Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride;   And love to praise, with reason on his side?

10161-8{_}692{_}Fair nymphs, and well-dressed youths around her shone,   But every eye was fixed on her alone.
10161-8{_}693{_}On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,   Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.
10161-8{_}694{_}Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,   Quick as her eyes, and as unfixed as those;   Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;   Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
10161-8{_}695{_}Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,   And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.
10161-8{_}696{_}Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,   Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide;   If to her share some female errors fall,   Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.

10161-8{_}701{_}Resolved to win, he meditates the way,   By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;   For when success a lover's toil attends,   Few ask if fraud or force attained his ends.
10161-8{_}702{_}For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored   Propitious Heaven, and every power adored,   But chiefly Love; to Love an altar built,   Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.
10161-8{_}703{_}There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves,   And all the trophies of his former loves;   With tender billets-doux he lights the pyre,   And breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire.
10161-8{_}704{_}Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes   Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize.

10161-8{_}707{_}All but the sylph--with careful thoughts oppressed,   Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast.
10161-8{_}708{_}He summons straight his denizens of air;   The lucid squadrons around the sails repair;   Soft o'er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe,   That seemed but zephyrs to the train beneath.
10161-8{_}709{_}Some to the sun their insect wings unfold,   Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;   Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,   Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light.
10161-8{_}710{_}Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,   Thin glittering textures of the filmy dew,   Dipped in the richest tincture of the skies,   Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,   While every beam new transient colours flings,   Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.
10161-8{_}711{_}Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,   Superior by the head, was Ariel placed;   His purple pinions opening to the sun,   He raised his azure wand, and thus begun:    'Ye sylphs and sylphids, to your chief give ear!

10161-8{_}716{_}Some less refined, beneath the moon's pale light   Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,   Or suck the mists in grosser air below,   Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,   Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,   Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain;   Others on earth o'er human race preside,   Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:   Of these the chief the care of nations own,   And guard with arms divine the British throne.
10161-8{_}717{_}'Our humbler province is to tend the fair,   Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care;   To save the powder from too rude a gale,   Nor let th' imprisoned essences exhale;   To draw fresh colours from the vernal flowers;   To steal from rainbows, ere they drop in showers,   A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,   Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;   Nay, oft in dreams, invention we bestow,   To change a flounce, or add a furbelow.
10161-8{_}718{_}'This day, black omens threat the brightest fair   That e'er deserved a watchful spirit's care;   Some dire disaster, or by force, or sleight;   But what, or where, the fates have wrapped in night.
10161-8{_}719{_}Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,   Or some frail china jar receive a flaw;   Or stain her honour, or her new brocade;   Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;   Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;   Or whether Heaven has doomed that Shock must fall.
10161-8{_}720{_}Haste, then, ye spirits!
10161-8{_}721{_}to your charge repair;   The fluttering fan be Zephyretta's care;   The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;   And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;   Do thou, Crispissa, tend her favourite lock;   Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.
10161-8{_}722{_}To fifty chosen sylphs, of special note,   We trust th' important charge, the petticoat:   Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail,   Though stiff with hoops, and armed with ribs of whale;   Form a strong line about the silver bound,   And guard the wide circumference around.
10161-8{_}723{_}'Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,   His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,   Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,   Be stopped in vials, or transfixed with pins;   Or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,   Or wedged whole ages in a bodkin's eye;   Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,   While clogged he beats his silken wings in vain;   Or alum styptics with contracting power   Shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower;   Or, as Ixion fixed, the wretch shall feel   The giddy motion of the whirling mill,   In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,   And tremble at the sea that froths below!'
10161-8{_}724{_}He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;   Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;   Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;   Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;   With beating hearts the dire event they wait,   Anxious, and trembling for the birth of fate.
10161-8{_}725{_}CANTO III    Close by those meads, forever crowned with flowers,   Where Thames with pride surveys his rising towers,   There stands a structure of majestic frame,   Which from the neighbouring Hampton takes its name.
10161-8{_}726{_}Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom   Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home;   Here thou, great Anna!
10161-8{_}727{_}whom three realms obey,   Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.
10161-8{_}728{_}Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,   To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;   In various talk th' instructive hours they passed,   Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;   One speaks the glory of the British Queen,   And one describes a charming Indian screen;   A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;   At every word a reputation dies.
10161-8{_}729{_}Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,   With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.
10161-8{_}730{_}Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,   The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;   The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,   And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;   The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,   And the long labours of the toilet cease.
10161-8{_}731{_}Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,   Burns to encounter two adventurous knights,   At ombre singly to decide their doom;   And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.
10161-8{_}732{_}Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,   Each band the number of the sacred nine.
10161-8{_}733{_}Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aërial guard   Descend, and sit on each important card:   First, Ariel perched upon a Matadore,   Then each, according to the rank they bore;   For sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,   Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.
10161-8{_}734{_}Behold, four kings in majesty revered,   With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;   And four fair queens whose hands sustain a flower,   Th' expressive emblem of their softer power;   Four knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,   Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;   And parti-coloured troops, a shining train,   Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.
10161-8{_}735{_}The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:   Let spades be trumps!
10161-8{_}736{_}she said, and trumps they were.
10161-8{_}737{_}Now moved to war her sable Matadores,   In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.
10161-8{_}738{_}Spadillio first, unconquerable lord!
10161-8{_}739{_}Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.
10161-8{_}740{_}As many more Manillio forced to yield   And marched a victor from the verdant field.
10161-8{_}741{_}Him Basto followed, but his fate more hard   Gained but one trump and one plebeian card.
10161-8{_}742{_}With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,   The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,   Puts forth one manly leg, to sight revealed,   The rest, his many-coloured robe concealed.
10161-8{_}743{_}The rebel knave, who dares his prince engage,   Proves the just victim of his royal rage.
10161-8{_}744{_}Even mighty Pam, that kings and queens o'erthrew,   And mowed down armies in the fights of Loo,   Sad chance of war!
10161-8{_}745{_}now destitute of aid,   Falls undistinguished by the victor spade!
10161-8{_}746{_}Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;   Now to the baron fate inclines the field.
10161-8{_}747{_}His warlike Amazon her host invades,   The imperial consort of the crown of spades;   The club's black tyrant first her victim died,   Spite of his haughty mien, and barbarous pride.
10161-8{_}748{_}What boots the regal circle on his head,   His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;   That long behind he trails his pompous robe,   And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?
10161-8{_}749{_}The baron now his diamonds pours apace;   Th' embroidered king who shows but half his face,   And his refulgent queen, with powers combined,   Of broken troops an easy conquest find.
10161-8{_}750{_}Clubs, diamonds, hearts, in wild disorder seen,   With throngs promiscuous strew the level green.
10161-8{_}751{_}Thus when dispersed a routed army runs,   Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,   With like confusion different nations fly,   Of various habit, and of various dye,   The pierced battalions disunited fall,   In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.
10161-8{_}752{_}The knave of diamonds tries his wily arts,   And wins (oh shameful chance!)
10161-8{_}753{_}the queen of hearts.
10161-8{_}754{_}At this the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,   A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;   She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill,   Just in the jaws of ruin, and codille.
10161-8{_}755{_}And now (as oft in some distempered state)   On one nice trick depends the general fate.
10161-8{_}756{_}An ace of hearts steps forth; the king unseen   Lurked in her hand, and mourned his captive queen:   He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,   And falls like thunder on the prostrate ace.
10161-8{_}757{_}The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;   The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.
10161-8{_}758{_}Oh thoughtless mortals!
10161-8{_}759{_}ever blind to fate,   Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.
10161-8{_}760{_}Sudden, these honours shall be snatched away,   And cursed forever this victorious day.
10161-8{_}761{_}For lo!
10161-8{_}762{_}the board with cups and spoons is crowned,   The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;   On shining altars of Japan they raise   The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze;   From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,   While China's earth receives the smoking tide:   At once they gratify their scent and taste,   And frequent cups, prolong the rich repast.
10161-8{_}763{_}Straight hover round the fair her airy band;   Some, as she sipped, the fuming liquor fanned,   Some o'er her lap their careful plumes displayed,   Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.
10161-8{_}764{_}Coffee (which makes the politician wise,   And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)   Sent up in vapours to the baron's brain   New stratagems the radiant lock to gain.
10161-8{_}765{_}Ah, cease, rash youth!
10161-8{_}766{_}desist ere 'tis too late,   Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!
10161-8{_}767{_}Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,   She dearly pays for Nisus' injured hair!
10161-8{_}768{_}But when to mischief mortals bend their will,   How soon they find fit instruments of ill!
10161-8{_}769{_}Just then Clarissa drew with tempting grace   A two-edged weapon from her shining case:   So ladies in romance assist their knight,   Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.
10161-8{_}770{_}He takes the gift with reverence, and extends   The little engine on his fingers' ends;   This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,   As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.
10161-8{_}771{_}Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,   A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;   And thrice they twitched the diamond in her ear;   Thrice she looked back, and thrice the foe drew near.
10161-8{_}772{_}Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought   The close recesses of the virgin's thought;   As on the nosegay in her breast reclined,   He watched th' ideas rising in her mind,   Sudden he viewed, in spite of all her art,   An earthly lover lurking at her heart.
10161-8{_}773{_}Amazed, confused, he found his power expired,   Resigned to fate, and with a sigh retired.
10161-8{_}774{_}The peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide,   T' inclose the lock; now joins it, to divide.
10161-8{_}775{_}E'en then, before the fatal engine closed,   A wretched sylph too fondly interposed;   Fate urged the shears, and cut the sylph in twain   (But airy substance soon unites again).
10161-8{_}776{_}The meeting points the sacred hair dissever   From the fair head, forever, and forever!
10161-8{_}777{_}Then flashed the living lightning from her eyes,   And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.
10161-8{_}778{_}Not louder shrieks to pitying Heaven are cast,   When husbands, or when lap-dogs breathe their last;   Or when rich China vessels, fallen from high,   In glittering dust and painted fragments lie!
10161-8{_}779{_}'Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,'   The victor cried; 'the glorious prize is mine!
10161-8{_}780{_}While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,   Or in a coach and six the British fair,   As long as Atalantis shall be read,   Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,   While visits shall be paid on solemn days,   When numerous wax-lights in bright order blaze,   While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,   So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!
10161-8{_}781{_}What Time would spare, from steel receives its date,   And monuments, like men, submit to fate!
10161-8{_}782{_}Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,   And strike to dust th' imperial towers of Troy;   Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,   And hew triumphal arches to the ground.
10161-8{_}783{_}What wonder then, fair nymph!
10161-8{_}784{_}thy hairs should feel,   The conquering force of unresisted steel?'
10161-8{_}785{_}FROM TRANSLATION OF THE ILIAD    [THE PARTING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE]    'How would the sons of Troy, in arms renowned,   And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground,   Attaint the lustre of my former name,   Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?
10161-8{_}786{_}My early youth was bred to martial pains,   My soul impels me to th' embattled plains:   Let me be foremost to defend the throne,   And guard my father's glories and my own.
10161-8{_}787{_}Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates,   (How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)
10161-8{_}788{_}The day when thou, imperial Troy!
10161-8{_}789{_}must bend,   And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.
10161-8{_}790{_}And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,   My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,   Not Priam's hoary hairs defil'd with gore,   Not all my brothers gasping on the shore,   As thine, Andromache!
10161-8{_}791{_}Thy griefs I dread:   I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led,   In Argive looms our battles to design,   And woes of which so large a part was thine!
10161-8{_}792{_}To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring   The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring!
10161-8{_}793{_}There, while you groan beneath the load of life,   They cry, "Behold the mighty Hector's wife!"
10161-8{_}794{_}Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,   Embitters all thy woes by naming me.
10161-8{_}795{_}The thoughts of glory past and present shame,   A thousand griefs, shall waken at the name!
10161-8{_}796{_}May I lie cold before that dreadful day,   Pressed with a load of monumental clay!
10161-8{_}797{_}Thy Hector, wrapped, in everlasting sleep,   Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.'
10161-8{_}798{_}Thus having spoke, th' illustrious chief of Troy   Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.
10161-8{_}799{_}The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,   Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest.
10161-8{_}800{_}With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,   And Hector hasted to relieve his child;   The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,   And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.
10161-8{_}801{_}Then kissed the child, and, lifting high in air,   Thus to the gods preferred a father's prayer:    'O thou!
10161-8{_}802{_}whose glory fills th' ethereal throne,   And all ye deathless powers!
10161-8{_}803{_}protect my son!
10161-8{_}804{_}Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,   To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,   Against his country's foes the war to wage,   And rise the Hector of the future age!
10161-8{_}805{_}So when, triumphant from successful toils,   Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,   Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,   And say, "This chief transcends his father's fame":   While pleased, amidst the general shouts of Troy,   His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.'
10161-8{_}806{_}He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,   Restored the pleasing burthen to her arms;   Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,   Hushed to repose, and with a smile surveyed.
10161-8{_}807{_}The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,   She mingled with the smile a tender tear.
10161-8{_}808{_}The softened chief with kind compassion viewed,   And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:    'Andromache!
10161-8{_}809{_}my soul's far better part,   Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
10161-8{_}810{_}No hostile hand can antedate my doom,   Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.
10161-8{_}811{_}Fixed is the term to all the race of earth,   And such the hard condition of our birth.
10161-8{_}812{_}No force can then resist, no flight can save:   All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.
10161-8{_}813{_}No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,   There guide the spindle, and direct the loom;   Me glory summons to the martial scene,   The field of combat is the sphere for men.
10161-8{_}814{_}Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,   The first in danger as the first in fame.'
10161-8{_}815{_}From AN ESSAY ON MAN    OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN, WITH RESPECT TO THE UNIVERSE    Awake, my St. John!
10161-8{_}816{_}leave all meaner things   To low ambition, and the pride of kings.
10161-8{_}817{_}Let us (since life can little more supply   Than just to look about us, and to die)   Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;   A mighty maze!
10161-8{_}818{_}but not without a plan;   A wild, where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot;   Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
10161-8{_}819{_}Together let us beat this ample field,   Try what the open, what the covert yield;   The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore   Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;   Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,   And catch the manners living as they rise;   Laugh where we must, be candid where we can,   But vindicate the ways of God to man.
10161-8{_}820{_}I.
10161-8{_}821{_}Say first, of God above, or man below,   What can we reason, but from what we know?
10161-8{_}822{_}Of man, what see we but his station here   From which to reason or to which refer?
10161-8{_}823{_}Through worlds unnumbered though the God be known,   'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.
10161-8{_}824{_}He, who through vast immensity can pierce,   See worlds on worlds compose one universe,   Observe how system into system runs.
10161-8{_}825{_}What other planets circle other suns,   What varied being peoples every star,   May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.
10161-8{_}826{_}But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,   The strong connections, nice dependencies,   Gradations just, has thy pervading soul   Looked through?
10161-8{_}827{_}or can a part contain the whole?
10161-8{_}828{_}Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,   And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?
10161-8{_}829{_}II.
10161-8{_}830{_}Presumptuous man!
10161-8{_}831{_}the reason wouldst thou find,   Why formed so weak, so little, and so blind?
10161-8{_}832{_}First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,   Why formed no weaker, blinder, and no less?
10161-8{_}833{_}Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made   Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?
10161-8{_}834{_}Or ask of yonder argent fields above,   Why Jove's satellites are less than Jove.
10161-8{_}835{_}Of systems possible, if 'tis confessed   That wisdom infinite must form the best,   Where all must full or not coherent be,   And all that rises, rise in due degree;   Then, in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain,   There must be, somewhere, such a rank as man:   And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)   Is only this, if God has placed him wrong?
10161-8{_}836{_}Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,   May, must be right, as relative to all.
10161-8{_}837{_}In human works, though laboured on with pain,   A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;   In God's, one single can its end produce;   Yet serves to second too some other use.
10161-8{_}838{_}So man, who here seems principal alone,   Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,   Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;   'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.
10161-8{_}839{_}When the proud steed shall know why man restrains   His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains;   When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,   Is now a victim, and now Egypt's god:   Then shall man's pride and dulness comprehend   His actions', passions', being's, use and end;   Why doing, suffering, checked, impelled; and why   This hour a slave, the next a deity.
10161-8{_}840{_}Then say not man's imperfect, Heaven in fault;   Say rather, man's as perfect as he ought:   His knowledge measured to his state and place,   His time a moment, and a point his space.
10161-8{_}841{_}If to be perfect In a certain sphere,   What matter, soon or late, or here or there?
10161-8{_}842{_}The blest to-day is as completely so,   As who began a thousand years ago.
10161-8{_}843{_}III.
10161-8{_}844{_}Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,   All but the page prescribed, their present state:   From brutes what men, from men what spirits know   Or who could suffer being here below?
10161-8{_}845{_}The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,   Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?
10161-8{_}846{_}Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,   And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.
10161-8{_}847{_}Oh, blindness to the future!
10161-8{_}848{_}kindly given,   That each may fill the circle marked by Heaven:   Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,   A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,   Atoms or systems into ruin hurled,   And now a bubble burst, and now a world.
10161-8{_}849{_}Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;   Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.
10161-8{_}850{_}What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,   But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.
10161-8{_}851{_}Hope springs eternal in the human breast:   Man never is, but always to be blessed.
10161-8{_}852{_}The soul, uneasy and confined from home,   Bests and expatiates in a life to come.
10161-8{_}853{_}Lo, the poor Indian!
10161-8{_}854{_}whose untutored mind   Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;   His soul, proud science never taught to stray   Far as the solar walk, or milky way;   Yet simple nature to his hope has given,   Behind the cloud-topped hill, an humbler Heaven;   Some safer world in depths of woods embraced,   Some happier island in the watery waste,   Where slaves once more their native land behold,   No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.
10161-8{_}855{_}To be, contents his natural desire,   He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;   But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,   His faithful dog shall bear him company.
10161-8{_}856{_}IV.
10161-8{_}857{_}Go, wiser thou!
10161-8{_}858{_}and, in thy scale of sense   Weigh thy opinion against Providence;   Call imperfection what thou fanciest such,   Say, 'Here he gives too little, there too much;'   Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust,   Yet cry, 'If man's unhappy, God's unjust;'   If man alone engross not Heaven's high care,   Alone made perfect here, immortal there,   Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,   Bejudge his justice, be the god of God.
10161-8{_}859{_}In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies;   All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.
10161-8{_}860{_}Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,   Men would be angels, angels would be gods.
10161-8{_}861{_}Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell,   Aspiring to be angels, men rebel:   And who but wishes to invert the laws   Of order, sins against the Eternal Cause.
10161-8{_}862{_}V.   Ask for what end the heavenly bodies shine,   Earth for whose use?
10161-8{_}863{_}Pride answers, ''Tis for mine:   For me kind nature wakes her genial power,   Suckles each herb, and spreads out every flower;   Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew   The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;   For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;   For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;   Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;   My footstool earth, my canopy the skies.'
10161-8{_}864{_}But errs not Nature from this gracious end,   From burning suns when livid deaths descend,   When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep   Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?
10161-8{_}865{_}'No ('tis replied), the first Almighty Cause   Acts not by partial, but by general laws;   Th' exceptions few; some change, since all began:   And what created perfect?'
10161-8{_}866{_}Why then man?
10161-8{_}867{_}If the great end be human happiness,   Then nature deviates; and can man do less?
10161-8{_}868{_}As much that end a constant course requires   Of showers and sunshine, as of man's desires;   As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,   As men forever temperate, calm, and wise.
10161-8{_}869{_}If plagues or earthquakes break not Heaven's design,   Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?
10161-8{_}870{_}Who knows but He, whose hand the lightning forms,   Who heaves old ocean, and who wings the storms;   Pours fierce ambition in a Caesar's mind,   Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?
10161-8{_}871{_}From pride, from pride, our very reasoning springs.
10161-8{_}872{_}Account for moral, as for natural things:   Why charge we Heaven in those, in these acquit?
10161-8{_}873{_}In both, to reason right is to submit.
10161-8{_}874{_}Better for us, perhaps, it might appear,   Were there all harmony, all virtue here;   That never air or ocean felt the wind;   That never passion discomposed the mind.
10161-8{_}875{_}But all subsists by elemental strife;   And passions are the elements of life.
10161-8{_}876{_}The general order, since the whole began,   Is kept in nature, and is kept in man.
10161-8{_}877{_}VI.
10161-8{_}878{_}What would this man?
10161-8{_}879{_}Now upward will he soar,   And little less than angel, would he more;   Now looking downwards, just as grieved appears   To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.
10161-8{_}880{_}Made for his use all creatures if he call,   Say what their use, had he the powers of all?
10161-8{_}881{_}Nature to these, without profusion, kind,   The proper organs, proper powers assigned;   Each seeming want compensated of course,   Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;   All in exact proportion to the state;   Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.
10161-8{_}882{_}Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:   Is Heaven unkind to man, and man alone?
10161-8{_}883{_}Shall he alone, whom rational we call,   Be pleased with nothing, if not blessed with all?
10161-8{_}884{_}The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find)   Is not to act or think beyond mankind;   No powers of body or of soul to share,   But what his nature and his state can bear.
10161-8{_}885{_}Why has not man a microscopic eye?
10161-8{_}886{_}For this plain reason, man is not a fly.
10161-8{_}887{_}Say what the use, were finer optics given,   T' inspect a mite, not comprehend the heaven?
10161-8{_}888{_}Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,   To smart and agonize at every pore?
10161-8{_}889{_}Or quick effluvia darting through the brain,   Die of a rose in aromatic pain?
10161-8{_}890{_}If nature thundered in his opening ears,   And stunned him with the music of the spheres,   How would he wish that Heaven had left him still   The whispering zephyr, and the purling rill?
10161-8{_}891{_}Who finds not Providence all good and wise,   Alike in what it gives and what denies?
10161-8{_}892{_}VII.
10161-8{_}893{_}Far as creation's ample range extends,   The scale of sensual, mental power ascends.
10161-8{_}894{_}Mark how it mounts, to man's imperial race,   From the green myriads in the peopled grass:   What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,   The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:   Of smell, the headlong lioness between   And hound sagacious on the tainted green:   Of hearing, from the life that fills the flood,   To that which warbles through the vernal wood:   The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!
10161-8{_}895{_}Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:   In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true   From poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew?
10161-8{_}896{_}How instinct varies in the grovelling swine,   Compared, half-reasoning elephant, with thine!
10161-8{_}897{_}'Twixt that and reason, what a nice barrier,   Forever separate, yet forever near!
10161-8{_}898{_}Remembrance and reflection how allied;   What thin partitions sense from thought divide:   And middle natures, how they long to join,   Yet never pass th' insuperable line!
10161-8{_}899{_}Without this just gradation, could they be   Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?
10161-8{_}900{_}The powers of all subdued by thee alone,   Is not thy reason all these powers in one?
10161-8{_}901{_}VIII.
10161-8{_}902{_}See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth   All matter quick, and bursting into birth.
10161-8{_}903{_}Above, how high, progressive life may go!
10161-8{_}904{_}Around, how wide!
10161-8{_}905{_}how deep extend below!
10161-8{_}906{_}Vast chain of being!
10161-8{_}907{_}which from God began,   Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,   Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,   No glass can reach; from infinite to thee,   From thee to nothing.--On superior powers   Were we to pass, Inferior might on ours;   Or in the full creation leave a void,   Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed:   From nature's chain whatever link you strike,   Tenth, or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.
10161-8{_}908{_}And, if each system in gradation roll   Alike essential to th' amazing whole,   The least confusion but in one, not all   That system only, but the whole must fall.
10161-8{_}909{_}Let earth unbalanced from her orbit fly,   Planets and suns run lawless through the sky;   Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurled,   Being on being wrecked, and world on world;   Heaven's whole foundations to their centre nod,   And nature tremble to the throne of God.
10161-8{_}910{_}All this dread order break--for whom?
10161-8{_}911{_}for thee?
10161-8{_}912{_}Vile worm!--Oh, madness!
10161-8{_}913{_}pride!
10161-8{_}914{_}impiety!
10161-8{_}915{_}IX.
10161-8{_}916{_}What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread,   Or hand, to toil, aspired to be the head?
10161-8{_}917{_}What if the head, the eye, or ear repined   To serve mere engines to the ruling mind?
10161-8{_}918{_}Just as absurd for any part to claim   To be another, in this general frame;   Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,   The great directing Mind of all ordains.
10161-8{_}919{_}All are but parts of one stupendous whole,   Whose body nature is, and God the soul;   That, changed through all, and yet in all the same;   Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame;   Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,   Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,   Lives through all life, extends through all extent,   Spreads undivided, operates unspent;   Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,   As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;   As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,   As the rapt seraph that adores and burns:   To him no high, no low, no great, no small;   He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.
10161-8{_}920{_}X.
10161-8{_}921{_}Cease then, nor order imperfection name:   Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.
10161-8{_}922{_}Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree   Of blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee.
10161-8{_}923{_}Submit.--In this, or any other sphere,   Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:   Safe in the hand of one disposing Power,   Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
10161-8{_}924{_}All nature is but art, unknown to thee;   All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;   All discord, harmony not understood;   All partial evil, universal good:   And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,   One truth is clear, _Whatever is, is right_.
10161-8{_}925{_}[MAN'S POWERS AND FRAILTIES]    Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;   The proper study of mankind is Man.
10161-8{_}926{_}Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,   A being darkly wise, and rudely great:   With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,   With too much weakness for the stoic's pride,   He hangs between; in doubt to act or rest,   In doubt to deem himself a god or beast;   In doubt his mind or body to prefer,   Born but to die, and reasoning but to err;   Alike in ignorance, his reason such   Whether he thinks too little or too much:   Chaos of thought and passion, all confused;   Still by himself abused, or disabused;   Created half to rise, and half to fall;   Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;   Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled:   The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!
10161-8{_}927{_}[VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS]    Oh blind to truth, and God's whole scheme below,   Who fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe!
10161-8{_}928{_}Who sees and follows that great scheme the best,   Best knows the blessing, and will most be blessed.
10161-8{_}929{_}But fools, the good alone unhappy call,   For ills or accidents that chance to all.
10161-8{_}930{_}See Falkland dies, the virtuous and the just!
10161-8{_}931{_}See godlike Turenne prostrate on the dust!
10161-8{_}932{_}See Sidney bleeds amid the martial strife!
10161-8{_}933{_}Was this their virtue, or contempt of life?
10161-8{_}934{_}Say, was it virtue, more though Heaven ne'er gave,   Lamented Digby!
10161-8{_}935{_}sunk thee to the grave?
10161-8{_}936{_}Tell me, if virtue made the son expire,   Why, full of days and honour, lives the sire?
10161-8{_}937{_}Why drew Marseilles' good bishop purer breath,   When nature sickened, and each gale was death?
10161-8{_}938{_}Or why so long (in life if long can be)   Lent Heaven a parent to the poor and me?
10161-8{_}939{_}What makes all physical or moral ill?
10161-8{_}940{_}There deviates nature, and here wanders will.
10161-8{_}941{_}God sends not ill; if rightly understood,   Or partial ill is universal good.
10161-8{_}942{_}Or change admits, or nature lets it fall,   Short, and but rare, till man improved it all.
10161-8{_}943{_}We just as wisely might of Heaven complain   That righteous Abel was destroyed by Cain,   As that the virtuous son is ill at ease,   When his lewd father gave the dire disease.
10161-8{_}944{_}Think we, like some weak prince, th' Eternal Cause   Prone for his favourites to reverse his laws?
10161-8{_}945{_}Shall burning Etna, if a sage requires,   Forget to thunder, and recall her fires?
10161-8{_}946{_}On air or sea new motions be impressed,   Oh blameless Bethel!
10161-8{_}947{_}to relieve thy breast?
10161-8{_}948{_}When the loose mountain trembles from on high,   Shall gravitation cease, if you go by?
10161-8{_}949{_}Or some old temple, nodding to its fall,   For Chartres' head reserve the hanging wall?
10161-8{_}950{_}But still this world (so fitted for the knave)   Contents us not.
10161-8{_}951{_}A better shall we have?
10161-8{_}952{_}A kingdom of the just then let it be:   But first consider how those just agree.
10161-8{_}953{_}The good must merit God's peculiar care;   But who, but God, can tell us who they are?
10161-8{_}954{_}One thinks on Calvin Heaven's own spirit fell;   Another deems him instrument of hell;   If Calvin feel Heaven's blessing, or its rod.
10161-8{_}955{_}This cries, there is, and that, there is no God.
10161-8{_}956{_}What shocks one part will edify the rest,   Nor with one system can they all he blessed.
10161-8{_}957{_}The very best will variously incline,   And what rewards your virtue, punish mine.
10161-8{_}958{_}_Whatever is, is right_.--This world 'tis true   Was made for Caesar--but for Titus too.
10161-8{_}959{_}And which more blessed?
10161-8{_}960{_}who chained his country, say,   Or he whose virtue sighed to lose a day?
10161-8{_}961{_}'But sometimes virtue starves, while vice is fed,'   What then?
10161-8{_}962{_}Is the reward of virtue bread?
10161-8{_}963{_}That, vice may merit, 'tis the price of toil;   The knave deserves it, when he tills the soil,   The knave deserves it when he tempts the main,   Where folly fights for kings, or dives for gain.
10161-8{_}964{_}The good man may be weak, be indolent:   Nor is his claim to plenty, but content.
10161-8{_}965{_}But grant him riches, your demand is o'er;   'No--shall the good want health, the good want power?'
10161-8{_}966{_}Add health, and power, and every earthly thing.
10161-8{_}967{_}'Why bounded power?
10161-8{_}968{_}why private?
10161-8{_}969{_}why no king?'
10161-8{_}970{_}Nay, why external for internal given?
10161-8{_}971{_}Why is not man a god, and earth a Heaven?
10161-8{_}972{_}Who ask and reason thus, will scarce conceive   God gives enough, while he has more to give:   Immense the power, immense were the demand;   Say, at what part of nature will they stand?
10161-8{_}973{_}What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,   The soul's calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy,   Is virtue's prize: A better would you fix?
10161-8{_}974{_}Then give humility a coach and six,   Justice a conqueror's sword, or truth a gown,   Or public spirit its great cure, a crown.
10161-8{_}975{_}Weak, foolish man!
10161-8{_}976{_}will Heaven reward us there   With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?
10161-8{_}977{_}The boy and man an individual makes,   Yet sigh'st thou now for apples and for cakes?
10161-8{_}978{_}Go, like the Indian, in another life   Expect thy dog, thy bottle, and thy wife,   As well as dream such trifles are assigned,   As toys and empires, for a god-like mind.
10161-8{_}979{_}Rewards, that either would to virtue bring   No joy, or be destructive of the thing:   How oft by these at sixty are undone   The virtues of a saint at twenty-one!
10161-8{_}980{_}To whom can riches give repute, or trust,   Content, or pleasure, but the good and just?
10161-8{_}981{_}Judges and senates have been bought for gold,   Esteem and love were never to be sold.
10161-8{_}982{_}Oh fool!
10161-8{_}983{_}to think God hates the worthy mind,   The lover and the love of human-kind,   Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear,   Because he wants a thousand pounds a year.
10161-8{_}984{_}Honour and shame from no condition rise;   Act well your part, there all the honour lies.
10161-8{_}985{_}Fortune in men has some small difference made,   One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;   The cobbler aproned, and the parson gowned,   The friar hooded, and the monarch crowned.
10161-8{_}986{_}'What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?'
10161-8{_}987{_}I'll tell you, friend!
10161-8{_}988{_}a wise man and a fool.
10161-8{_}989{_}You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,   Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk,   Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow,   The rest is all but leather or prunella.
10161-8{_}990{_}*       *       *       *       *    God loves from whole to parts; but human soul   Must rise from individual to whole.
10161-8{_}991{_}Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake,   As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake;   The centre moved, a circle straight succeeds,   Another still, and still another spreads;   Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace;   His country next; and next all human race;   Wide and more wide, th' o'erflowings of the mind   Take every creature in, of every kind;   Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blessed,   And Heaven beholds its image in his breast.
10161-8{_}992{_}Come then, my friend!
10161-8{_}993{_}my Genius!
10161-8{_}994{_}come along;   Oh master of the poet, and the song!
10161-8{_}995{_}And while the Muse now stoops, or now ascends,   To man's low passions, or their glorious ends,   Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise,   To fall with dignity, with temper rise;   Formed by thy converse, happily to steer   From grave to gay, from lively to severe;   Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease,   Intent to reason, or polite to please.
10161-8{_}996{_}Oh!
10161-8{_}997{_}while along the stream of time thy name   Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame,   Say, shall my little bark attendant sail,   Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?
10161-8{_}998{_}When statesmen, heroes, kings, in dust repose,   Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes,   Shall then this verse to future age pretend   Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend?
10161-8{_}999{_}That urged by thee, I turned the tuneful art   From sounds to things, from fancy to the heart;   For wit's false mirror held up Nature's light;   Shewed erring pride, _Whatever is, is right;_   That reason, passion, answer one great aim;   That true self-love and social are the same;   That virtue only, makes our bliss below;   And all our knowledge is, _ourselves to know_.
10161-8{_}1000{_}FROM MORAL ESSAYS    OF THE CHARACTERS OF WOMEN    Nothing so true as what you once let fall,   'Most women have no characters at all.'

10161-8{_}1002{_}How many pictures of one nymph we view,   All how unlike each other, all how true!
10161-8{_}1003{_}Arcadia's countess, here in ermined pride,   Is there Pastora by a fountain side;   Here Fannia, leering on her own good man,   And there, a naked Leda with a swan.
10161-8{_}1004{_}Let then the fair one beautifully cry,   In Magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye,   Or dressed in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine,   With simpering angels, palms, and harps divine;   Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it,   If folly grow romantic, I must paint it.

10161-8{_}1006{_}Then for all death, that opiate of the soul!
10161-8{_}1007{_}Lucretia's dagger, Rosamonda's bowl.
10161-8{_}1008{_}Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?
10161-8{_}1009{_}A spark too fickle, or a spouse too kind.
10161-8{_}1010{_}Wise wretch!
10161-8{_}1011{_}with pleasures too refined to please;   With too much spirit to be e'er at ease;   With too much quickness ever to be taught;   With too much thinking to have common thought:   You purchase pain with all that joy can give,   And die of nothing but a rage to live.
10161-8{_}1012{_}Turn then from wits; and look on Simo's mate,   No ass so meek, no ass so obstinate;   Or her, that owns her faults, but never mends,   Because she's honest, and the best of friends;   Or her, whose life the Church and scandal share,   Forever in a passion, or a prayer;   Or her, who laughs at hell, but (like her Grace)   Cries, 'Ah!
10161-8{_}1013{_}how charming, if there's no such place!'
10161-8{_}1014{_}Or who in sweet vicissitude appears   Of mirth and opium, ratafie and tears,   The daily anodyne, and nightly draught,   To kill those foes to fair ones, time and thought.
10161-8{_}1015{_}Woman and fool are two hard things to hit;   For true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.
10161-8{_}1016{_}But what are these to great Atossa's mind?
10161-8{_}1017{_}Scarce once herself, by turns all womankind!
10161-8{_}1018{_}Who, with herself, or others, from her birth   Finds all her life one warfare upon earth;   Shines, in exposing knaves, and painting fools,   Yet is, whate'er she hates and ridicules.
10161-8{_}1019{_}No thought advances, but her eddy brain   Whisks it about, and down it goes again.
10161-8{_}1020{_}Full sixty years the world has been her trade,   The wisest fool much time has ever made.
10161-8{_}1021{_}From loveless youth to unrespected age,   No passion gratified except her rage.
10161-8{_}1022{_}So much the fury still outran the wit,   The pleasure missed her, and the scandal hit.
10161-8{_}1023{_}Who breaks with her, provokes revenge from hell,   But he's a bolder man who dares be well.
10161-8{_}1024{_}Her every turn with violence pursued,   Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude:   To that each passion turns, or soon or late;   Love, if it makes her yield, must make her hate:   Superiors?

10161-8{_}1026{_}and equals?
10161-8{_}1027{_}what a curse!

10161-8{_}1029{_}worse.
10161-8{_}1030{_}Offend her, and she knows not to forgive;   Oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live;   But die, and she'll adore you--then the bust   And temple rise--then fall again to dust.
10161-8{_}1031{_}Last night, her lord was all that's good and great;   A knave this morning, and his will a cheat.
10161-8{_}1032{_}Strange!
10161-8{_}1033{_}by the means defeated of the ends,   By spirit robbed of power, by warmth of friends,   By wealth of followers!
10161-8{_}1034{_}without one distress,   Sick of herself through very selfishness!
10161-8{_}1035{_}Atossa, cursed with every granted prayer,   Childless with all her children, wants an heir.

10161-8{_}1037{_}Pictures like these, dear Madam, to design,   Asks no firm hand, and no unerring line;   Some wandering touches, some reflected light,   Some flying stroke alone can hit them right:   For how should equal colours do the knack?

10161-8{_}1039{_}'Yet Chloe sure was formed without a spot'--   Nature in her then erred not, but forgot.
10161-8{_}1040{_}'With every pleasing, every prudent part,   Say, what can Chloe want?'
10161-8{_}1041{_}--She wants a heart.
10161-8{_}1042{_}She speaks, behaves, and acts just as she ought;   But never, never, reached one generous thought.
10161-8{_}1043{_}Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour,   Content to dwell in decencies forever.
10161-8{_}1044{_}So very reasonable, so unmoved,   As never yet to love, or to be loved.
10161-8{_}1045{_}She, while her lover pants upon her breast,   Can mark the figures on an Indian chest;   And when she sees her friend in deep despair,   Observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair.
10161-8{_}1046{_}Forbid it Heaven, a favour or a debt   She e'er should cancel--but she may forget.
10161-8{_}1047{_}Safe is your secret still in Chloe's ear;   But none of Chloe's shall you ever hear.

10161-8{_}1116{_}Happy my studies, when by these approved!

10161-8{_}1119{_}Soft were my numbers; who could take offence   While pure description held the place of sense?
10161-8{_}1120{_}Like gentle Fanny's was my flowery theme,   A painted mistress, or a purling stream.

10161-8{_}1123{_}If want provoked, or madness made them print,   I waged no war with Bedlam or the Mint.

10161-8{_}1134{_}The bard whom pilfered Pastorals renown,   Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown,   Just writes to make his barrenness appear,   And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year;   He, who still wanting, though he lives on theft,   Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left;   And he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning,   Means not, but blunders round about a meaning;   And he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad,   It is not poetry, but prose run mad:   All these, my modest satire bade translate,   And owned that nine such poets made a Tate.

10161-8{_}1157{_}Born to no pride, inheriting no strife,   Nor marrying discord in a noble wife,   Stranger to civil and religious rage,   The good man walked innoxious through his age.

10161-8{_}1174{_}Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires,   Why should not we be wiser than our sires?
10161-8{_}1175{_}In every public virtue we excel,   We build, we paint, we sing, we dance as well.
10161-8{_}1176{_}And learned Athens to our art must stoop,   Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop.

10161-8{_}1178{_}Shall we, or shall we not, account him so,   Who died, perhaps, a hundred years ago?
10161-8{_}1179{_}End all dispute; and fix the year precise   When British bards begin t' immortalize?
10161-8{_}1180{_}'Who lasts a century can have no flaw,   I hold that wit a classic, good in law.'
10161-8{_}1181{_}Suppose he wants a year, will you compound?
10161-8{_}1182{_}And shall we deem him ancient, right and sound,   Or damn to all eternity at once,   At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?
10161-8{_}1183{_}'We shall not quarrel for a year or two;   By courtesy of England, he may do.'
10161-8{_}1184{_}Then, by the rule that made the horse-tail bare,   I pluck out year by year, as hair by hair,   And melt down ancients like a heap of snow:   While you, to measure merits, look in Stowe,   And estimating authors by the year,   Bestow a garland only on a bier.
10161-8{_}1185{_}Shakespeare, (whom you and every play-house bill   Style the divine, the matchless, what you will,)   For gain, not glory, winged his roving flight,   And grew immortal in his own despite.

10161-8{_}1192{_}These, only these, support the crowded stage,   From eldest Heywood down to Cibber's age.'
10161-8{_}1193{_}All this may be; the people's voice is odd,   It is, and it is not, the voice of God.
10161-8{_}1194{_}To Gammer Gurton if it give the bays,   And yet deny the Careless Husband praise,   Or say our fathers never broke a rule;   Why then, I say, the public is a fool.

10161-8{_}1196{_}Spenser himself affects the obsolete,   And Sidney's verse halts ill on Roman feet:   Milton's strong pinion now not heaven can bound,   Now serpent-like, in prose he sweeps the ground,   In quibbles angel and archangel join,   And God the Father turns a school-divine.
10161-8{_}1197{_}Not that I'd lop the beauties from his book,   Like slashing Bentley with his desperate hook,   Or damn all Shakespeare, like th' affected fool   At court, who hates whate'er he read at school.

10161-8{_}1199{_}I lose my patience, and I owe it too,   When works are censured, not as bad but new;   While if our elders break all reason's laws,   These fools demand not pardon, but applause.
10161-8{_}1200{_}On Avon's bank, where flowers eternal blow,   If I but ask, if any weed can grow;   One tragic sentence if I dare deride   Which Betterton's grave action dignified,   Or well-mouthed Booth with emphasis proclaims,   (Though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names,)   How will our fathers rise up in a rage,   And swear all shame is lost in George's age!

10161-8{_}1339{_}FROM TRIVIA    If clothed in black you tread the busy town,   Or if distinguished by the reverend gown,   Three trades avoid: oft in the mingling press   The barber's apron soils the sable dress;   Shun the perfumer's touch with cautious eye,   Nor let the baker's step advance too nigh.
10161-8{_}1340{_}Ye walkers too that youthful colours wear,   Three sullying trades avoid with equal care:   The little chimney-sweeper skulks along,   And marks with sooty stains the heedless throng;   When 'Small-coal!'
10161-8{_}1341{_}murmurs in the hoarser throat,   From smutty dangers guard thy threatened coat;   The dust-man's cart offends thy clothes and eyes,   When through the street a cloud of ashes flies.
10161-8{_}1342{_}But whether black or lighter dyes are worn,   The chandler's basket, on his shoulder borne,   With tallow spots thy coat; resign the way   To shun the surly butcher's greasy tray--   Butchers whose hands are dyed with blood's foul stain,   And always foremost in the hangman's train.
10161-8{_}1343{_}Let due civilities be strictly paid:   The wall surrender to the hooded maid,   Nor let thy sturdy elbow's hasty rage   Jostle the feeble steps of trembling age;   And when the porter bends beneath his load,   And pants for breath, clear thou the crowded road;   But, above all, the groping blind direct,   And from the pressing throng the lame protect.
10161-8{_}1344{_}You'll sometimes meet a fop, of nicest tread,   Whose mantling peruke veils his empty head;   At every step he dreads the wall to lose   And risks, to save a coach, his red-heeled shoes:   Him, like the miller, pass with caution by,   Lest from his shoulder clouds of powder fly.
10161-8{_}1345{_}But when the bully, with assuming pace,   Cocks his broad hat, edged round with tarnished lace,   Yield not the way; defy his strutting pride,   And thrust him to the muddy kennel's side;   He never turns again nor dares oppose,   But mutters coward curses as he goes.
10161-8{_}1346{_}SWEET WILLIAM'S FAREWELL TO BLACK-EYED SUSAN    All in the Downs the fleet was moored,   The streamers waving in the wind,   When black-eyed Susan came aboard:   'Oh, where shall I my true love find?
10161-8{_}1347{_}Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true   If my sweet William sails among the crew?'
10161-8{_}1348{_}William, who high upon the yard   Rocked with the billow to and fro,   Soon as her well-known voice he heard,   He sighed and cast his eyes below;   The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,   And, quick as lightning, on the deck he stands.
10161-8{_}1349{_}So the sweet lark, high poised in air,   Shuts close his pinions to his breast,   If chance his mate's shrill call he hear,   And drops at once into her nest.
10161-8{_}1350{_}The noblest captain in the British fleet   Mighty envy William's lip those kisses sweet.
10161-8{_}1351{_}'O, Susan, Susan, lovely dear,   My vows shall ever true remain!
10161-8{_}1352{_}Let me kiss off that falling tear:   We only part to meet again.
10161-8{_}1353{_}Change as ye list, ye winds!
10161-8{_}1354{_}my heart shall be   The faithful compass that still points to thee.
10161-8{_}1355{_}'Believe not what the landmen say,   Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind:   They'll tell thee sailors, when away,   In every port a mistress find--   Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,   For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.
10161-8{_}1356{_}'If to far India's coast we sail,   Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright;   Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,   Thy skin is ivory so white.
10161-8{_}1357{_}Thus every beauteous object that I view   Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.
10161-8{_}1358{_}'Though battle call me from thy arms,   Let not my pretty Susan mourn;   Though cannons roar, yet, safe from harms,   William shall to his dear return.
10161-8{_}1359{_}Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,   Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye.'
10161-8{_}1360{_}The boatswain gave the dreadful word;   The sails their swelling bosom spread;   No longer must she stay aboard:   They kissed--she sighed--he hung his head.
10161-8{_}1361{_}Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land;   'Adieu!'
10161-8{_}1362{_}she cries, and waved her lily hand.

10161-8{_}1364{_}SAMUEL CROXALL     FROM THE VISION    Pensive beneath a spreading oak I stood   That veiled the hollow channel of the flood:   Along whose shelving bank the violet blue   And primrose pale in lovely mixture grew.
10161-8{_}1365{_}High overarched the bloomy woodbine hung,   The gaudy goldfinch from the maple sung;   The little warbling minstrel of the shade   To the gay morn her due devotion paid   Next, the soft linnet echoing to the thrush   With carols filled the smelling briar-bush;   While Philomel attuned her artless throat,   And from the hawthorn breathed a trilling note.
10161-8{_}1366{_}Indulgent Nature smiled in every part,   And filled with joy unknown my ravished heart:   Attent I listened while the feathered throng   Alternate finished and renewed their song.

10161-8{_}1368{_}How silent did his old companions tread,   By midnight lamps, the mansions of the dead,   Through breathing statues, then unheeded things,   Through rows of warriors, and through walks of kings!
10161-8{_}1369{_}What awe did the slow solemn knell inspire;   The pealing organ, and the pausing choir;   The duties by the lawn-robed prelate paid;   And the last words, that dust to dust conveyed!
10161-8{_}1370{_}While speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend,   Accept these tears, thou dear departed friend.
10161-8{_}1371{_}Oh, gone forever!
10161-8{_}1372{_}take this long adieu;   And sleep in peace next thy loved Montague!
10161-8{_}1373{_}To strew fresh laurels, let the task be mine,   A frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine;   Mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan,   And grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone.
10161-8{_}1374{_}If e'er from me thy loved memorial part,   May shame afflict this alienated heart;   Of thee forgetful if I form a song,   My lyre be broken, and untuned my tongue,   My griefs be doubled from thy image free,   And mirth a torment, unchastised by thee!
10161-8{_}1375{_}Oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone,   (Sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown)   Along the walls where speaking marbles show   What worthies form the hallowed mould below;   Proud names, who once the reins of empire held;   In arms who triumphed, or in arts excelled;    Chiefs graced with scars and prodigal of blood;   Stern patriots who for sacred freedom stood;   Just men by whom impartial laws were given;   And saints who taught and led the way to Heaven.
10161-8{_}1376{_}Ne'er to these chambers, where the mighty rest,   Since their foundation came a nobler guest;   Nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed   A fairer spirit or more welcome shade.

10161-8{_}1380{_}THOMAS PARNELL     FROM A NIGHT-PIECE ON DEATH    By the blue taper's trembling light,   No more I waste the wakeful night,   Intent with endless view to pore   The schoolmen and the sages o'er;   Their books from wisdom widely stray,   Or point at best the longest way.
10161-8{_}1381{_}I'll seek a readier path, and go   Where wisdom's surely taught below.
10161-8{_}1382{_}How deep yon azure dyes the sky,   Where orbs of gold unnumbered lie,   While through their ranks in silver pride   The nether crescent seems to glide!
10161-8{_}1383{_}The slumbering breeze forgets to breathe,   The lake is smooth and clear beneath,   Where once again the spangled show   Descends to meet our eyes below.
10161-8{_}1384{_}The grounds which on the right aspire,   In dimness from the view retire:   The left presents a place of graves,   Whose wall the silent water laves.
10161-8{_}1385{_}That steeple guides thy doubtful sight   Among the livid gleams of night.
10161-8{_}1386{_}There pass, with melancholy state,   By all the solemn heaps of fate,   And think, as softly-sad you tread   Above the venerable dead,   'Time was, like thee they life possessed,   And time shall be, that thou shalt rest.'
10161-8{_}1387{_}Those graves, with bending osier bound,   That nameless heave the crumbled ground,   Quick to the glancing thought disclose,   Where toil and poverty repose.
10161-8{_}1388{_}The flat smooth stones that bear a name,   The chisel's slender help to fame,   (Which ere our set of friends decay   Their frequent steps may wear away;)   A middle race of mortals own,   Men, half ambitious, all unknown.
10161-8{_}1389{_}The marble tombs that rise on high,   Whose dead in vaulted arches lie,   Whose pillars swell with sculptured stones,   Arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones;   These, all the poor remains of state,   Adorn the rich, or praise the great;   Who while on earth in fame they live,   Are senseless of the fame they give.
10161-8{_}1390{_}Ha!

10161-8{_}1399{_}Sweet delight of humankind!

10161-8{_}1402{_}What happy region dost thou please   To make the seat of calms and ease?
10161-8{_}1403{_}Ambition searches all its sphere   Of pomp and state, to meet thee there.
10161-8{_}1404{_}Increasing Avarice would find   Thy presence in its gold enshrined.
10161-8{_}1405{_}The bold adventurer ploughs his way,   Through rocks amidst the foaming sea,   To gain thy love; and then perceives   Thou wert not in the rocks and waves.
10161-8{_}1406{_}The silent heart which grief assails,   Treads soft and lonesome o'er the vales,   Sees daisies open, rivers run,   And seeks, as I have vainly done,   Amusing thought; but learns to know   That solitude's the nurse of woe.
10161-8{_}1407{_}No real happiness is found   In trailing purple o'er the ground;   Or in a soul exalted high,   To range the circuit of the sky,   Converse with stars above, and know   All nature in its forms below;   The rest it seeks, in seeking dies,   And doubts at last, for knowledge, rise.
10161-8{_}1408{_}Lovely, lasting peace, appear!
10161-8{_}1409{_}This world itself, if thou art here,   Is once again with Eden blest,   And man contains it in his breast.
10161-8{_}1410{_}'Twas thus, as under shade I stood,   I sung my wishes to the wood,   And lost in thought, no more perceived   The branches whisper as they waved:   It seemed, as all the quiet place   Confess'd the presence of the Grace.
10161-8{_}1411{_}When thus she spoke--'Go rule thy will,   Bid thy wild passions all be still,   Know God, and bring thy heart to know   The joys which from religion flow;   Then every grace shall prove its guest,   And I'll be there to crown the rest.'
10161-8{_}1412{_}Oh!
10161-8{_}1413{_}by yonder mossy seat,   In my hours of sweet retreat,   Might I thus my soul employ,   With sense of gratitude and joy!
10161-8{_}1414{_}Raised as ancient prophets were,   In heavenly vision, praise, and prayer;   Pleasing all men, hurting none,   Pleased and blessed with God alone;   Then while the gardens take my sight,   With all the colours of delight;   While silver waters glide along,   To please my ear, and court my song;   I'll lift my voice, and tune my string,   And thee, great Source of nature, sing.
10161-8{_}1415{_}The sun that walks his airy way,   To light the world, and give the day;   The moon that shines with borrowed light;   The stars that gild the gloomy night;   The seas that roll unnumbered waves;   The wood that spreads its shady leaves;   The field whose ears conceal the grain,   The yellow treasure of the plain;   All of these, and all I see,   Should be sung, and sung by me:   They speak their Maker as they can,   But want and ask the tongue of man.
10161-8{_}1416{_}Go search among your idle dreams,   Your busy or your vain extremes;   And find a life of equal bliss,   Or own the next begun in this.

10161-8{_}1436{_}Last morning I was gay and early out;   Upon a dyke I leaned, glowring about.
10161-8{_}1437{_}I saw my Meg come linkan o'er the lea;   I saw my Meg, but Peggy saw na me,   For yet the sun was wading thro' the mist,   And she was close upon me e'er she wist:   Her coats were kiltit, and did sweetly shaw   Her straight bare legs, that whiter were than snaw.
10161-8{_}1438{_}Her cockernony snooded up fou sleek,   Her haffet-locks hang waving on her cheek;   Her cheeks sae ruddy, and her een sae clear;   And, oh, her mouth's like ony hinny pear;   Neat, neat she was in bustine waistcoat clean,   As she came skiffing o'er the dewy green.

10161-8{_}1443{_}I trow when, that she saw, within a crack   She came with a right thieveless errand back:   Misca'd me first; then bade me hound my dog,   To wear up three waff ewes strayed on the bog.
10161-8{_}1444{_}I leugh, an sae did she: then with great haste   I clasped my arms about her neck and waist,   About her yielding waist, and took a fourth   Of sweetest kisses frae her glowing mouth;   While hard and fast I held her in my grips,   My very saul came louping to my lips;   Sair, sair she flet wi' me 'tween ilka smack,   But weel I kenned she meant nae as she spak.
10161-8{_}1445{_}Dear Roger, when your jo puts on her gloom,   Do ye sae too and never fash your thumb:   Seem to forsake her, soon she'll change her mood;   Gae woo anither, and she'll gang clean wood.
10161-8{_}1446{_}Dear Roger, if your Jenny geck,   And answer kindness with a slight,   Seem unconcerned at her neglect;   For women in a man delight,   But them despise who're soon defeat   And with a simple face give way   To a repulse: then he not blate;   Push bauldly on, and win the day.
10161-8{_}1447{_}When maidens, innocently young,   Say aften what they never mean,   Ne'er mind their pretty lying tongue,   But tent the language of their een:   If these agree, and she persist   To answer all your love with hate,   Seek elsewhere to be better blest,   And let her sigh when'tis too late.

10161-8{_}1453{_}Simple maiden, void of art,   Babbling out the very heart,   Yet abandoned to thy will,   Yet imagining no ill,   Yet too innocent to blush;   Like the linnet in the bush,   To the mother-linnet's note   Moduling her slender throat,   Chirping forth thy pretty joys;   Wanton in the change of toys,   Like the linnet green, in May,   Flitting to each bloomy spray;    Wearied then, and glad of rest,   Like the linnet in the nest.

10161-8{_}1460{_}Sooner or later, of all height,   Withdraw their summits from the skies,   And lessen as the others rise:   Still the prospect wider spreads,   Adds a thousand woods and meads;   Still it widens, widens still,   And sinks the newly-risen hill.
10161-8{_}1461{_}Now I gain the mountain's brow,   What a landscape lies below!
10161-8{_}1462{_}No clouds, no vapours intervene,   But the gay, the open scene   Does the face of nature shew,   In all the hues of heaven's bow!
10161-8{_}1463{_}And, swelling to embrace the light,   Spreads around beneath the sight.
10161-8{_}1464{_}Old castles on the cliffs arise,   Proudly towering in the skies!
10161-8{_}1465{_}Rushing from the woods, the spires   Seem from hence ascending fires!
10161-8{_}1466{_}Half his beams Apollo sheds   On the yellow mountain-heads!
10161-8{_}1467{_}Gilds the fleeces of the flocks,   And glitters on the broken rocks!
10161-8{_}1468{_}Below me trees unnumbered rise,   Beautiful in various dyes:   The gloomy pine, the poplar blue,   The yellow beech, the sable yew,   The slender fir, that taper grows,   The sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs;   And beyond the purple grove,   Haunt of Phillis, queen of love!
10161-8{_}1469{_}Gaudy as the opening dawn,   Lies a long and level lawn   On which a dark hill, steep and high,   Holds and charms the wandering eye!
10161-8{_}1470{_}Deep are his feet in Towy's flood,   His sides are clothed with waving wood,   And ancient towers crown his brow,   That cast an awful look below;   Whose ragged walls the ivy creeps,   And with her arms from falling keeps;   So both a safety from the wind   On mutual dependence find.
10161-8{_}1471{_}'Tis now the raven's bleak abode;   'Tis now th' apartment of the toad;   And there the fox securely feeds;   And there the poisonous adder breeds   Concealed in ruins, moss, and weeds:   While, ever and anon, there falls   Huge heaps of hoary mouldered walls.
10161-8{_}1472{_}Yet time has seen, that lifts the low,   And level lays the lofty brow,   Has seen this broken pile complete,   Big with the vanity of state;   But transient is the smile of fate!
10161-8{_}1473{_}A little rule, a little sway,   A sunbeam in a winter's day,   Is all the proud and mighty have   Between the cradle and the grave.
10161-8{_}1474{_}And see the rivers how they run,   Through woods and meads, in shade and sun,   Sometimes swift, sometimes slow,   Wave succeeding wave, they go   A various journey to the deep,   Like human life to endless sleep!
10161-8{_}1475{_}Thus is nature's vesture wrought,   To instruct our wandering thought;   Thus she dresses green and gay,   To disperse our cares away.
10161-8{_}1476{_}Ever charming, ever new,   When will the landscape tire the view!
10161-8{_}1477{_}The fountain's fall, the river's flow,   The woody valleys warm and low;   The windy summit, wild and high,   Roughly rushing on the sky;   The pleasant seat, the ruined tower,   The naked rock, the shady bower;    The town and village, dome and farm,   Each gives each a double charm,   As pearls upon an Aethiop's arm.
10161-8{_}1478{_}See, on the mountain's southern side,   Where the prospect opens wide,   Where the evening gilds the tide;   How close and small the hedges lie!
10161-8{_}1479{_}What streaks of meadows cross the eye!
10161-8{_}1480{_}A step methinks may pass the stream,   So little distant dangers seem;   So we mistake the future's face,   Eyed through Hope's deluding glass;   As yon summits soft and fair   Clad in colours of the air,   Which to those who journey near,   Barren, brown, and rough appear;   Still we tread the same coarse way;   The present's still a cloudy day.
10161-8{_}1481{_}O may I with myself agree,   And never covet what I see:   Content me with an humble shade,   My passions tamed, my wishes laid;   For while our wishes wildly roll,   We banish quiet from the soul:   'Tis thus the busy beat the air;   And misers gather wealth and care.
10161-8{_}1482{_}Now, even now, my joys run high,   As on the mountain-turf I lie;   While the wanton Zephyr sings,   And in the vale perfumes his wings;   While the waters murmur deep;   While the shepherd charms his sheep;   While the birds unbounded fly,   And with music fill the sky,   Now, even now, my joys, run high.
10161-8{_}1483{_}Be full, ye courts, be great who will;   Search for Peace with all your skill:   Open wide the lofty door,   Seek her on the marble floor,   In vain ye search, she is not there;   In vain ye search the domes of Care!
10161-8{_}1484{_}Grass and flowers Quiet treads,   On the meads, and mountain-heads,   Along with Pleasure, close allied,   Ever by each other's side:   And often, by the murmuring rill,   Hears the thrush, while all is still,   Within the groves of Grongar Hill.
10161-8{_}1485{_}GEORGE BERKELEY     VERSES ON THE PROSPECT OF PLANTING   ARTS AND LEARNING IN AMERICA    The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime   Barren of every glorious theme,   In distant lands now waits a better time,   Producing subjects worthy fame:    In happy climes where from the genial sun   And virgin earth such scenes ensue,   The force of art in nature seems outdone,   And fancied beauties by the true:    In happy climes, the seat of innocence,   Where nature guides and virtue rules,   Where men shall not impose for truth and sense   The pedantry of courts and schools.

10161-8{_}1489{_}JAMES THOMSON     THE SEASONS    FROM WINTER    [HARDSHIPS AND BENEVOLENCE]    The keener tempests come; and, fuming dun   From all the livid east or piercing north,   Thick clouds ascend, in whose capacious womb   A vapoury deluge lies, to snow congealed.
10161-8{_}1490{_}Heavy they roll their fleecy world along,   And the sky saddens with the gathered storm.
10161-8{_}1491{_}Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,   At first thin wavering, till at last the flakes   Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day   With a continual flow.
10161-8{_}1492{_}The cherished fields   Put on their winter robe of purest white;   'Tis brightness all, save where the new snow melts   Along the mazy current; low the woods   Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun   Faint from the west emits his evening ray,   Earth's universal face, deep-hid and chill,   Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide   The works of man.
10161-8{_}1493{_}Drooping, the labourer-ox   Stands covered o'er with snow, and then demands   The fruit of all his toil.
10161-8{_}1494{_}The fowls of heaven,   Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around   The winnowing store, and claim the little boon   Which Providence assigns them.
10161-8{_}1495{_}One alone,   The redbreast, sacred to the household gods,   Wisely regardful of th' embroiling sky,   In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves    His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man   His annual visit: half-afraid, he first   Against the window beats; then brisk alights   On the warm hearth; then, hopping o'er the floor,   Eyes all the smiling family askance,   And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is,   Till, more familiar grown, the table-crumbs   Attract his slender feet.
10161-8{_}1496{_}The foodless wilds   Pour forth their brown inhabitants.
10161-8{_}1497{_}The hare,   Though timorous of heart and hard beset   By death in various forms--dark snares, and dogs,   And more unpitying men,--the garden seeks,   Urged on by fearless want.
10161-8{_}1498{_}The bleating kind   Eye the black heaven, and next the glistening earth,   With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed,   Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow.
10161-8{_}1499{_}Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind:   Baffle the raging year, and fill their pens   With food at will; lodge them below the storm,   And watch them strict, for from the bellowing east,   In this dire season, oft the whirlwind's wing   Sweeps up the burthen of whole wintry plains   At one wide waft, and o'er the hapless flocks,   Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills,   The billowy tempest whelms, till, upward urged,   The valley to a shining mountain swells,   Tipped with a wreath high-curling in the sky.
10161-8{_}1500{_}As thus the snows arise, and foul and fierce   All Winter drives along the darkened air,   In his own loose-revolving fields the swain   Disastered stands; sees other hills ascend,   Of unknown, joyless brow, and other scenes,   Of horrid prospect, shag the trackless plain;   Nor finds the river nor the forest, hid   Beneath the formless wild, but wanders on   From hill to dale, still more and more astray,   Impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps,   Stung with the thoughts of home.
10161-8{_}1501{_}The thoughts of home   Rush on his nerves, and call their vigour forth   In many a vain attempt.
10161-8{_}1502{_}How sinks his soul,   What black despair, what horror fills his heart,   When, for the dusky spot which fancy feigned    His tufted cottage rising through the snow,   He meets the roughness of the middle waste,   Far from the track and blest abode of man,   While round him night resistless closes fast,   And every tempest, howling o'er his head,   Renders the savage wilderness more wild!
10161-8{_}1503{_}Then throng the busy shapes into his mind   Of covered pits unfathomably deep   (A dire descent!
10161-8{_}1504{_}), beyond the power of frost;   Of faithless bogs; of precipices huge,   Smoothed up with snow; and--what is land unknown,   What water--of the still unfrozen spring,   In the loose marsh or solitary lake,   Where the fresh fountain from the bottom boils.
10161-8{_}1505{_}These check his fearful steps; and down he sinks   Beneath the shelter of the shapeless drift,   Thinking o'er all the bitterness of death,   Mixed with the tender anguish nature shoots   Through the wrung bosom of the dying man--   His wife, his children, and his friends unseen.
10161-8{_}1506{_}In vain for him th' officious wife prepares   The fire fair-blazing and the vestment warm;   In vain his little children, peeping out   Into the mingling storm, demand their sire,   With tears of artless innocence.
10161-8{_}1507{_}Alas!
10161-8{_}1508{_}Nor wife nor children more shall he behold,   Nor friends nor sacred home: on every nerve   The deadly Winter seizes, shuts up sense,   And, o'er his inmost vitals creeping cold,   Lays him along the snows a stiffened corse,   Stretched out and bleaching in the northern blast.
10161-8{_}1509{_}Ah, little think the gay licentious proud   Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround;   They who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth   And wanton, often cruel, riot waste;   Ah, little think they, while they dance along,   How many feel, this very moment, death   And all the sad variety of pain:   How many sink in the devouring flood,   Or more devouring flame; how many bleed,   By shameful variance betwixt man and man;   How many pine in want, and dungeon glooms,    Shut from the common air, and common use   Of their own limbs; how many drink the cup   Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread   Of misery; sore pierced by wintry winds,   How many shrink into the sordid hut   Of cheerless poverty; how many shake   With all the fiercer tortures of the mind,   Unbounded passion, madness, guilt, remorse;   Whence tumbled headlong from the height of life,   They furnish matter for the tragic Muse;   Even in the vale, where wisdom loves to dwell,   With friendship, peace, and contemplation joined,   How many, racked with honest passions, droop   In deep retired distress; how many stand   Around the deathbed of their dearest friends,   And point the parting anguish.
10161-8{_}1510{_}Thought fond man   Of these, and all the thousand nameless ills,   That one incessant struggle render life,   One scene of toil, of suffering, and of fate,   Vice in his high career would stand appalled,   And heedless rambling impulse learn to think;   The conscious heart of charity would warm,   And her wide wish benevolence dilate;   The social tear would rise, the social sigh;   And into clear perfection, gradual bliss,   Refining still, the social passions work.
10161-8{_}1511{_}From SUMMER    (LIFE'S MEANING TO THE GENEROUS MIND)    Forever running an enchanted round,   Passes the day, deceitful vain and void,   As fleets the vision o'er the formful brain,   This moment hurrying wild th' impassioned soul,   The nest in nothing lost.
10161-8{_}1512{_}'Tis so to him,   The dreamer of this earth, an idle blank;   A sight of horror to the cruel wretch,   Who all day long in sordid pleasure rolled,   Himself an useless load, has squandered vile,   Upon his scoundrel train, what might have cheered   A drooping family of modest worth.
10161-8{_}1513{_}But to the generous still-improving mind,   That gives the hopeless heart to sing for joy,   Diffusing kind beneficence around,   Boastless,--as now descends the silent dew,--   To him the long review of ordered life   Is inward rapture, only to be felt.
10161-8{_}1514{_}FROM SPRING    [THE DIVINE FORCE IN SPRING]    Come, gentle Spring, ethereal mildness, come!
10161-8{_}1515{_}And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud,   While music wakes around, veiled in a shower   Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend!
10161-8{_}1516{_}O Hertford, fitted or to shine in courts   With unaffected grace, or walk the plain   With Innocence and Meditation joined   In soft assemblage, listen to my song,   Which thy own season paints, when nature all   Is blooming and benevolent, like thee.
10161-8{_}1517{_}And see where surly Winter passes off,   Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts:   His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill,   The shattered forest, and the ravaged vale;   While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch--   Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost--   The mountains lift their green heads to the sky.
10161-8{_}1518{_}As yet the trembling year is unconfirmed,   And Winter oft at eve resumes the breeze,   Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets   Deform the day delightless; so that scarce   The bittern knows his time, with bill engulfed,   To shake the sounding marsh, or from the shore   The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath   And sing their wild notes to the listening waste.
10161-8{_}1519{_}At last from Aries rolls the bounteous sun,   And the bright Bull receives him.
10161-8{_}1520{_}Then no more   Th' expansive atmosphere is cramped with cold,   But, full of life and vivifying soul,   Lifts the light clouds sublime and spreads them thin,   Fleecy and white, o'er all-surrounding heaven;    Forth fly the tepid airs, and, unconfined,   Unbinding earth, the moving softness strays.
10161-8{_}1521{_}Joyous, th' impatient husbandman perceives   Relenting nature, and his lusty steers   Drives from their stalls, to where the well-used plough   Lies in the furrow, loosened from the frost;   There, unrefusing, to the harnessed yoke   They lend their shoulder, and begin their toil,   Cheered by the simple song and soaring lark;   Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining share   The master leans, removes th' obstructing clay,   Winds the whole work, and sidelong lays the glebe.
10161-8{_}1522{_}White through the neighbouring fields the sower stalks,   With measured step, and liberal throws the grain   Into the faithful bosom of the ground;   The harrow follows harsh, and shuts the scene.
10161-8{_}1523{_}Be gracious, Heaven!
10161-8{_}1524{_}for now laborious man   Has done his part.
10161-8{_}1525{_}Ye fostering breezes, blow!
10161-8{_}1526{_}Ye softening dews, ye tender showers, descend!
10161-8{_}1527{_}And temper all, thou world-reviving sun,   Into the perfect year!
10161-8{_}1528{_}Nor ye who live   In luxury and ease, in pomp and pride,   Think these lost themes unworthy of your ear.
10161-8{_}1529{_}Such themes as these the rural Maro sung   To wide-imperial Rome, in the full height   Of elegance and taste, by Greece refined.
10161-8{_}1530{_}In ancient times, the sacred plough employed   The kings and awful fathers of mankind;   And some, with whom compared your insect tribes   Are but the beings of a summer's day,   Have held the scale of empire, ruled the storm   Of mighty war, then with victorious hand,   Disdaining little delicacies, seized   The plough, and, greatly independent, scorned   All the vile stores corruption can bestow.
10161-8{_}1531{_}Ye generous Britons, venerate the plough;   And o'er your hills and long-withdrawing vales   Let Autumn spread his treasures to the sun,   Luxuriant and unbounded!
10161-8{_}1532{_}As the sea,   Far through his azure, turbulent domain,   Your empire owns, and from a thousand shores   Wafts all the pomp of life into your ports,    So with superior boon may your rich soil   Exuberant, Nature's better blessings pour   O'er every land, the naked nations clothe,   And be th' exhaustless granary of a world.
10161-8{_}1533{_}Nor only through the lenient air this change,   Delicious, breathes: the penetrative sun,   His force deep-darting to the dark retreat   Of vegetation, sets the steaming power   At large, to wander o'er the verdant earth,   In various hues--but chiefly thee, gay green!
10161-8{_}1534{_}Thou smiling Nature's universal robe,   United light and shade, where the sight dwells   With growing strength and ever new delight.
10161-8{_}1535{_}From the moist meadow to the withered hill,   Led by the breeze, the vivid verdure runs,   And swells and deepens to the cherished eye.
10161-8{_}1536{_}The hawthorn whitens; and the juicy groves   Put forth their buds, unfolding by degrees,   Till the whole leafy forest stands displayed   In full luxuriance to the sighing gales,   Where the deer rustle through the twining brake,   And the birds sing concealed.
10161-8{_}1537{_}At once, arrayed   In all the colours of the flushing year   By Nature's swift and secret-working hand,   The garden glows, and fills the liberal air   With lavished fragrance, while the promised fruit   Lies yet a little embryo, unperceived,   Within its crimson folds.
10161-8{_}1538{_}Now from the town,   Buried in smoke and sleep and noisome damps,   Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields,   Where freshness breathes, and dash the trembling drops   From the bent bush, as through the verdant maze   Of sweet-briar hedges I pursue my walk;   Or taste the smell of dairy; or ascend   Some eminence, Augusta, in thy plains,   And see the country, far diffused around,   One boundless blush, one white-empurpled shower   Of mingled blossoms, where the raptured eye   Hurries from joy to joy, and, hid beneath   The fair profusion, yellow Autumn spies.
10161-8{_}1539{_}*       *       *       *       *    What is this mighty breath, ye sages, say,   That in a powerful language, felt not heard,   Instructs the fowl of heaven, and through their breast   These arts of love diffuses?
10161-8{_}1540{_}What but God?
10161-8{_}1541{_}Inspiring God!
10161-8{_}1542{_}who boundless spirit all,   And unremitting energy, pervades,   Adjusts, sustains, and agitates the whole.
10161-8{_}1543{_}He ceaseless works alone, and yet alone   Seems not to work; with such perfection framed   Is this complex, stupendous scheme of things.
10161-8{_}1544{_}But, though concealed, to every purer eye   Th' informing author in his works appears:   Chief, lovely Spring, in thee, and thy soft scenes,   The smiling God is seen; while water, earth,   And air attest his bounty; which exalts   The brute creation to this finer thought,   And annual melts their undesigning hearts   Profusely thus in tenderness and joy,    Still let my song a nobler note assume,   And sing th' infusive force of Spring on man,   When heaven and earth, as if contending, vie   To raise his being, and serene his soul.
10161-8{_}1545{_}Can he forbear to join the general smile   Of nature?
10161-8{_}1546{_}Can fierce passions vex his breast,   While every gale is peace, and every grove   Is melody?
10161-8{_}1547{_}Hence from the bounteous walks   Of flowing Spring, ye sordid sons of earth,   Hard, and unfeeling of another's woe;   Or only lavish to yourselves; away!
10161-8{_}1548{_}But come, ye generous minds, la whose wide thought,   Of all his works, creative bounty burns   With warmest beam!
10161-8{_}1549{_}FROM AUTUMN    [THE PLEASING SADNESS OF THE DECLINING YEAR]    But see!
10161-8{_}1550{_}the fading many-coloured woods,   Shade deepening over shade, the country round   Imbrown, a crowded umbrage, dusk and dun,    Of every hue from wan declining green   To sooty dark.
10161-8{_}1551{_}These now the lonesome Muse,   Low-whispering, lead into their leaf-strown walks,   And give the season in its latest view.
10161-8{_}1552{_}Meantime, light-shadowing all, a sober calm   Fleeces unbounded ether, whose least wave   Stands tremulous, uncertain where to turn   The gentle current, while, illumined wide,   The dewy-skirted clouds imbibe the sun,   And through their lucid veil his softened force   Shed o'er the peaceful world.
10161-8{_}1553{_}Then is the time,   For those whom wisdom and whom nature charm,   To steal themselves from the degenerate crowd,   And soar above this little scene of things,   To tread low-thoughted Vice beneath their feet,   To soothe the throbbing passions into peace,   And woo lone Quiet in her silent walks.
10161-8{_}1554{_}Thus solitary, and in pensive guise,   Oft let me wander o'er the russet mead   And through the saddened grove, where scarce is heard   One dying strain to cheer the woodman's toil.
10161-8{_}1555{_}Haply some widowed songster pours his plaint,   Far, in faint warblings, through the tawny copse;   While congregated thrushes, linnets, larks,   And each wild throat whose artless strains so late   Swelled all the music of the swarming shades,   Robbed of their tuneful souls, now shivering sit   On the dead tree, a dull despondent flock,   With not a brightness waving o'er their plumes,   And naught save chattering discord in their note.
10161-8{_}1556{_}Oh, let not, aimed from some inhuman eye,   The gun the music of the coming year   Destroy, and harmless, unsuspecting harm,   Lay the weak tribes a miserable prey,   In mingled murder fluttering on the ground!
10161-8{_}1557{_}The pale descending year, yet pleasing still,   A gentler mood inspires: for now the leaf   Incessant rustles from the mournful grove,   Oft startling such as, studious, walk below,   And slowly circles through the waving air;   But should a quicker breeze amid the boughs    Sob, o'er the sky the leafy deluge streams,   Till, choked and matted with the dreary shower,   The forest walks, at every rising gale,   Roll wide the withered waste and whistle bleak.
10161-8{_}1558{_}Fled is the blasted verdure of the fields,   And, shrunk into their beds, the flowery race   Their sunny robes resign; even what remained   Of stronger fruits fall from the naked tree;   And woods, fields, gardens, orchards, all around,   The desolated, prospect thrills the soul.
10161-8{_}1559{_}A HYMN    (CONCLUDING THE SEASONS)    These, as they change, Almighty Father, these,   Are but the varied God.
10161-8{_}1560{_}The rolling year   Is full of Thee.
10161-8{_}1561{_}Forth In the pleasing Spring   Thy beauty walks, thy tenderness and love.
10161-8{_}1562{_}Wide-flush the fields; the softening air is balm;   Echo the mountains round; the forest smiles;   And every sense, and every heart is joy.
10161-8{_}1563{_}Then comes thy glory in the summer-months,   With light and heat refulgent.
10161-8{_}1564{_}Then thy sun   Shoots full perfection through the swelling year:   And oft thy voice in dreadful thunder speaks;   And oft at dawn, deep noon, or falling eve,   By brooks and groves, in hollow-whispering gales.
10161-8{_}1565{_}Thy bounty shines in autumn unconfined,   And spreads a common feast for all that lives.
10161-8{_}1566{_}In winter awful thou' with clouds and storms   Around thee thrown, tempest o'er tempest rolled   Majestic darkness!
10161-8{_}1567{_}on the whirlwind's wing,   Riding sublime, thou bidst the world adore,   And humblest nature with thy northern blast.
10161-8{_}1568{_}Mysterious round!

10161-8{_}1570{_}a simple train,   Yet so delightful mixed, with such kind art,   Such beauty and beneficence combined:   Shade, unperceived, so softening into shade;   And all so forming an harmonious whole;    That, as they still succeed, they ravish still.
10161-8{_}1571{_}But wandering oft, with brute unconscious gaze,   Man marks not Thee, marks not the mighty hand;   That, ever-busy, wheels the silent spheres;   Works in the secret deep; shoots, steaming, thence   The fair profusion that o'erspreads the spring:   Flings from the sun direct the flaming day;   Feeds every creature; hurls the tempest forth;   And, as on earth this grateful change revolves,   With transport touches all the springs of life.
10161-8{_}1572{_}Nature, attend!
10161-8{_}1573{_}join every living soul,   Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,   In adoration join; and ardent raise   One general song!

10161-8{_}1608{_}From THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE    O mortal man, who livest here by toil,   Do not complain of this thy hard estate:   That like an emmet thou must ever moil   Is a sad sentence of an ancient date;   And, certes, there is for it reason great,   For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail   And curse thy star, and early drudge and late,   Withouten that would come an heavier bale--   Loose life, unruly passions, and diseases pale.
10161-8{_}1609{_}In lowly dale, fast by a river's side,   With woody hill o'er hill encompassed round,   A most enchanting wizard did abide,   Than whom, a fiend more fell is nowhere found.
10161-8{_}1610{_}It was, I ween, a lovely spot of ground;   And there a season atween June and May,   Half prankt with spring, with summer half imbrowned,   A listless climate made, where, sooth to say,   No living wight could work, ne carèd even for play.
10161-8{_}1611{_}Was naught around but images of rest:   Sleep-soothing groves, and quiet lawns between;   And flowery beds that slumbrous influence kest,   From poppies breathed; and beds of pleasant green,   Where never yet was creeping creature seen.
10161-8{_}1612{_}Meantime unnumbered glittering streamlets played,   And hurlèd everywhere their waters sheen,   That, as they bickered through the sunny glade,   Though restless still themselves, a lulling murmur made.
10161-8{_}1613{_}Joined to the prattle of the purling rills,   Were heard the lowing herds along the vale,   And flocks loud-bleating from the distant hills,   And vacant shepherds piping in the dale;   And now and then sweet Philomel would wail,   Or stock doves 'plain amid the forest deep,   That drowsy rustled to the sighing gale;   And still a coil the grasshopper did keep:   Yet all these sounds, yblent, inclinèd all to sleep.
10161-8{_}1614{_}Pull in the passage of the vale, above,   A sable, silent, solemn forest stood,   Where naught but shadowy forms was seen to move,   As Idless fancied in her dreaming mood;   And up the hills, on either side, a wood   Of blackening pines, aye waving to and fro,   Sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood;   And where this valley winded out, below,   The murmuring main was heard, and scarcely heard, to flow.
10161-8{_}1615{_}A pleasing land of drowsyhed it was:   Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;   And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,   Forever flushing round a summer sky.
10161-8{_}1616{_}There eke the soft delights, that witchingly   Instil a wanton sweetness through the breast,   And the calm pleasures, always hovered nigh;   But whate'er smacked of 'noyance or unrest   Was far, far off expelled from this delicious nest.
10161-8{_}1617{_}The landskip such, inspiring perfect ease,   Where Indolence (for so the wizard hight)   Close-hid his castle mid embowering trees,   That half shut out the beams of Phoebus bright,   And made a kind of checkered day and night.
10161-8{_}1618{_}Meanwhile, unceasing at the massy gate,   Beneath a spacious palm, the wicked wight   Was placed; and, to his lute, of cruel fate   And labour harsh complained, lamenting man's estate.
10161-8{_}1619{_}Thither continual pilgrims crowded still,   From all the roads of earth that pass there by;   For, as they chaunced to breathe on neighbouring hill,   The freshness of this valley smote their eye,   And drew them ever and anon more nigh,   Till clustering round th' enchanter false they hung,   Ymolten with his syren melody.
10161-8{_}1620{_}While o'er th' enfeebling lute his hand he flung,   And to the trembling chords these tempting verses sung:    'Behold, ye pilgrims of this earth, behold!
10161-8{_}1621{_}See all but man with unearned pleasure gay!

10161-8{_}1633{_}To noontide shades incontinent he ran,   Where purls the brook with sleep-inviting sound,   Or when Dan Sol to slope his wheels began,   Amid the broom he basked him on the ground,   Where the wild thyme and camomil are found;   There would he linger, till the latest ray   Of light sate trembling on the welkin's bound,   Then homeward through the twilight shadows stray,   Sauntering and slow: so had he passed many a day.
10161-8{_}1634{_}Yet not in thoughtless slumber were they passed;   For oft the heavenly fire, that lay concealed   Beneath the sleeping embers, mounted fast,   And all its native light anew revealed;   Oft as he traversed the cerulean field,   And marked the clouds that drove before the wind,   Ten thousand glorious systems would he build,   Ten thousand great ideas filled his mind:   But with the clouds they fled, and left no trace behind.

10161-8{_}1747{_}How little known!
10161-8{_}1748{_}Small knowledge we dig up with endless toil;   And love unfeigned may purchase perfect hate.
10161-8{_}1749{_}Why starved on earth our angel appetites,   While brutal are indulged their fulsome fill?

10161-8{_}1752{_}And shuts   Eternity the door on our complaint?
10161-8{_}1753{_}If so, for what strange ends were mortals made!
10161-8{_}1754{_}The worst to wallow, and the best to weep;   The man who merits most, must most complain:   Can we conceive a disregard in Heaven   What the worst perpetrate or best endure?
10161-8{_}1755{_}This cannot be.
10161-8{_}1756{_}To love, and know, in man   Is boundless appetite, and boundless power:   And these demonstrate boundless objects, too.

10161-8{_}1758{_}Is man the sole exception from her laws?
10161-8{_}1759{_}Eternity struck off from human hope,   (I speak with truth, but veneration too)   Man is a monster, the reproach of Heaven,   A stain, a dark impenetrable cloud   On Nature's beauteous aspect; and deforms   (Amazing blot!)

10161-8{_}1764{_}go, man!
10161-8{_}1765{_}And bow to thy superiors of the stall;    Through every scene of sense superior far:   They graze the turf untilled; they drink the stream   Unbrewed, and ever full, and unembittered   With doubts, fears, fruitless hopes, regrets, despair.
10161-8{_}1766{_}Mankind's peculiar!
10161-8{_}1767{_}reason's precious dower!
10161-8{_}1768{_}No foreign clime they ransack for their robes,   No brother cite to the litigious bar.
10161-8{_}1769{_}Their good is good entire, unmixed, unmarred;   They find a paradise in every field,   On boughs forbidden, where no curses hang:   Their ill no more than strikes the sense, unstretched   By previous dread or murmur in the rear;   When the worst comes, it comes unfeared; one stroke   Begins and ends their woe: they die but once;   Blessed incommunicable privilege!
10161-8{_}1770{_}for which   Proud man, who rules the globe and reads the stars,   Philosopher or hero, sighs in vain.
10161-8{_}1771{_}Account for this prerogative in brutes:   No day, no glimpse of day, to solve the knot   But what beams on it from eternity.
10161-8{_}1772{_}O sole and sweet solution!
10161-8{_}1773{_}that unties   The difficult, and softens the severe;   The cloud on Nature's beauteous face dispels,   Restores bright order, easts the brute beneath,   And re-enthrones us in supremacy   Of joy, e'en here.
10161-8{_}1774{_}Admit immortal life,   And virtue is knight-errantry no more:   Each virtue brings in hand a golden dower   Far richer in reversion: Hope exults,   And, though much bitter in our cup is thrown,   Predominates and gives the taste of Heaven.

10161-8{_}1798{_}But quick they back recoil, and wisely check   Their eager haste; then o'er the fallowed ground   How leisurely they work, and many a pause   Th' harmonious concert breaks; till more assured   With joy redoubled the low valleys ring.

10161-8{_}1803{_}The withered grass that clings   Around her head of the same russet hue   Almost deceived my sight, had not her eyes   With life full-beaming her vain wiles betrayed.

10161-8{_}1811{_}Now, my brave youths,   Stripped for the chase, give all your souls to joy!
10161-8{_}1812{_}See how their coursers, than the mountain roe   More fleet, the verdant carpet skim; thick clouds   Snorting they breathe; their shining hoofs scarce print   The grass unbruised; when emulation fired,   They strain, to lead the field, top the barred gate,   O'er the deep ditch exulting bound, and brush   The thorny-twining hedge; the riders bend   O'er their arched necks; with steady hands, by turns   Indulge their speed, or moderate their rage.
10161-8{_}1813{_}Where are their sorrows, disappointments, wrongs,   Vexations, sickness, cares?

10161-8{_}1832{_}PROLOGUE TO 'GUSTAVUS VASA'    Britons!
10161-8{_}1833{_}this night presents a state distressed:   Though brave, yet vanquished; and though great, oppressed.
10161-8{_}1834{_}Vice, ravening vulture, on her vitals preyed;   Her peers, her prelates, fell corruption swayed:   Their rights, for power, the ambitious weakly sold:   The wealthy, poorly, for superfluous gold,   Hence wasting ills, hence severing factions rose,   And gave large entrance to invading foes:   Truth, justice, honour, fled th' infected shore;   For freedom, sacred freedom, was no more.
10161-8{_}1835{_}Then, greatly rising in his country's right,   Her hero, her deliverer sprung to light:   A race of hardy northern sons he led,   Guiltless of courts, untainted and unread;   Whose inborn spirit spurned the ignoble fee,   Whose hands scorned bondage, for their hearts were free.
10161-8{_}1836{_}Ask ye what law their conquering cause confessed?--   Great Nature's law, the law within the breast:   Formed by no art, and to no sect confined,   But stamped by Heaven upon th' unlettered mind.
10161-8{_}1837{_}Such, such of old, the first born natives were   Who breathed the virtues of Britannia's air,   Their realm when mighty Caesar vainly sought,   For mightier freedom against Caesar fought,   And rudely drove the famed invader home,   To tyrannize o'er polished--venal Rome.
10161-8{_}1838{_}Our bard, exalted in a freeborn flame,   To every nation would transfer this claim:   He to no state, no climate, bounds his page,   But bids the moral beam through every age.
10161-8{_}1839{_}Then be your judgment generous as his plan;   Ye sons of freedom!
10161-8{_}1840{_}save the friend of man.

10161-8{_}1842{_}I see it wide beneath the arch of heaven,   When the stars peep upon their evening hour,   And the moon rises on the eastern wave,   Housed in a cloud of gold!
10161-8{_}1843{_}I see it wide   In earth's autumnal taints of various landscape   When the first ray of morning tips the trees,   And fires the distant rock!
10161-8{_}1844{_}I hear its voice   When thy hand sends the sound along the gale,   Swept from the silver strings or on mine ear   Drops the sweet sadness!
10161-8{_}1845{_}At my heart I feel   Its potent grasp, I melt beneath the touch,   When the tale pours upon my sense humane   The woes of other times!
10161-8{_}1846{_}What art thou, Beauty?
10161-8{_}1847{_}Thou art not colour, fancy, sound, nor form--   These but the conduits are, whence the soul quaffs   The liquor of its heaven.

10161-8{_}1884{_}JONATHAN SWIFT     FROM THE BEASTS' CONFESSION    When beasts could speak, (the learned say   They still can do so every day,)   It seems they had religion then,   As much as now we find in men.
10161-8{_}1885{_}It happened, when a plague broke out,   (Which therefore made them more devout,)   The king of brutes (to make it plain,   Of quadrupeds I only mean)   By proclamation gave command   That every subject in the land   Should to the priest confess their sins;   And thus the pious Wolf begins:--   'Good father, I must own with shame,   That often I have been to blame:   I must confess, on Friday last,   Wretch that I was!
10161-8{_}1886{_}I broke my fast:   But I defy the basest tongue   To prove I did my neighbour wrong;   Or ever went to seek my food,   By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood.'
10161-8{_}1887{_}The Ass approaching next, confessed   That in his heart he loved a jest:   A wag he was, he needs must own,   And could not let a dunce alone:    Sometimes his friend he would not spare,   And might perhaps be too severe:   But yet the worst that could be said,   He was a wit both born and bred;   And, if it be a sin and shame,   Nature alone must bear the blame:   One fault he has, is sorry for't,   His ears are half a foot too short;   Which could he to the standard bring,   He'd show his face before the king:   Then for his voice, there's none disputes   That he's the nightingale of brutes.
10161-8{_}1888{_}The Swine with contrite heart allowed   His shape and beauty made him proud:   In diet was perhaps too nice,   But gluttony was ne'er his vice:   In every turn of life content,   And meekly took what fortune sent;   Inquire through all the parish round,   A better neighbour ne'er was found;   His vigilance might some displease;   'Tis true, he hated sloth like pease.
10161-8{_}1889{_}The mimic Ape began his chatter,   How evil tongues his life bespatter;   Much of the censuring world complained,   Who said, his gravity was feigned:   Indeed, the strictness of his morals   Engaged him in a hundred quarrels:   He saw, and he was grieved to see 't,   His zeal was sometimes indiscreet:   He found his virtues too severe   For our corrupted times to bear;   Yet such a lewd licentious age   Might well excuse a stoic's rage.
10161-8{_}1890{_}The Goat advanced with decent pace,   And first excused his youthful face;   Forgiveness begged that he appeared   ('Twas Nature's fault) without a beard.
10161-8{_}1891{_}'Tis true, he was not much inclined   To fondness for the female kind:   Not, as his enemies object,   From chance, or natural defect;    Not by his frigid constitution;   But through a pious resolution:   For he had made a holy vow   Of chastity, as monks do now:   Which he resolved to keep for ever hence   And strictly too, as doth his reverence.
10161-8{_}1892{_}Apply the tale, and you shall find,   How just it suits with human kind.
10161-8{_}1893{_}Some faults we own; but can you guess?
10161-8{_}1894{_}--Why, virtues carried to excess,   Wherewith our vanity endows us,   Though neither foe nor friend allows us.
10161-8{_}1895{_}The Lawyer swears (you may rely on't)   He never squeezed a needy client;   And this he makes his constant rule,   For which his brethren call him fool;   His conscience always was so nice,   He freely gave the poor advice;   By which he lost, he may affirm,   A hundred fees last Easter term;   While others of the learned robe,   Would break the patience of a Job.
10161-8{_}1896{_}No pleader at the bar could match   His diligence and quick dispatch;   Ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast,   Above a term or two at most.
10161-8{_}1897{_}The cringing Knave, who seeks a place   Without success, thus tells his case:   Why should he longer mince the matter?
10161-8{_}1898{_}He failed, because he could not flatter;   He had not learned to turn his coat,   Nor for a party give his vote:   His crime he quickly understood;   Too zealous for the nation's good:   He found the ministers resent it,   Yet could not for his heart repent it.
10161-8{_}1899{_}The Chaplain vows, he cannot fawn,   Though it would raise him to the lawn:   He passed his hours among his books;   You find it in his meagre looks:   He might, if he were worldly wise,   Preferment get, and spare his eyes;   But owns he had a stubborn spirit,   That made him trust alone to merit;   Would rise by merit to promotion;   Alas!

10161-8{_}1903{_}He cannot help it, for his heart,   Sometimes to act the parson's part:   Quotes from the Bible many a sentence,   That moves his patients to repentance;   And, when his medicines do no good,   Supports their minds with heavenly food:   At which, however well intended.
10161-8{_}1904{_}He hears the clergy are offended;   And grown so bold behind his back,   To call him hypocrite and quack.

10161-8{_}1908{_}The Ass was never known so stupid   To act the part of Tray or Cupid;   Nor leaps upon his master's lap.
10161-8{_}1909{_}There to be stroked, and fed with pap,   As Aesop would the world persuade;   He better understands his trade:   Nor comes whene'er his lady whistles,   But carries loads, and feeds on thistles.
10161-8{_}1910{_}Our author's meaning, I presume, is   A creature _bipes et implumis_;    Wherein the moralist designed   A compliment on human kind;   For here he owns, that now and then   Beasts may degenerate into men.

10161-8{_}2111{_}But if to ampler prospects, if to gaze   On Nature's form where, negligent of all   These lesser graces, she assumes the part   Of that Eternal Majesty that weighed   The world's foundations, if to these the mind   Exalts her daring eye; then mightier far   Will be the change, and nobler.
10161-8{_}2112{_}Would the forms   Of servile custom cramp her generous powers?

10161-8{_}2150{_}Then lead, calm votaress, where some sheety lake   Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile   Or upland fallows grey   Reflect its last cool gleam.

10161-8{_}2152{_}While Spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont,   And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve;   While Summer loves to sport   Beneath thy lingering light;    While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;   Or Winter, yelling through the troublous air,   Affrights thy shrinking train,   And rudely rends thy robes;    So long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed,   Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lipped Health,   Thy gentlest influence own,   And hymn, thy favourite name!
10161-8{_}2153{_}ODE ON THE POETICAL CHARACTER    STROPHE    As once---if not with light regard   I read aright that gifted bard   (Him whose school above the rest   His loveliest Elfin Queen has blest)--   One, only one, unrivalled fair   Might hope the magic girdle wear,   At solemn tourney hung on high,   The wish of each love-darting eye;   Lo!
10161-8{_}2154{_}to each other nymph in turn applied,   As if, in air unseen, some hovering hand,   Some chaste and angel friend to virgin fame,   With whispered spell had burst the starting band,    It left unblest her loathed, dishonoured side;   Happier, hopeless fair, if never   Her baffled hand, with vain endeavour,   Had touched that fatal zone to her denied!
10161-8{_}2155{_}Young Fancy thus, to me divinest name,   To whom, prepared and bathed in heaven,   The cest of amplest power is given,   To few the godlike gift assigns   To gird their blest, prophetic loins,   And gaze her visions wild, and feel unmixed her flame!
10161-8{_}2156{_}EPODE    The band, as fairy legends say,   Was wove on that creating day   When He who called with thought to birth   Yon tented sky, this laughing earth,   And dressed with springs and forests tall,   And poured the main engirting all,   Long by the loved enthusiast wood,   Himself in some diviner mood,   Retiring, sate with her alone,   And placed her on his sapphire throne,   The whiles, the vaulted shrine around,   Seraphic wires were heard to sound,   Now sublimest triumph swelling,   Now on love and mercy dwelling;   And she, from out the veiling cloud,   Breathed her magic notes aloud,   And thou, thou rich-haired Youth of Morn,   And all thy subject life, was born!
10161-8{_}2157{_}The dangerous passions kept aloof,   Far from the sainted growing woof:   But near it sate ecstatic Wonder,   Listening the deep applauding thunder;   And Truth, in sunny vest arrayed,   By whose the tarsel's eyes were made;   All the shadowy tribes of mind,   In braided dance, their murmurs joined,   And all the bright uncounted powers   Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers.
10161-8{_}2158{_}Where is the bard whose soul can now   Its high presuming hopes avow?
10161-8{_}2159{_}Where he who thinks, with rapture blind,   This hallowed work for him designed?
10161-8{_}2160{_}ANTISTROPHE    High on some cliff, to heaven up-piled,   Of rude access, of prospect wild,   Where, tangled round the jealous steep,   Strange shades o'erbrow the valleys deep.
10161-8{_}2161{_}And holy genii guard the rock,   Its glooms embrown, its springs unlock,   While on its rich ambitious head   An Eden, like his own, lies spread,    I view that oak, the fancied glades among,   By which as Milton lay, his evening ear,   From many a cloud that dropped ethereal dew,   Nigh sphered in heaven, its native strains could hear,   On which that ancient trump he reached was hung:   Thither oft, his glory greeting,   From Waller's myrtle shades retreating,   With many a vow from Hope's aspiring tongue,   My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue;   In vain--such bliss to one alone   Of all the sons of soul was known,   And Heaven and Fancy, kindred powers,   Have now o'erturned th' inspiring bowers,   Or curtained close such scene from every future view.
10161-8{_}2162{_}THE PASSIONS    AN ODE FOR MUSIC    When Music, heavenly maid, was young,   While yet in early Greece she sung,   The Passions oft, to hear her shell,   Thronged around her magic cell,   Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,   Possessed beyond the Muse's painting;   By turns they felt the glowing mind   Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined:    Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired,   Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,   From the supporting myrtles round   They snatched her instruments of sound;   And, as they oft had heard apart   Sweet lessons of her forceful art,   Each (for madness ruled the hour)   Would prove his own expressive power.
10161-8{_}2163{_}First Fear in hand, its skill to try,   Amid the chords bewildered laid,   And back recoiled, he knew not why,   Even at the sound himself had made.
10161-8{_}2164{_}Next Anger rushed: his eyes, on fire,   In lightnings owned his secret stings;   In one rude clash he struck the lyre,   And swept with hurried hand the strings.
10161-8{_}2165{_}With woeful measures wan Despair   Low, sullen sounds his grief beguiled;   A solemn, strange, and mingled air--   'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.
10161-8{_}2166{_}But thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair,   What was thy delightful measure?
10161-8{_}2167{_}Still it whispered promised pleasure,   And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!
10161-8{_}2168{_}Still would her touch the strain prolong;   And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,   She called on Echo still, through all the song;   And where her sweetest theme she chose,   A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,   And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.
10161-8{_}2169{_}And longer had she sung--but with a frown   Revenge impatient rose;   He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down,   And with a withering look   The war-denouncing trumpet took,   And blew a blast so loud and dread,   Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe.
10161-8{_}2170{_}And ever and anon he beat   The doubling drum with furious heat;   And though sometimes, each dreary pause between,   Dejected Pity, at his side,   Her soul-subduing voice applied,   Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien,   While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.
10161-8{_}2171{_}Thy numbers, Jealousy, to naught were fixed,   Sad proof of thy distressful state;   Of differing themes the veering--song was mixed,   And now It courted Love, now raving called on Hate.
10161-8{_}2172{_}With eyes upraised, as one inspired,   Pale Melancholy sate retired,   And from her wild sequestered seat,   In notes by distance made more sweet,   Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul;   And, dashing soft from rocks around,   Bubbling runnels joined the sound:   Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,   Or o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,   Round an holy calm diffusing,   Love of peace and lonely musing,   In hollow murmurs died away,    But O how altered was its sprightlier tone,   When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,   Her how across her shoulder flung,   Her buskins gemmed with morning dew,   Blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket rung,   The hunter's call, to faun and dryad known!
10161-8{_}2173{_}The oak-crowned sisters, and their chaste-eyed queen,   Satyrs, and sylvan boys, were seen,   Peeping from forth their alleys green;   Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;   And Sport leaped up, and seized his beechen spear.
10161-8{_}2174{_}Last came Joy's ecstatic trial:   He, with viny crown advancing,   First to the lively pipe his hand addressed;   But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,   Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best.
10161-8{_}2175{_}They would have thought, who heard the strain,   They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids,   Amidst the festal-sounding shades,   To some unwearied minstrel dancing,   While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,   Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round;   Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound,   And he, amidst his frolic play,   As if he would the charming air repay,   Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings.
10161-8{_}2176{_}O Music!
10161-8{_}2177{_}sphere-descended maid!

10161-8{_}2179{_}Why, goddess, why, to us denied,   Lay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside?
10161-8{_}2180{_}As in that loved Athenian bower   You learned an all-commanding power,   Thy mimic soul, O nymph endeared,   Can well recall what then it heard.
10161-8{_}2181{_}Where is thy native simple heart,   Devote to Virtue, Fancy, Art?
10161-8{_}2182{_}Arise as in that elder time,   Warm energic, chaste, sublime!

10161-8{_}2184{_}O bid our vain endeavours cease:   Revive the just designs of Greece;   Return in all thy simple state;   Confirm the tales her sons relate!

10161-8{_}2188{_}nor regardless, while these numbers boast   My short-lived bliss, forget my social name;   But think, far off, how on the Southern coast   I met thy friendship with an equal flame!
10161-8{_}2189{_}Fresh to that soil thou turn'st, whose every vale   Shall prompt the poet, and his song demand:   To thee thy copious subjects ne'er shall fail;   Thou need'st but take the pencil to thy hand,   And paint what all believe who own thy genial land.
10161-8{_}2190{_}II    There must thou wake perforce thy Doric quill;   'Tis Fancy's land to which thou sett'st thy feet,   Where still, 'tis said, the fairy people meet   Beneath each birken shade on mead or hill.
10161-8{_}2191{_}There each trim lass that skims the milky store   To the swart tribes their creamy bowl allots;   By night they sip it round the cottage door,   While airy minstrels warble jocund notes.
10161-8{_}2192{_}There every herd, by sad experience, knows   How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly;   When the sick ewe her summer food foregoes,   Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie.
10161-8{_}2193{_}Such airy beings awe th' untutored swain:   Nor thou, though learn'd, his homelier thoughts neglect;   Let thy sweet Muse the rural faith sustain:   These are the themes of simple, sure effect,   That add new conquests to her boundless reign,   And fill, with double force, her heart-commanding strain.
10161-8{_}2194{_}III    Even yet preserved, how often may'st thou hear,   Where to the pole the boreal mountains run,   Taught by the father to his listening son,   Strange lays, whose power had charmed a Spenser's ear.
10161-8{_}2195{_}At every pause, before thy mind possessed,   Old Runic bards shall seem to rise around,   With uncouth lyres, in many-coloured vest,   Their matted hair with boughs fantastic crowned:   Whether thou bid'st the well-taught hind repeat   The choral dirge that mourns some chieftain brave,   When every shrieking maid her bosom beat,   And strewed with choicest herbs his scented grave;   Or whether, sitting in the shepherd's shiel,   Thou hear'st some sounding tale of war's alarms,   When, at the bugle's call, with fire and steel,   The sturdy clans poured forth their bony swarms,   And hostile brothers met to prove each other's arms.
10161-8{_}2196{_}IV    'Tis thine to sing, how, framing hideous spells,   In Skye's lone isle the gifted wizard seer,   Lodged in the wintry cave with [Fate's fell spear;]   Or in the depth of Uist's dark forests dwells:   How they whose sight such dreary dreams engross,   With their own visions oft astonished droop,   When o'er the watery strath of quaggy moss   They see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop;   Or if in sports, or on the festive green,   Their [destined] glance some fated youth descry,   Who, now perhaps in lusty vigour seen   And rosy health, shall soon lamented die.
10161-8{_}2197{_}For them the viewless forms of air obey,   Their bidding heed, and at their beck repair.
10161-8{_}2198{_}They know what spirit brews the stormful day,   And, heartless, oft like moody madness stare   To see the phantom train their secret work prepare.

10161-8{_}2202{_}And as, of late, they joyed in Preston's fight,   Saw at sad Falkirk all their hopes near crowned,   They raved, divining, through their second sight,   Pale, red Culloden, where these hopes were drowned!
10161-8{_}2203{_}Illustrious William!
10161-8{_}2204{_}Britain's guardian name!
10161-8{_}2205{_}One William saved us from a tyrant's stroke;   He, for a sceptre, gained heroic fame;   But thou, more glorious, Slavery's chain hast broke,   To reign a private man, and bow to Freedom's yoke!
10161-8{_}2206{_}VI    These, too, thou'lt sing!
10161-8{_}2207{_}for well thy magic Muse   Can to the topmost heaven of grandeur soar!
10161-8{_}2208{_}Or stoop to wail the swain that is no more!
10161-8{_}2209{_}Ah, homely swains!
10161-8{_}2210{_}your homeward steps ne'er lose;   Let not dank Will mislead you to the heath:   Dancing in mirky night, o'er fen and lake,   He glows, to draw you downward to your death,   In his bewitched, low, marshy willow brake!]
10161-8{_}2211{_}What though far off, from some dark dell espied,   His glimmering mazes cheer th' excursive sight,   Yet turn, ye wanderers, turn your steps aside,   Nor trust the guidance of that faithless light;   For, watchful, lurking 'mid th' unrustling reed,   At those mirk hours the wily monster lies,   And listens oft to hear the passing steed,   And frequent round him rolls his sullen eyes,   If chance his savage wrath may some weak wretch surprise.
10161-8{_}2212{_}VII    Ah, luckless swain, o'er all unblest indeed!
10161-8{_}2213{_}Whom, late bewildered in the dank, dark fen,   Far from his flocks and smoking hamlet then,   To that sad spot [where hums the sedgy weed:]   On him, enraged, the fiend, in angry mood,   Shall never look with Pity's kind concern,   But instant, furious, raise the whelming flood   O'er its drowned bank, forbidding all return.
10161-8{_}2214{_}Or, if he meditate his wished escape   To some dim hill that seems uprising near,   To his faint eye the grim and grisly shape,   In all its terrors clad, shall wild appear.
10161-8{_}2215{_}Meantime, the watery surge shall round him rise,   Poured sudden forth from every swelling source.
10161-8{_}2216{_}What now remains but tears and hopeless sighs?
10161-8{_}2217{_}His fear-shook limbs have lost their youthly force,   And down the waves he floats, a pale and breathless corse.
10161-8{_}2218{_}VIII    For him, in vain, his anxious wife shall wait,   Or wander forth to meet him on his way;   For him, in vain, at to-fall of the day,   His babes shall linger at th' unclosing gate.
10161-8{_}2219{_}Ah, ne'er shall he return!
10161-8{_}2220{_}Alone, if night   Her travelled limbs in broken slumbers steep,   With dropping willows dressed, his mournful sprite   Shall visit sad, perchance, her silent sleep:   Then he, perhaps, with moist and watery hand,   Shall fondly seem to press her shuddering cheek,   And with his blue-swoln face before her stand,   And, shivering cold, these piteous accents speak:   'Pursue, dear wife, thy daily toils pursue   At dawn or dusk, industrious as before;   Nor e'er of me one hapless thought renew,   While I lie weltering on the oziered shore,   Drowned by the kelpie's wrath, nor e'er shall aid thee more!'
10161-8{_}2221{_}IX    Unbounded is thy range; with varied style   Thy Muse may, like those feathery tribes which spring   From their rude rocks, extend her skirting wing   Round the moist marge of each cold Hebrid isle   To that hoar pile which still its ruin shows:   In whose small vaults a pigmy-folk is found,   Whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows,   And culls them, wondering, from the hallowed ground!
10161-8{_}2222{_}Or thither, where, beneath the showery West,   The mighty kings of three fair realms are laid:   Once foes, perhaps, together now they rest;   No slaves revere them, and no wars invade:   Yet frequent now, at midnight's solemn hour,   The rifted mounds their yawning cells unfold,   And forth the monarchs stalk with sovereign power,   In pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny gold,   And on their twilight tombs aërial council hold.
10161-8{_}2223{_}X    But oh, o'er all, forget not Kilda's race,   On whose bleak rocks, which brave the wasting tides,   Fair Nature's daughter, Virtue, yet abides.
10161-8{_}2224{_}Go, just as they, their blameless manners trace!
10161-8{_}2225{_}Then to my ear transmit some gentle song   Of those whose lives are yet sincere and plain,   Their bounded walks the rugged cliffs along,   And all their prospect but the wintry main.
10161-8{_}2226{_}With sparing temperance, at the needful time,   They drain the sainted spring, or, hunger-pressed,   Along th' Atlantic rock undreading climb,   And of its eggs despoil the solan's nest.
10161-8{_}2227{_}Thus blest in primal innocence they live,   Sufficed and happy with that frugal fare   Which tasteful toil and hourly danger give.
10161-8{_}2228{_}Hard is their shallow soil, and bleak and bare;   Nor ever vernal bee was heard to murmur there!
10161-8{_}2229{_}XI    Nor need'st thou blush, that such false themes engage   Thy gentle mind, of fairer stores possessed;   For not alone they touch the village breast,   But filled in elder time th' historic page.
10161-8{_}2230{_}There Shakespeare's self, with every garland crowned,--   [Flew to those fairy climes his fancy sheen!]
10161-8{_}2231{_}--   In musing hour, his wayward Sisters found,   And with their terrors dressed the magic scene.
10161-8{_}2232{_}From them he sung, when, 'mid his bold design,   Before the Scot afflicted and aghast,   The shadowy kings of Banquo's fated line   Through the dark cave in gleamy pageant passed.

10161-8{_}2234{_}in forceful sounds and colours bold,   The native legends of thy land rehearse;   To such adapt thy lyre and suit thy powerful verse.
10161-8{_}2235{_}XII    In scenes like these, which, daring to depart   From sober truth, are still to nature true,   And call forth fresh delight to Fancy's view,   Th' heroic muse employed her Tasso's art!
10161-8{_}2236{_}How have I trembled, when, at Tancred's stroke,   Its gushing blood the gaping cypress poured;   When each live plant with mortal accents spoke,   And the wild blast upheaved the vanished sword!
10161-8{_}2237{_}How have I sat, when piped the pensive wind,   To hear his harp, by British Fairfax strung,--   Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind   Believed the magic wonders which he sung!
10161-8{_}2238{_}Hence at each sound imagination glows;   [_The MS. lacks a line here_.]
10161-8{_}2239{_}Hence his warm lay with softest sweetness flows;   Melting it flows, pure, numerous, strong, and clear,   And fills th' impassioned heart, and wins th' harmonious ear.
10161-8{_}2240{_}XIII    All hail, ye scenes that o'er my soul prevail,   Ye [splendid] friths and lakes which, far away,   Are by smooth Annan fill'd, or pastoral Tay,   Or Don's romantic springs; at distance, hail!
10161-8{_}2241{_}The time shall come when I, perhaps, may tread   Your lowly glens, o'erhung with spreading broom,   Or o'er your stretching heaths by fancy led   [Or o'er your mountains creep, in awful gloom:]   Then will I dress once more the faded bower.
10161-8{_}2242{_}Where Jonson sat in Drummond's [classic] shade,   Or crop from Teviot's dale each [lyric flower]   And mourn on Yarrow's banks [where Willy's laid!]
10161-8{_}2243{_}Meantime, ye Powers that on the plains which bore   The cordial youth, on Lothian's plains, attend,   Where'er he dwell, on hill or lowly muir,   To him I lose your kind protection lend,   And, touched with love like mine, preserve my absent friend!
10161-8{_}2244{_}THOMAS WARTON     FROM THE PLEASURES OF MELANCHOLY    Beneath yon ruined abbey's moss-grown piles   Oft let me sit, at twilight hour of eve,   Where through some western window the pale moon   Pours her long-levelled rule of streaming light,   While sullen, sacred silence reigns around,   Save the lone screech-owl's note, who builds his bower   Amid the mouldering caverns dark and damp,   Or the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves   Of flaunting ivy, that with mantle green   Invests some wasted tower.
10161-8{_}2245{_}Or let me tread   Its neighbouring walk of pines, where mused of old   The cloistered brothers: through the gloomy void   That far extends beneath their ample arch   As on I pace, religious horror wraps   My soul in dread repose.

10161-8{_}2541{_}Heavy and phlegmatic he trod the stage,   Too proud for tenderness, too dull for rage.
10161-8{_}2542{_}When Hector's lovely widow shines in tears,   Or Rowe's gay rake dependent virtue jeers,   With the same cast of features he is seen   To chide the libertine and court the queen.
10161-8{_}2543{_}From the tame scene which without passion flows,   With just desert his reputation rose.
10161-8{_}2544{_}Nor less he pleased when, on some surly plan,   He was at once the actor and the man.
10161-8{_}2545{_}In Brute he shone unequalled: all agree   Garrick's not half so great a brute as he.
10161-8{_}2546{_}When Cato's laboured scenes are brought to view,   With equal praise the actor laboured too;   For still you'll find, trace passions to their root,   Small difference 'twixt the stoic and the brute.
10161-8{_}2547{_}In fancied scenes, as in life's real plan,   He could not for a moment sink the man.
10161-8{_}2548{_}In whate'er cast his character was laid,   Self still, like oil, upon the surface played.
10161-8{_}2549{_}Nature, in spite of all his skill, crept in:   Horatio, Dorax, Falstaff--still 'twas Quin.

10161-8{_}2552{_}Our fathers met in battle, because they   loved the strife of spears.

10161-8{_}2559{_}I spared   thee in the halls of Starno, when my sword was red with   slaughter, when my eye was full of tears for the maid.
10161-8{_}2560{_}Or dost thou choose the fight?

10161-8{_}2567{_}We   have fought heretofore, O warrior, on the side of the   shaggy Malmor; after my waves had carried me to thy   halls, and the feast of a thousand shells was spread.

10161-8{_}2572{_}'Nor ship' replied the king, 'shall Fingal take, nor land   of many hills.

10161-8{_}2584{_}Thus hereafter shall he say,   and our fame shall last for ever!'
10161-8{_}2585{_}'Swaran,' said the king of hills, 'to-day our fame is   greatest.

10161-8{_}2596{_}We gave the song to the kings.
10161-8{_}2597{_}A hundred harps mixed   their sound with our voice.
10161-8{_}2598{_}The face of Swaran brightened,   like the full moon of heaven: when the clouds   vanish away, and leave her calm and broad in the midst   of the sky.

10161-8{_}2669{_}When night comes on the   hill; when the loud winds arise; my ghost shall stand in   the blast, and mourn the death of my friends.
10161-8{_}2670{_}The hunter   shall hear from his booth.

10161-8{_}2673{_}[THE LAST WORDS OF OSSIAN]    Such were the words of the bards in the days of song;   when the king heard the music of harps, the tales of other   times!

10161-8{_}2696{_}And haply, though my harsh touch, faltering still,   But mocked all tune and marred the dancer's skill,   Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,   And dance forgetful of the noontide hour.

10161-8{_}2698{_}Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,   For honour forms the social temper here:   Honour, that praise which real merit gains,   Or e'en imaginary worth obtains,   Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,   It shifts in splendid traffic round the land;   From courts to camps, to cottages it strays,   And all are taught an avarice of praise;   They pleased, are pleased; they give, to get, esteem,   Till, seeming blessed, they grow to what they seem.
10161-8{_}2699{_}But while this softer art their bliss supplies,   It gives their follies also room to rise;   For praise, too dearly loved or warmly sought,   Enfeebles all internal strength of thought,   And the weak soul, within itself unblessed,   Leans for all pleasure on another's breast.

10161-8{_}2707{_}How often have I paused on every charm,   The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,   The never-failing brook, the busy mill,   The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill,   The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade   For talking age and whispering lovers made!
10161-8{_}2708{_}How often have I blest the coming day,   When toil remitting lent its turn to play,   And all the village train, from labour free,   Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree,   While many a pastime circled in the shade,   The young contending as the old surveyed;   And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,   And sleights of art and feats of strength went round.
10161-8{_}2709{_}And still, as each repeated pleasure tired,   Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired;   The dancing pair that simply sought renown   By holding out to tire each other down;   The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,   While secret laughter tittered round the place;   The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love,   The matron's glance that would those looks reprove:   These were thy charms, sweet village!

10161-8{_}2712{_}No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,   But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;   Along the glades, a solitary guest,   The hollow sounding bittern guards its nest;   Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,   And tires their echoes with unvaried cries;   Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,   And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;   And trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,   Far, far away thy children leave the land.
10161-8{_}2713{_}Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,   Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:   Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;   A breath can make them, as a breath has made:   But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,   When once destroyed, can never be supplied.
10161-8{_}2714{_}A time there was, ere England's griefs began,   When every rood of ground maintained its man;   For him light labour spread her wholesome store,   Just gave what life required, but gave no more:   His best companions, innocence and health;   And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
10161-8{_}2715{_}But times are altered; trade's unfeeling train   Usurp the land and dispossess the swain;   Along the lawn, where scattered hamlets rose,   Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose,   And every want to opulence allied,   And every pang that folly pays to pride.
10161-8{_}2716{_}These gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,   Those calm desires that asked but little room,   Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,   Lived in each look, and brightened all the green;   These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,   And rural mirth and manners are no more.
10161-8{_}2717{_}Sweet Auburn!
10161-8{_}2718{_}parent of the blissful hour,   Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.
10161-8{_}2719{_}Here, as I take my solitary rounds   Amidst thy tangling walks and ruined grounds,   And, many a year elapsed, return to view   Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,   Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,   Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.
10161-8{_}2720{_}In all my wanderings round this world of care,   In all my griefs--and God has given my share--   I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,   Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;   To husband out life's taper at the close,   And keep the flame from wasting by repose:   I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,   Amidst the swains to show my book-learned skill,   Around my fire an evening group to draw,   And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;   And, as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue   Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,   I still had hopes, my long vexations past,   Here to return--and die at home at last.
10161-8{_}2721{_}O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,   Retreats from care, that never must be mine,   How happy he who crowns in shades like these   A youth of labour with an age of ease;   Who quits a world where strong temptations try,   And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!
10161-8{_}2722{_}For him no wretches, born to work and weep,   Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;   No surly porter stands in guilty state,   To spurn imploring famine from the gate;   But on he moves to meet his latter end,   Angels around befriending Virtue's friend;   Bends to the grave with unperceived decay,   While resignation gently slopes the way;   And, all his prospects brightening to the last,   His Heaven commences ere the world be past!
10161-8{_}2723{_}Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening's close   Up yonder hill the village murmur rose.
10161-8{_}2724{_}There, as I passed with careless steps and slow,   The mingling notes came softened from below;   The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,   The sober herd that lowed to meet their young,   The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,   The playful children just let loose from school,   The watch-dog's voice that bayed the whispering wind,   And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;--   These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,   And filled each pause the nightingale had made.
10161-8{_}2725{_}But now the sounds of population fail,   No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,   No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,   For all the bloomy flush of life is fled.
10161-8{_}2726{_}All but yon widowed, solitary thing,   That feebly bends beside the plashy spring:   She, wretched matron, forced in age, for bread,   To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,   To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,   To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;   She only left of all the harmless train,   The sad historian of the pensive plain.
10161-8{_}2727{_}Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,   And still where many a garden flower grows wild;   There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,   The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
10161-8{_}2728{_}A man he was to all the country dear,   And passing rich with forty pounds a year;   Remote from towns he ran his godly race,   Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change his place;   Unpractised he to fawn, or seek for power,   By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;   Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,   More skilled to raise the wretched than to rise.
10161-8{_}2729{_}His house was known to all the vagrant train;   He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain:   The long-remembered beggar was his guest,   Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;   The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,   Claimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed;   The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,   Sate by his fire, and talked the night away,   Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,   Shouldered his crutch and showed how fields were won.
10161-8{_}2730{_}Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,   And quite forget their vices in their woe;   Careless their merits or their faults to scan,   His pity gave ere charity began.
10161-8{_}2731{_}Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,   And e'en his failings leaned to Virtue's side;   But in his duty prompt at every call,   He watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for all;    And, as a bird each fond endearment tries   To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,   He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,   Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
10161-8{_}2732{_}Beside the bed where parting life was laid,   And sorrow, guilt, and pain by turns dismayed,   The reverend champion stood.
10161-8{_}2733{_}At his control   Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;   Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,   And his last faltering accents whispered praise.
10161-8{_}2734{_}At church, with meek and unaffected grace,   His looks adorned the venerable place;   Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,   And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.
10161-8{_}2735{_}The service past, around the pious man,   With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;   Even children followed with endearing wile,   And plucked his gown to share the good man's smile.
10161-8{_}2736{_}His ready smile a parent's warmth expressed;   Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed:   To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,   But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.
10161-8{_}2737{_}As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,   Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,   Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,   Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
10161-8{_}2738{_}Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,   With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,   There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,   The village master taught his little school.
10161-8{_}2739{_}A man severe he was, and stern to view;   I knew him well, and every truant knew;   Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace   The days' disasters in his morning face;   Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee   At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;   Full well the busy whisper circling round   Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.
10161-8{_}2740{_}Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,   The love he bore to learning was in fault:   The village all declared how much he knew;   'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;   Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,   And even the story ran that he could gauge;   In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,   For, even though vanquished, he could argue still;   While words of learned length and thundering sound   Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;   And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,   That one small head could carry all he knew.
10161-8{_}2741{_}But past is all his fame.
10161-8{_}2742{_}The very spot   Where many a time he triumphed is forgot.
10161-8{_}2743{_}Wear yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,   Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,   Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,   Where graybeard mirth and smiling toil retired,   Where village statesmen talked with looks profound,   And news much older than their ale went round.
10161-8{_}2744{_}Imagination fondly stoops to trace   The parlour splendours of that festive place:   The whitewashed wall, the nicely sanded floor,   The varnished clock that clicked behind the door:   The chest contrived a double debt to pay,   A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;   The pictures placed for ornament and use,   The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;   The hearth, except when winter chilled the day,   With aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay;   While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,   Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.
10161-8{_}2745{_}Vain transitory splendours could not all   Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall?
10161-8{_}2746{_}Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart   An hour's importance to the poor man's heart.
10161-8{_}2747{_}Thither no more the peasant shall repair   To sweet oblivion of his daily care;   No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,   No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;   No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,   Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;   The host himself no longer shall be found   Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;   Nor the coy maid, half willing to be pressed,   Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.
10161-8{_}2748{_}Yes!
10161-8{_}2749{_}let the rich deride, the proud disdain,   These simple blessings of the lowly train;   To me more dear, congenial to my heart,   One native charm, than all the gloss of art.
10161-8{_}2750{_}Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,   The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;   Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,   Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined.
10161-8{_}2751{_}But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,   With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed--   In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,   The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;   And, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,   The heart distrusting asks if this be joy.
10161-8{_}2752{_}Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen who survey   The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,   'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand   Between a splendid and an happy land.
10161-8{_}2753{_}Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,   And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;   Hoards e'en beyond the miser's wish abound,   And rich men flock from all the world around.
10161-8{_}2754{_}Yet count our gains!
10161-8{_}2755{_}This wealth is but a name   That leaves our useful products still the same.
10161-8{_}2756{_}Not so the loss.
10161-8{_}2757{_}The man of wealth and pride   Takes up a space that many poor supplied;   Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,   Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds:   The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth   Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;   His seat, where solitary sports are seen,   Indignant spurns the cottage from the green:   Around the world each needful product flies,   For all the luxuries the world supplies;   While thus the land adorned for pleasure all   In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.
10161-8{_}2758{_}As some fair female unadorned and plain,   Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,   Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,   Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;   But when those charms are passed, for charms are frail,   When time advances, and when lovers fail,   She then, shines forth, solicitous to bless,   In all the glaring impotence of dress.
10161-8{_}2759{_}Thus fares the land by luxury betrayed:   In nature's simplest charms at first arrayed,   But verging to decline, its splendours rise,   Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;   While, scourged by famine from the smiling land   The mournful peasant leads his humble band,   And while he sinks, without one arm to save,   The country blooms--a garden and a grave.
10161-8{_}2760{_}Where then, ah!
10161-8{_}2761{_}where, shall poverty reside,   To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?
10161-8{_}2762{_}If to some common's fenceless limits strayed,   He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,   Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,   And even the bare-worn common is denied.
10161-8{_}2763{_}If to the city sped--what waits him there?
10161-8{_}2764{_}To see profusion that he must not share;   To see ten thousand baneful arts combined   To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;   To see those joys the sons of pleasure know   Extorted from his fellow-creature's woe.
10161-8{_}2765{_}Here while the courtier glitters in brocade,   There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;   Here while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,   There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.
10161-8{_}2766{_}The dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign   Here, richly decked, admits the gorgeous train:   Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,   The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.
10161-8{_}2767{_}Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!
10161-8{_}2768{_}Sure these denote one universal joy!
10161-8{_}2769{_}Are these thy serious thoughts?--Ah, turn thine eyes   Where the poor houseless shivering female lies.
10161-8{_}2770{_}She once, perhaps, in village plenty blessed,   Has wept at tales of innocence distressed;   Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,   Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:   Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,   Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,   And, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,   With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,     When idly first, ambitious of the town,   She left her wheel and robes of country brown.
10161-8{_}2771{_}Do thine, sweet Auburn,--thine, the loveliest train,--   Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?
10161-8{_}2772{_}Even now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,   At proud men's doors they ask a little bread!
10161-8{_}2773{_}Ah, no!
10161-8{_}2774{_}To distant climes, a dreary scene,   Where half the convex world intrudes between,   Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,   Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.
10161-8{_}2775{_}Far different there from all that charmed before   The various terrors of that horrid shore;   Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,   And fiercely shed intolerable day;   Those matted woods, where birds forget to sing,   But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;   Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned,   Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;   Where at each step the stranger fears to wake   The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;   Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,   And savage men more murderous still than they;   While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,   Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.
10161-8{_}2776{_}Far different these from every former scene,   The cooling brook, the grassy vested green,   The breezy covert of the warbling grove,   That only sheltered thefts of harmless love.
10161-8{_}2777{_}Good Heaven!
10161-8{_}2778{_}what sorrows gloomed that parting day,   That called them from their native walks away;   When the poor exiles, every pleasure passed,   Hung round the bowers, and fondly looked their last,   And took a long farewell, and wished in vain   For seats like these beyond the western main,   And shuddering still to face the distant deep,   Returned and wept, and still returned to weep,   The good old sire the first prepared to go   To new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;   But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,   He only wished for worlds beyond the grave.
10161-8{_}2779{_}His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,   The fond companion of his helpless years,   Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,   And left a lover's for a father's arms.
10161-8{_}2780{_}With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,   And blest the cot where every pleasure rose,   And kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear,   And clasped them close, in sorrow doubly dear,   Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief   In all the silent manliness of grief.
10161-8{_}2781{_}O luxury!
10161-8{_}2782{_}thou cursed by Heaven's decree,   How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!
10161-8{_}2783{_}How do thy potions, with insidious joy,   Diffuse their pleasure only to destroy!
10161-8{_}2784{_}Kingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,   Boast of a florid vigour not their own.
10161-8{_}2785{_}At every draught more large and large they grow,   A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;   Till sapped their strength, and every part unsound,   Down, down, they sink, and spread a ruin round.
10161-8{_}2786{_}Even now the devastation is begun,   And half the business of destruction done;   Even now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,   I see the rural Virtues leave the land.
10161-8{_}2787{_}Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,   That idly waiting flaps with every gale,   Downward they move, a melancholy band,   Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand.
10161-8{_}2788{_}Contented Toil, and hospitable Care,   And kind connubial Tenderness, ate there;   And Piety with wishes placed above,   And steady Loyalty, and faithful Love.
10161-8{_}2789{_}And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,   Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;   Unfit in these degenerate times of shame   To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;   Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,   My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;   Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,   That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;   Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,   Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!
10161-8{_}2790{_}Farewell, and oh!
10161-8{_}2791{_}where'er thy voice be tried,   On Torno's cliffs, or Pambamarca's side,   Whether where equinoctial fervours glow,   Or winter wraps the polar world in snow,   Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,   Redress the rigours of th' inclement clime;   Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain;   Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;   Teach him, that states of native strength possessed,   Though very poor, may still be very blessed;   That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,   As ocean sweeps the laboured mole away;   While self-dependent power can time defy,   As rocks resist the billows and the sky.
10161-8{_}2792{_}FROM RETALIATION    Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such   We scarcely can praise it or blame it too much;   Who, born for the universe, narrowed his mind,   And to party gave up what was meant for mankind;   Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat   To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote;   Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,   And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;   Though equal to all things, for all things unfit--   Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit,   For a patriot too cool, for a drudge disobedient,   And too fond of the right to pursue the expedient:   In short, 'twas his fate, unemployed or in place, sir,   To eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor.
10161-8{_}2793{_}*       *       *       *       *    Here Cumberland lies, having acted his parts,   The Terence of England, the mender of hearts;   A flattering painter, who made it his care   To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are:   His gallants are all faultless, his women divine,   And Comedy wonders at being so fine--   Like a tragedy-queen he has dizened her out,   Or rather like Tragedy giving a rout;   His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd   Of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud;   And coxcombs, alike in their failings alone,   Adopting his portraits, are pleased with their own.
10161-8{_}2794{_}Say, where has our poet this malady caught,   Or wherefore his characters thus without fault?
10161-8{_}2795{_}Say, was it that, vainly directing his view   To find out men's virtues, and finding them few,   Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,   He grew lazy at last and drew from himself?
10161-8{_}2796{_}*       *       *       *       *    Here lies David Garrick: describe me, who can,   An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;   As an actor, confessed without rival to shine;   As a wit, if not first, in the very first line.
10161-8{_}2797{_}Yet with talents like these, and an excellent heart,   The man had his failings, a dupe to his art:   Like an ill-judging beauty his colours he spread,   And beplastered with rouge his own natural red;   On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting--   'Twas only that when he was off he was acting.
10161-8{_}2798{_}With no reason on earth to go out of his way,   He turned and he varied full ten times a day:   Though secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick   If they were not his own by finessing and trick;   He cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,   For he knew when he pleased he could whistle them back.
10161-8{_}2799{_}Of praise a mere glutton, he swallowed what came,   And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;   Till, his relish grown callous, almost to disease,   Who peppered the highest was surest to please.
10161-8{_}2800{_}But let us be candid, and speak out our mind:   If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind;   Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls so grave,   What a commerce was yours while you got and you gave!
10161-8{_}2801{_}How did Grub Street re-echo the shouts that you raised,   While he was be-Rosciused and you were bepraised!
10161-8{_}2802{_}But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies   To act as an angel and mix with the skies!
10161-8{_}2803{_}Those poets who owe their best fame to his skill   Shall still be his flatterers, go where he will;    Old Shakespeare receive him with praise and with love,   And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.

10161-8{_}2805{_}His pencil was striking, resistless, and grand;   His manners were gentle, complying, and bland;   Still born to improve us in every part--   His pencil oar faces, his manners our heart.
10161-8{_}2806{_}To coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,   When they judged without skill he was still hard of hearing;   When they talked of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,   He shifted his trumpet, and only took snuff.
10161-8{_}2807{_}JAMES BEATTIE     FROM THE MINSTREL; OR, THE PROGRESS   OF GENIUS    Fret not thyself, thou glittering child of pride,   That a poor villager inspires my strain;   With thee let pageantry and power abide:   The gentle Muses haunt the sylvan reign;   Where through wild groves at eve the lonely swain   Enraptured roams, to gaze on Nature's charms.
10161-8{_}2808{_}They hate the sensual, and scorn the vain,   The parasite their influence never warms,   Nor him whose sordid soul the love of gold alarms.

10161-8{_}2813{_}Dainties he heeded not, nor gaud, nor toy,   Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy;   Silent when glad; affectionate, though shy;   And now his look was most demurely sad;   And now he laughed aloud, yet none knew why.
10161-8{_}2814{_}The neighbours stared and sighed, yet blessed the lad;   Some deemed him wondrous wise, and some believed him mad.

10161-8{_}2817{_}Even sad vicissitude amused his soul;   And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,   And down his cheek a tear of pity roll,   A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wished not to control.

10161-8{_}2986{_}GEORGE CRABBE     From THE LIBRARY    When the sad soul, by care and grief oppressed,   Looks round the world, but looks in vain for rest;   When every object that appears in view,   Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too;   Where shall affliction from itself retire?
10161-8{_}2987{_}Where fade away and placidly expire?
10161-8{_}2988{_}Alas!
10161-8{_}2989{_}we fly to silent scenes in vain;   Care blasts the honours of the flowery plain:   Care veils in clouds the sun's meridian beam,   Sighs through the grove, and murmurs in the stream;   For when the soul is labouring in despair,   In vain the body breathes a purer air.

10161-8{_}2992{_}methinks a thousand tongues reply,   'These are the tombs of such as cannot die!

10161-8{_}2996{_}*       *       *       *       *    But who are these, a tribe that soar above,   And tell more tender tales of modern love?
10161-8{_}2997{_}A _novel_ train!
10161-8{_}2998{_}the brood of old Romance,   Conceived by Folly on the coast of France,   That now with lighter thought and gentler fire,   Usurp the honours of their drooping sire:   And still fantastic, vain, and trifling, sing   Of many a soft and inconsistent thing,--   Of rakes repenting, clogged in Hymen's chain,   Of nymph reclined by unpresuming swain,   Of captains, colonels, lords, and amorous knights,   That find in humbler nymphs such chaste delights.
10161-8{_}2999{_}Such heavenly charms, so gentle, yet so gay,   That all their former follies fly away:   Honour springs up, where'er their looks impart   A moment's sunshine to the hardened heart;   A virtue, just before the rover's jest,   Grows like a mushroom in his melting breast.
10161-8{_}3000{_}Much too they tell of cottages and shades.
10161-8{_}3001{_}Of balls, and routs, and midnight masquerades,   Where dangerous men and dangerous mirth reside,   And Virtue goes----on purpose to be tried.
10161-8{_}3002{_}These are the tales that wake the soul to life,   That charm the sprightly niece and forward wife,   That form the manners of a polished age,   And each pure easy moral of the stage.
10161-8{_}3003{_}FROM THE VILLAGE    The village life, and every care that reigns   O'er youthful peasants and declining swains;   What labour yields, and what, that labour past,   Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;   What form the real picture of the poor,   Demand a song--the Muse can give no more.
10161-8{_}3004{_}Fled are those times when, in harmonious strains,   The rustic poet praised his native plains;   No shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,   Their country's beauty or their nymphs' rehearse:   Yet still for these we frame the tender strain;   Still in our lays fond Corydons complain,   And shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal--   The only pains, alas!
10161-8{_}3005{_}they never feel.
10161-8{_}3006{_}On Mincio's banks, in Caesar's bounteous reign,   If Tityrus found the Golden Age again,   Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,   Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?
10161-8{_}3007{_}From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray,   Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?
10161-8{_}3008{_}Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,   Because the Muses never knew their pains.
10161-8{_}3009{_}They boast their peasants' pipes; but peasants now   Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough,   And few amid the rural tribe have time   To number syllables and play with rhyme:   Save honest Duck, what son of verse could share   The poet's rapture and the peasant's care,   Or the great labours of the field degrade   With the new peril of a poorer trade?
10161-8{_}3010{_}From this chief cause these idle praises spring--   That themes so easy few forbear to sing,   For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask;   To sing of shepherds is an easy task:   The happy youth assumes the common strain,   A nymph his mistress, and himself a swain;   With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,   But all, to look like her, is painted fair.
10161-8{_}3011{_}I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms   For him that grazes or for him that farms;   But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace   The poor laborious natives of the place,   And see the mid-day sun with fervid ray   On their bare heads and dewy temples play,   While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts   Deplore their fortune yet sustain their parts,   Then shall I dare these real ills to hide   In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?
10161-8{_}3012{_}No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,   Which neither groves nor happy valleys boast;   Where other cares than those the Muse relates,   And other shepherds dwell with other mates;   By such examples taught, I paint the cot   As Truth will paint it and as bards will not.
10161-8{_}3013{_}Nor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn complain:   To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;   O'ercome by labour and bowed down by time,   Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?
10161-8{_}3014{_}Can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,   By winding myrtles round your ruined shed?
10161-8{_}3015{_}Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower,   Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?
10161-8{_}3016{_}Lo!
10161-8{_}3017{_}where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,   Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;   From thence a length of burning sand appears,   Where the thin harvest waves its withered ears;   Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,   Reign o'er the land and rob the blighted rye:   There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,   And to the ragged infant threaten war;   There poppies nodding, mock the hope of toil;   There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;   Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,   The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;   O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,   And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade;   With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,   And a sad splendour vainly shines around.
10161-8{_}3018{_}*       *       *       *       *    Here, wandering long, amid these frowning fields,   I sought the simple life that Nature yields:   Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurped her place,   And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;   Who, only skilled to take the finny tribe,   The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe,   Wait on the shore, and, as the waves run high,   On the tossed vessel bend their eager eye,   Which to their coast directs its venturous way;   Theirs or the ocean's miserable prey.
10161-8{_}3019{_}As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,   And wait for favouring winds to leave the land;   While still for flight the ready wing is spread:   So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;   Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,   And cried, 'Ah!
10161-8{_}3020{_}hapless they who still remain:   Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,   Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;    Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway   Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;   When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,   And begs a poor protection from the poor!'
10161-8{_}3021{_}But these are scenes where Nature's niggard hand   Gave a spare portion to the famished land;   Hers is the fault, if here mankind complain   Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain;   But yet in other scenes more fair in view,   Where Plenty smiles--alas!
10161-8{_}3022{_}she smiles for few--   And those who taste not, yet behold her store,   Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore--   The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.
10161-8{_}3023{_}Or will you deem them amply paid in health,   Labour's fair child, that languishes with wealth?
10161-8{_}3024{_}Go, then!
10161-8{_}3025{_}and see them rising with the sun,   Through a long course of daily toil to run;   See them beneath the Dog-star's raging heat,   When the knees tremble and the temples beat;   Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er   The labour past, and toils to come explore;   See them alternate suns and showers engage,   And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;   Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,   When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;   Then own that labour may as fatal be   To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee.
10161-8{_}3026{_}Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride   Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;   There may you see the youth of slender frame   Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame;   Yet, urged along, and proudly both to yield,   He strives to join his fellows of the field;   Till long-contending, nature droops at last,   Declining health rejects his poor repast,   His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,   And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.
10161-8{_}3027{_}Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell,   Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;   Or will you praise that homely, healthy fare,   Plenteous and plain, that happy peasants share!
10161-8{_}3028{_}Oh!
10161-8{_}3029{_}trifle not with wants you cannot feel,   Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;   Homely, not wholesome, plain, not plenteous, such   As you who praise, would never deign to touch.
10161-8{_}3030{_}Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,   Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;   Go!
10161-8{_}3031{_}if the peaceful cot your praises share,   Go look within, and ask if peace be there;   If peace be his, that drooping weary sire;   Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire;   Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand   Turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand,    Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these   Life's latest comforts, due respect and ease;   For yonder see that hoary swain, whose age   Can with no cares except its own engage;   Who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to see   The bare arms broken from the withering tree,   On which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough,   Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now.
10161-8{_}3032{_}He once was chief in all the rustic trade;   His steady hand the straightest furrow made;   Full many a prize he won, and still is proud   To find the triumphs of his youth allowed;   A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes.
10161-8{_}3033{_}He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs;   For now he journeys to his grave in pain;   The rich disdain him; nay, the poor disdain:   Alternate masters now their slave command,   Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,   And, when his age attempts its task in vain,   With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain.
10161-8{_}3034{_}Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,   His winter charge, beneath the hillock weep;   Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow   O'er his white locks and bury them in snow,   When, roused by rage and muttering in the morn,   He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:--    'Why do I live, when I desire to be   At once from life and life's long labour free?
10161-8{_}3035{_}Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,   Without the sorrows of a slow decay;   I, like you withered leaf, remain behind,   Nipped by the frost, and shivering in the wind;   There it abides till younger buds come on   As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone;   Then from the rising generation thrust,   It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust.
10161-8{_}3036{_}'These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,   Are others' gain, but killing cares to me;   To me the children of my youth are lords,   Cool in their looks, but hasty in their words:   Wants of their own demand their care; and who   Feels his own want and succours others too?
10161-8{_}3037{_}A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,   None need my help, and none relieve my woe;   Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,   And men forget the wretch they would not aid.'
10161-8{_}3038{_}Thus groan the old, till by disease oppressed,   They taste a final woe, and then they rest.
10161-8{_}3039{_}Theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor,   Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;   There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,   And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;   There children dwell who know no parents' care;   Parents, who know no children's love, dwell there!
10161-8{_}3040{_}Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,   Forsaken wives, and mothers never wed;   Dejected widows with unheeded tears,   And crippled age with more than childhood fears;   The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!
10161-8{_}3041{_}The moping idiot, and the madman gay.
10161-8{_}3042{_}Here too the sick their final doom receive,   Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,   Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,   Mixed with the clamours of the crowd below;   Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,   And the cold charities of man to man:   Whose laws indeed for ruined age provide,   And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;   But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,   And pride embitters what it can't deny.
10161-8{_}3043{_}Say, ye, oppressed by some fantastic woes,   Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;   Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance   With timid eye to read the distant glance;   Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease   To name the nameless, ever-new, disease;   Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,   Which real pain, and that alone, can cure;   How would ye bear in real pain to lie,   Despised, neglected, left alone to die?
10161-8{_}3044{_}How would, ye bear to draw your latest breath   Where all that's wretched paves the way for death?
10161-8{_}3045{_}Such is that room which one rude beam divides,   And naked rafters form the sloping sides;   Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,   And lath and mud are all that lie between,   Save one dull pane that, coarsely patched, gives way   To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day:   Here on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread,   The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;   For him no hand the cordial cup applies,   Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;   No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,   Or promise hope till sickness wears a smile.
10161-8{_}3046{_}But soon a load and hasty summons calls,   Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;   Anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,   All pride and business, bustle and conceit;   With looks unaltered by these scenes of woe,   With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,   He bids the gazing throng around him fly,   And carries fate and physic in his eye:   A potent quack, long versed in human ills,   Who first insults the victim whom he kills;   Whose murderous hand a drowsy Bench protect,   And whose most tender mercy is neglect.
10161-8{_}3047{_}Paid by the parish for attendance here,   He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;   In haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,   Impatience marked in his averted eyes;   And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,   Without reply he rushes on the door:   His drooping patient, long inured to pain,   And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;   He ceases now the feeble help to crave   Of man; and silent sinks into the grave.
10161-8{_}3048{_}But ere his death some pious doubts arise,   Some simple fears, which 'bold bad' men despise;   Fain would he ask the parish-priest to prove   His title certain to the joys above:   For this he sends the murm'ring nurse, who calls   The holy stranger to these dismal walls:   And doth not he, the pious man, appear,   He, 'passing rich with forty pounds a year?'
10161-8{_}3049{_}Ah!
10161-8{_}3050{_}no; a shepherd of a different stock,   And far unlike him, feeds this little flock:   A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's task   As much as God or man can fairly ask;   The rest he gives to loves and labours light,   To fields the morning, and to feasts the night;   None better skilled the noisy pack to guide,   To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;   A sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,   And, skilled at whist, devotes the night to play:   Then, while such honours bloom around his head,   Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bed,   To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal   To combat fears that e'en the pious feel?

10161-8{_}3052{_}the riots of the green begin,   That sprang at first from yonder noisy inn;   What time the weekly pay was vanished all,   And the slow hostess scored the threatening wall;   What time they asked, their friendly feast to close,   A final cup, and that will make them foes;   When blows ensue that break the arm of toil,   And rustic battle ends the boobies' broil.
10161-8{_}3053{_}Save when to yonder hall they bend their way,   Where the grave justice ends the grievous fray;   He who recites, to keep the poor in awe,   The law's vast volume--for he knows the law:--   To him with anger or with shame repair   The injured peasant and deluded fair.
10161-8{_}3054{_}Lo!
10161-8{_}3055{_}at his throne the silent nymph appears,   Frail by her shape, but modest in her tears;   And while she stands abashed, with conscious eye,   Some favourite female of her judge glides by,   Who views with scornful glance the strumpet's fate,   And thanks the stars that made her keeper great;   Near her the swain, about to bear for life   One certain, evil, doubts 'twixt war and wife;   But, while the faltering damsel takes her oath,   Consents to wed, and so secures them both.
10161-8{_}3056{_}Yet why, you ask, these humble crimes relate,   Why make the poor as guilty as the great?
10161-8{_}3057{_}To show the great, those mightier sons of pride,   How near in vice the lowest are allied;   Such are their natures and their passions such,   But these disguise too little, those too much:   So shall the man of power and pleasure see   In his own slave as vile a wretch as he;   In his luxurious lord the servant find   His own low pleasures and degenerate mind;   And each in all the kindred vices trace   Of a poor, blind, bewildered, erring race;   Who, a short time in varied fortune past,   Die, and are equal in the dust at last.
10161-8{_}3058{_}JOHN NEWTON     A VISION OF LIFE IN DEATH    In evil long I took delight,   Unawed by shame or fear,   Till a new object struck my sight,   And stopped my wild career;   I saw One hanging on a Tree   In agonies and Blood,   Who fixed His languid eyes on me,   As near His cross I stood.
10161-8{_}3059{_}Sure never till my latest breath   Can I forget that look:   It seemed to charge me with His death,   Though not a word he spoke:   My conscience felt and owned the guilt,   And plunged me in despair;   I saw my sins His blood had spilt,   And helped to nail Him there.
10161-8{_}3060{_}Alas!
10161-8{_}3061{_}I know not what I did!
10161-8{_}3062{_}But now my tears are vain:   Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
10161-8{_}3063{_}For I the Lord have slain!
10161-8{_}3064{_}A second look He gave, which said,   'I freely all forgive;   The blood is for thy ransom paid;   I die, that thou may'st live.'
10161-8{_}3065{_}Thus, while His death my sin displays   In all its blackest hue,   Such is the mystery of grace,   It seals my pardon too.
10161-8{_}3066{_}With pleasing grief and mournful joy,   My spirit now is filled   That I should such a life destroy,--   Yet live by Him I killed.

10161-8{_}3162{_}No noise is here, or none that hinders thought.
10161-8{_}3163{_}The redbreast warbles still, but is content   With slender notes, and more than half suppressed:   Pleased with, his solitude, and flitting light   From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes   From many a twig the pendent drops of ice,   That tinkle in the withered leaves below.
10161-8{_}3164{_}Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,   Charms more than silence.
10161-8{_}3165{_}Meditation here   May think down hours to moments.
10161-8{_}3166{_}Here the heart   May give a useful lesson to the head,   And learning wiser grow without his books.
10161-8{_}3167{_}Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,   Have ofttimes no connection.
10161-8{_}3168{_}Knowledge dwells   In heads replete with thoughts of other men,   Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
10161-8{_}3169{_}Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,   The mere materials with which wisdom builds,   'Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,   Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
10161-8{_}3170{_}Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;   Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
10161-8{_}3171{_}Books are not seldom talismans and spells,   By which the magic art of shrewder wits   Holds an unthinking multitude enthralled.
10161-8{_}3172{_}Some to the fascination of a name   Surrender judgment hoodwinked.
10161-8{_}3173{_}Some the style   Infatuates, and through labyrinths and wilds   Of error leads them, by a tune entranced.
10161-8{_}3174{_}While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear   The insupportable fatigue of thought,   And swallowing therefore, without pause or choice,   The total grist unsifted, husks and all.
10161-8{_}3175{_}But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course   Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,   And sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs,   And lanes in which the primrose ere her time   Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,   Deceive no student.
10161-8{_}3176{_}Wisdom there, and Truth,   Not shy as in the world, and to be won   By slow solicitation, seize at once   The roving thought, and fix it on themselves.
10161-8{_}3177{_}[KINDNESS TO ANIMALS]    I would not enter on my list of friends,   Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,   Yet wanting sensibility, the man   Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
10161-8{_}3178{_}An inadvertent, step may crush the snail   That crawls at evening in the public path;   But he that has humanity, forewarned,   Will tread aside and let the reptile live.
10161-8{_}3179{_}The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,   And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes,   A visitor unwelcome, into scenes   Sacred to neatness and repose--th' alcove,   The chamber, or refectory,--may die:   A necessary act incurs no blame.
10161-8{_}3180{_}Not so when, held within their proper bounds   And guiltless of offence, they range the air,   Or take their pastime in the spacious field:   There they are privileged; and he that hunts   Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong,   Disturbs th' economy of Nature's realm,   Who, when she formed, designed them an abode.
10161-8{_}3181{_}ON THE RECEIPT OF MY MOTHER'S PICTURE    O that those lips had language!
10161-8{_}3182{_}Life has passed   With me but roughly since I heard thee last.
10161-8{_}3183{_}Those lips are thine--thy own sweet smile I see,   The same that oft in childhood solaced me;   Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,   'Grieve not, my child, chase all thy fears away!'
10161-8{_}3184{_}The meek intelligence of those dear eyes   (Blest be the art that can immortalize,   The art that baffles Time's tyrannic claim   To quench it) here shines on me still the same.
10161-8{_}3185{_}Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,   O welcome guest, though unexpected here!
10161-8{_}3186{_}Who bidd'st me honour with an artless song,   Affectionate, a mother lost so long,   I will obey, not willingly alone,   But gladly, as the precept were her own:   And, while that face renews my filial grief,   Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,   Shall steep me in Elysian revery,   A momentary dream that thou art she.
10161-8{_}3187{_}My mother!
10161-8{_}3188{_}when I learned that thou wast dead,   Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
10161-8{_}3189{_}Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,   Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
10161-8{_}3190{_}Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unfelt, a kiss;   Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss--   Ah, that maternal smile!
10161-8{_}3191{_}it answers 'Yes,'   I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,   I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,   And, turning from my nursery window, drew   A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
10161-8{_}3192{_}But was it such?
10161-8{_}3193{_}It was: where thou art gone   Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.
10161-8{_}3194{_}May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,   The parting word shall pass my lips no more!
10161-8{_}3195{_}Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,   Oft gave me promise of thy quick return.
10161-8{_}3196{_}What ardently I wished I long believed,   And, disappointed still, was still deceived,   By expectation every day beguiled,   Dupe of to-morrow even from a child.
10161-8{_}3197{_}Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,   Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,   I learnt at last submission to my lot,   But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot.
10161-8{_}3198{_}Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more:   Children not thine have trod my nursery floor;   And where the gardener Robin, day by day,   Drew me to school along the public way,   Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapped   In scarlet, mantle warm, and velvet-capped,   'Tis now become a history little known   That once we called the pastoral house our own.
10161-8{_}3199{_}Short-lived possession!
10161-8{_}3200{_}But the record fair   That memory keeps, of all thy kindness there,   Still outlives many a storm that has effaced   A thousand other themes less deeply traced.
10161-8{_}3201{_}Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,   That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid;   Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,   The biscuit or confectionary plum;   The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed   By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed;   All this, and, more endearing still than all,   Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,   Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks   That humour interposed too often makes;   All this, still legible on memory's page,   And still to be so to my latest age,   Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay   Such honours to thee as my numbers may,   Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,   Not scorned in heaven though little noticed here.
10161-8{_}3202{_}Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours   When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flowers,   The violet, the pink, the jessamine,   I pricked them into paper with a pin   (And thou wast happier than myself the while,   Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head and smile),   Could those few pleasant days again appear,   Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?
10161-8{_}3203{_}I would not trust my heart--the dear delight   Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might.
10161-8{_}3204{_}But no--what here we call our life is such,   So little to be loved, and thou so much,   That I should ill requite thee to constrain   Thy unbound spirit into bonds again.
10161-8{_}3205{_}Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast,   The storms all weathered and the ocean crossed,   Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,   Where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile,   There sits quiescent on the floods, that show   Her beauteous form reflected clear below,   While airs impregnated with incense play   Around her, fanning light her streamers gay,   So thou, with sails how swift, hast reached the shore   'Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,'   And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide   Of life long since has anchored by thy side.
10161-8{_}3206{_}But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,   Always from port withheld, always distressed,   Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-tossed,   Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost,   And day by day some current's thwarting force   Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.
10161-8{_}3207{_}Yet, oh, the thought that thou art safe, and he,   That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.
10161-8{_}3208{_}My boast is not that I deduce my birth   From loins enthroned and rulers of the earth;   But higher far my proud pretensions rise--   The son of parents passed into the skies!
10161-8{_}3209{_}And now, farewell.
10161-8{_}3210{_}Time unrevoked has run   His wonted course, yet what I wished is done:   By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,   I seem t' have lived my childhood o'er again,   To have renewed the joys that once were mine,   Without the sin of violating thine;   And while the wings of Fancy still are free,   And I can view this mimic show of thee,   Time has but half succeeded in his theft--   Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.
10161-8{_}3211{_}TO MARY    The twentieth year is well-nigh past,   Since first our sky was overcast;   Ah, would that this might be the last!
10161-8{_}3212{_}My Mary!
10161-8{_}3213{_}Thy spirits have a fainter flow,   I see thee daily weaker grow;   'Twas my distress that brought thee low,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3214{_}Thy needles, once a shining store,   For my sake restless heretofore,   Now rust disused, and shine no more,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3215{_}For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil   The same kind office for me still,   Thy sight now seconds not thy will,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3216{_}But well thou playedst the housewife's part,   And all thy threads with magic art   Have wound themselves about this heart,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3217{_}Thy indistinct expressions seem   Like language uttered in a dream;   Yet me they charm, whate'er the theme,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3218{_}Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,   Are still more lovely in my sight   Than golden beams of orient light,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3219{_}For, could I view nor them nor thee,   What sight worth seeing could I see?
10161-8{_}3220{_}The sun would rise in vain for me,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3221{_}Partakers of thy sad decline,   Thy hands their little force resign,   Yet, gently pressed, press gently mine,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3222{_}Such feebleness of limbs thou provest,   That now at every step thou movest   Upheld by two, yet still thou lovest,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3223{_}And still to love, though pressed with ill,   In wintry age to feel no chill,   With me is to be lovely still,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3224{_}But ah!
10161-8{_}3225{_}by constant heed I know,   How oft the sadness that I show   Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3226{_}And should my future lot be cast   With much resemblance of the past,   Thy worn-out heart will break at last,   My Mary!
10161-8{_}3227{_}THE CASTAWAY    Obscurest night involved the sky,   The Atlantic billows roared,   When such a destined wretch as I,   Washed headlong from on board,   Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,   His floating home forever left.
10161-8{_}3228{_}No-braver chief could Albion boast   Than he with whom he went,   Nor ever ship left Albion's coast   With warmer wishes sent.
10161-8{_}3229{_}He loved them both, but both in vain,   Nor him beheld, nor her again,    Not long beneath the whelming brine,   Expert to swim, he lay;   Nor soon he felt his strength decline,   Or courage die away;   But waged with death a lasting strife,   Supported by despair of life.
10161-8{_}3230{_}He shouted: nor his friends had failed   To check the vessel's course,   But so the furious blast prevailed,   That, pitiless perforce,   They left their outcast mate behind,   And scudded still before the wind.
10161-8{_}3231{_}Some succour yet they could afford;   And such as storms allow,   The cask, the coop, the floated cord,   Delayed not to bestow.
10161-8{_}3232{_}But he (they knew) nor ship nor shore,   Whate'er they gave, should visit more.
10161-8{_}3233{_}Nor, cruel as it seemed, could he   Their haste himself condemn,   Aware that flight, in such a sea,   Alone could rescue them;   Yet bitter felt it still to die   Deserted, and his friends so nigh.
10161-8{_}3234{_}He long survives, who lives an hour   In ocean, self-upheld;   And so long he, with unspent power,   His destiny repelled;   And ever, as the minutes flew,   Entreated help, or cried 'Adieu!'
10161-8{_}3235{_}At length, his transient respite past,   His comrades, who before   Had heard his voice in every blast,   Could catch the sound no more:   For then, by toil subdued, he drank   The stifling wave, and then he sank.
10161-8{_}3236{_}No poet wept him; but the page   Of narrative sincere,   That tells his name, his worth, his age,   Is wet with Anson's tear:   And tears by bards or heroes shed   Alike immortalize the dead.
10161-8{_}3237{_}I therefore purpose not, or dream,   Descanting on his fate,   To give the melancholy theme   A more enduring date:   But misery still delights to trace   Its semblance in another's case.
10161-8{_}3238{_}No voice divine the storm allayed,   No light propitious shone,   When, snatched from all effectual aid,   We perished, each alone:   But I beneath a rougher sea,   And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he.
10161-8{_}3239{_}WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES     EVENING    Evening!
10161-8{_}3240{_}as slow thy placid shades descend,   Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still,   The lonely battlement, the farthest hill   And wood, I think of those who have no friend;   Who now, perhaps, by melancholy led,   From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts,   Retiring, wander to the ringdove's haunts   Unseen; and watch the tints that o'er thy bed   Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy's eye   Presenting fairy vales, where the tired mind   Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind,   Nor hear the hourly moans of misery!
10161-8{_}3241{_}Alas for man!
10161-8{_}3242{_}that Hope's fair views the while   Should smile like you, and perish as they smile!
10161-8{_}3243{_}DOVER CLIFFS    On these white cliffs, that calm above the flood   Uprear their shadowing heads, and at their feet   Hear not the surge that has for ages beat,   How many a lonely wanderer has stood!
10161-8{_}3244{_}And, whilst the lifted murmur met his ear,   And o'er the distant billows the still eve   Sailed slow, has thought of all his heart must leave   To-morrow; of the friends he loved most dear;   Of social scenes, from which he wept to part!
10161-8{_}3245{_}Oh!
10161-8{_}3246{_}if, like me, he knew how fruitless all   The thoughts that would full fain the past recall,   Soon would he quell the risings of his heart,   And brave the wild winds and unhearing tide--   The world his country, and his God his guide.

10161-8{_}3250{_}Yestreen, when to the trembling string   The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha',   To thee my fancy took its wing;   I sat, but neither heard nor saw:   Tho' this was fair, and that was braw,   And yon the toast of a' the town,   I sighed, and said amang them a',   'Ye are na Mary Morison.'
10161-8{_}3251{_}O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace   Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
10161-8{_}3252{_}Or canst thou break that heart of his   Whase only faut is loving thee?
10161-8{_}3253{_}If love for love thou wilt na gie,   At least be pity to me shown!
10161-8{_}3254{_}A thought ungentle canna be   The thought o' Mary Morison.

10161-8{_}3257{_}As lightsomely I glowered abroad,   To see a scene sae gay,   Three hizzies, early at the road,   Cam skelpin up the way.
10161-8{_}3258{_}Twa had manteeles o' dolefu' black,   But ane wi' lyart lining;   The third, that gaed a wee a-back,   Was in the fashion shining   Fu' gay that day.
10161-8{_}3259{_}The twa appeared like sisters twin,   In feature, form, an' claes;   Their visage withered, lang an'thin,   An' sour as onie slaes:   The third cam up, hap-step-an'-lowp,   As light as onie lambie,   An' wi' a curchie low did stoop,   As soon as e'er she saw me,   Fu' kind that day.
10161-8{_}3260{_}Wi' bonnet aff, quoth I, 'Sweet lass,   I think ye seem to ken me;   I'm sure I've seen that bonie face,   But yet I canna name ye.'

10161-8{_}3327{_}Whene'er my Muse does on me glance,   I jingle at her.
10161-8{_}3328{_}Your critic-folk may cock their nose,   And say, 'How can you e'er propose,   You wha ken hardly verse frae prose,   To mak a sang?'
10161-8{_}3329{_}But, by your leaves, my learnèd foes,   Ye're maybe wrang.
10161-8{_}3330{_}What's a' your jargon o' your schools,   Your Latin names for horns an' stools?
10161-8{_}3331{_}If honest Nature made you fools,   What sairs your grammers?
10161-8{_}3332{_}Ye'd better taen up spades and shools   Or knappin-hammers.
10161-8{_}3333{_}A set o' dull, conceited hashes   Confuse their brains in college classes;   They gang in stirks, and come out asses,   Plain truth to speak;   An' syne they think to climb Parnassus   By dint o' Greek!
10161-8{_}3334{_}Gie me ae spark o' Nature's fire,   That's a' the learning I desire;   Then, tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire   At pleugh or cart,   My Muse, tho' hamely in attire,   May touch the heart.
10161-8{_}3335{_}THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT    My loved, my honoured, much respected friend!
10161-8{_}3336{_}No mercenary bard his homage pays;   With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end,   My dearest meed a friend's esteem and praise:   To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays,   The lowly train in life's sequestered scene;   The native feelings strong, the guileless ways,   What Aiken in a cottage would have been;   Ah, though his worth unknown, far happier there, I ween!
10161-8{_}3337{_}November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh;   The shortening winter-day is near a close;   The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh;   The blackening trains o' craws to their repose:   The toil-worn cotter frae his labour goes--   This night his weekly moil is at an end,--   Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes,   Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,   And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.
10161-8{_}3338{_}At length his lonely cot appears in view,   Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;   Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through   To meet their dad, wi' flichterin' noise and glee.
10161-8{_}3339{_}His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,   His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile,   The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,   Does a' his weary kiaugh and care beguile,   And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil.
10161-8{_}3340{_}Belyve the elder bairns come drapping in,   At service out amang the farmers roun';   Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin.
10161-8{_}3341{_}A cannie errand to a neebor town.
10161-8{_}3342{_}Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,   In youthfu' bloom, love sparkling in her e'e,   Comes hame, perhaps to shew a braw new gown,   Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee,   To help her parents dear if they in hardship be.
10161-8{_}3343{_}With joy unfeigned, brothers and sisters meet,   And each for other's weelfare kindly spiers;   The social hours, swift-winged, unnoticed fleet;   Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears.
10161-8{_}3344{_}The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;   Anticipation forward points the view.
10161-8{_}3345{_}The mother, wi' her needle and her sheers,   Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;   The father mixes a' wi' admonition due:    Their master's and their mistress's command   The younkers a' are warnèd to obey,   And mind their labours wi' an eydent hand,   And ne'er, tho' out o' sight, to jauk or play:   'And O be sure to fear the Lord alway,   And mind your duty duly, morn and night;   Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray,   Implore His counsel and assisting might:   They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright!'
10161-8{_}3346{_}But hark!
10161-8{_}3347{_}a rap comes gently to the door.
10161-8{_}3348{_}Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,   Tells how a neebor lad came o'er the moor,   To do some errands and convoy her hame.
10161-8{_}3349{_}The wily mother sees the conscious flame   Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek;   With heart-struck anxious care enquires his name,   While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;   Weel-pleased the mother hears it's nae wild, worthless rake.
10161-8{_}3350{_}With kindly welcome Jenny brings him ben:   A strappin' youth, he takes the mother's eye;   Blythe Jenny sees the visit's no ill-taen;   The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye.
10161-8{_}3351{_}The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,   But blate and laithfu', scarce can weel behave;   The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy   What makes the youth sae bashfu' and sae grave,   Weel-pleased to think her bairn's respected like the lave.
10161-8{_}3352{_}Oh happy love, where love like this is found!
10161-8{_}3353{_}Oh heart-felt raptures!
10161-8{_}3354{_}bliss beyond compare!
10161-8{_}3355{_}I've pacèd much this weary, mortal round,   And sage experience bids me this declare:   'If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare,   One cordial in this melancholy vale,   'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair   In other's arms breathe out the tender tale,   Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.'
10161-8{_}3356{_}Is there, in human form, that bears a heart,   A wretch!
10161-8{_}3357{_}a villain!
10161-8{_}3358{_}lost to love and truth!
10161-8{_}3359{_}That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art,   Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?
10161-8{_}3360{_}Curse on his perjured arts!
10161-8{_}3361{_}dissembling smooth!
10161-8{_}3362{_}Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exiled?
10161-8{_}3363{_}Is there no pity, no relenting ruth,   Points to the parents fondling o'er their child?
10161-8{_}3364{_}Then paints the ruined maid, and their distraction wild?
10161-8{_}3365{_}But now the supper crowns their simple hoard:   The healsome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food:   The soupe their only hawkie does afford,   That 'yont the hallan snugly chows her cood.
10161-8{_}3366{_}The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,   To grace the lad, her weel-hained kebbuek, fell;   And aft he's prest, and aft he ca's it guid;   The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell   How 'twas a towmond auld sin' lint was i' the bell.
10161-8{_}3367{_}The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face   They round the ingle form a circle wide;   The sire turns o'er, wi' patriarchal grace,   The big ha'-Bible, ance his father's pride;   His bonnet reverently is laid aside,   His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;   Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,   He wales a portion with judicious care,   And 'Let us worship God!'
10161-8{_}3368{_}he says, with solemn air.
10161-8{_}3369{_}They chant their artless notes in simple guise;   They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim:   Perhaps 'Dundee's' wild-warbling measures rise,   Or plaintive 'Martyrs,' worthy of the name;   Or noble 'Elgin' beets the heavenward flame,   The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays.
10161-8{_}3370{_}Compared with these, Italian trills are tame;   The tickled ears no heart-felt raptures raise;   Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.
10161-8{_}3371{_}The priest-like father reads the sacred page;   How Abram was the friend of God on high;   Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage   With Amalek's ungracious progeny;   Or how the royal bard did groaning lie   Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;   Or Job's pathetic plaint and wailing cry;   Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;   Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.
10161-8{_}3372{_}Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme:   How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;   How He Who bore in Heaven the second name   Had not on earth whereon to lay His head;   How His first followers and servants sped;   The precepts sage they wrote to many a land;   How he, who lone in Patmos banishèd,   Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand,   And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by Heaven's command.
10161-8{_}3373{_}Then kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King,   The saint, the father, and the husband prays;   Hope 'springs exulting on triumphant wing,'   That thus they all shall meet in future days,   There ever bask in uncreated rays,   No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,   Together hymning their Creator's praise,   In such society, yet still more dear,   While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere.
10161-8{_}3374{_}Compared with this, how poor Religion's pride,   In all the pomp of method and of art,   When men display to congregations wide   Devotion's ev'ry grace except the heart!
10161-8{_}3375{_}The Power, incensed, the pageant will desert,   The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;   But haply, in some cottage far apart,   May hear, well pleased, the language of the soul,   And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enroll.
10161-8{_}3376{_}Then homeward all take off their several way;   The youngling cottagers retire to rest;   The parent-pair their secret homage pay,   And proffer up to Heaven the warm request   And He who stills the raven's clamorous nest,   And decks the lily fair in flowery pride,   Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,   For them and for their little ones provide,   But chiefly in their hearts with grace divine preside.
10161-8{_}3377{_}From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,   That makes her loved at home, revered abroad:   Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,   'An honest man's the noblest work of God.'
10161-8{_}3378{_}And certes in fair virtue's heavenly road,   The cottage leaves the palace far behind:   What is a lordling's pomp?
10161-8{_}3379{_}a cumbrous load,   Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,   Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refined!
10161-8{_}3380{_}O Scotia!
10161-8{_}3381{_}my dear, my native soil!
10161-8{_}3382{_}For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent!
10161-8{_}3383{_}Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil   Be blest with health and peace and sweet content!
10161-8{_}3384{_}And O may Heaven their simple lives prevent   From luxury's contagion, weak and vile!
10161-8{_}3385{_}Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent,   A virtuous populace may rise the while,   And stand a wall of fire around their much-loved isle.
10161-8{_}3386{_}O Thou, Who poured the patriotic tide   That streamed thro' Wallace's undaunted heart,   Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride,   Or nobly die, the second glorious part!
10161-8{_}3387{_}(The patriot's God peculiarly Thou art,   His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!)
10161-8{_}3388{_}Oh never, never Scotia's realm desert,   But still the patriot and the patriot-bard   In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard!
10161-8{_}3389{_}TO A MOUSE    ON TURNING HER UP IN HER NEST WITH THE PLOUGH,   NOVEMBER, 1785    Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,   O what a panic's in thy breastie!

10161-8{_}3398{_}An' naething now to big a new ane,   O' foggage green!
10161-8{_}3399{_}An' bleak December's win's ensuin,   Baith snell an' keen!
10161-8{_}3400{_}Thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste,   An' weary winter comin fast,   An' cozie here, beneath the blast,   Thou thought to dwell--   Till, crash!
10161-8{_}3401{_}the cruel coulter passed   Out thro' thy cell.
10161-8{_}3402{_}That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble   Has cost thee monie a weary nibble!
10161-8{_}3403{_}Now thou's turned out, for a' thy trouble,   But house or hald,   To thole the winter's sleety dribble,   An' cranreuch cauld!
10161-8{_}3404{_}But mousie, thou art no thy lane   In proving foresight may be vain:   The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men   Gang aft agley,   An' lea'e us naught but grief an' pain   For promised joy!
10161-8{_}3405{_}Still, thou art bleat compared wi' me!
10161-8{_}3406{_}The present only toucheth thee:   But och!
10161-8{_}3407{_}I backward cast my e'e,   On prospects drear!
10161-8{_}3408{_}An' forward, tho' I canna see,   I guess an' fear!
10161-8{_}3409{_}TO A MOUNTAIN DAISY    ON TURNING ONE DOWN WITH THE PLOUGH IN APRIL, 1786    Wee, modest, crimson-tippèd flow'r,   Thou's met me in an evil hour,   For I maun crush amang the stoure   Thy slender stem;   To spare thee now is past my pow'r,   Thou bonie gem.
10161-8{_}3410{_}Alas!
10161-8{_}3411{_}it's no thy neebor sweet,   The bonie lark, companion meet,   Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet,   Wi' spreckled breast,   When upward springing, blythe, to greet   The purpling east.
10161-8{_}3412{_}Cauld blew the bitter-biting north   Upon thy early, humble birth;   Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth   Amid the storm,   Scarce reared above the parent-earth   Thy tender form.
10161-8{_}3413{_}The flaunting flow'rs our gardens yield,   High shelt'ring woods and wa's maun shield;   But thou, beneath the random bield   O' clod or stane,   Adorns the histie stibble-field,   Unseen, alane.
10161-8{_}3414{_}There, in thy scanty mantle clad,   Thy snawie bosom sunward spread,   Thou lifts thy unassuming head   In humble guise;   But now the share uptears thy bed,   And low thou lies!
10161-8{_}3415{_}Such is the fate of artless maid,   Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!
10161-8{_}3416{_}By love's simplicity betray'd,   And guileless trust,   Till she, like thee, all soiled is laid,   Low i' the dust.
10161-8{_}3417{_}Such is the fate of simple bard,   On life's rough ocean luckless starred!
10161-8{_}3418{_}Unskilful he to note the card   Of prudent lore,   Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,   And whelm him o'er!
10161-8{_}3419{_}Such fate to suffering worth is giv'n,   Who long with wants and woes has striv'n,   By human pride or cunning driv'n   To mis'ry's brink;   Till, wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n,   He, ruined, sink!
10161-8{_}3420{_}Ev'n thou who mourn'st the daisy's fate,   That fate is thine--no distant date;   Stern Ruin's plough-share drives, elate,   Full on thy bloom,   Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight   Shall be thy doom!
10161-8{_}3421{_}EPISTLE TO A YOUNG FRIEND    I lang hae thought, my youthfu' friend   A something to have sent you,   Tho' it should serve nae ither end   Than just a kind memento.
10161-8{_}3422{_}But how the subject-theme may gang,   Let time and chance determine;   Perhaps it may turn out a sang,   Perhaps turn out a sermon.
10161-8{_}3423{_}Ye'll try the world soon, my lad;   And, Andrew dear, believe me,   Ye'll find mankind an unco squad,   And muckle they may grieve ye:   For care and trouble set your thought,   Ev'n when your end's attainèd;   And a' your views may come to nought,   Where ev'ry nerve is strainèd.
10161-8{_}3424{_}I'll no say men are villains a';   The real, harden'd wicked,   Wha hae nae check but human law,   Are to a few restricket;   But, och!
10161-8{_}3425{_}mankind are unco weak,   An' little to be trusted;   If self the wavering balance shake,   It's rarely right adjusted!
10161-8{_}3426{_}Yet they wha fa' in fortune's strife,   Their fate we shouldna censure,   For still th' important end of life   They equally may answer;   A man may hae an honest heart,   Tho' poortith hourly stare him;   A man may tak a neebor's part,   Yet hae nae cash to spare him.
10161-8{_}3427{_}Aye free, aff-han', your story tell,   When wi a bosom crony;   But still keep something to yoursel   Ye scarcely tell to ony.
10161-8{_}3428{_}Conceal yoursel as weel's ye can   Frae critical dissection;   But keek thro' ev'ry other man,   Wi' sharpen'd, sly inspection.
10161-8{_}3429{_}The sacred lowe o' weel-placed love,   Luxuriantly indulge it;   But never tempt th' illicit rove,   Tho' naething should divulge it;   I ware the quantum o' the sin,   The hazard of concealing;   But, och!
10161-8{_}3430{_}it hardens a' within,   And petrifies the feeling!
10161-8{_}3431{_}To catch dame Fortune's golden smile,   Assiduous wait upon her;   And gather gear by ev'ry wile   That's justified by honour;   Not for to hide it in a hedge,   Nor for a train attendant;   But for the glorious privilege   Of being independent.
10161-8{_}3432{_}The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip,   To haud the wretch in order;   But where ye feel your honour grip,   Let that aye be your border;   Its slightest touches, instant pause;--   Debar a' side-pretences;   And resolutely keep its laws,   Uncaring consequences.
10161-8{_}3433{_}The great Creator to revere,   Must sure become the creature;   But still the preaching cant forbear,   And ev'n the rigid feature;   Yet ne'er with wits profane to range,   Be complaisance extended;   An atheist-laugh's a poor exchange   For Deity offended!
10161-8{_}3434{_}When ranting round in pleasure's ring,   Religion may be blinded;   Or, if she gie a random sting,   It may be little minded;   But when on life we're tempest-driv'n--   A conscience but a canker,   A correspondence fix'd wi' Heav'n   Is sure a noble anchor!

10161-8{_}3439{_}A BARD'S EPITAPH    Is there a whim-inspirèd fool,   Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule,   Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool?

10161-8{_}3441{_}Is there a bard of rustic song,   Who, noteless, steals the crowds among,   That weekly this area throng?--   Oh, pass not by!

10161-8{_}3443{_}Is there a man whose judgment clear   Can others teach the course to steer,   Yet runs himself life's mad career   Wild as the wave?--   Here pause--and thro' the starting tear   Survey this grave.
10161-8{_}3444{_}The poor inhabitant below   Was quick to learn and wise to know,   And keenly felt the friendly glow   And softer flame;   But thoughtless follies laid him low,   And stain'd his name!

10161-8{_}3448{_}Whase life is like a weel-gaun mill,   Supplied wi' store o' water,   The heapet happer's ebbing still,   And still the clap plays clatter,--    Hear me, ye venerable core,   As counsel for poor mortals   That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door   For glaikit Folly's portals;   I for their thoughtless, careless sakes   Would here propone defences--   Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes,   Their failings and mischances.
10161-8{_}3449{_}Ye see your state wi' theirs compar'd,   And shudder at the niffer;   But cast a moment's fair regard,   What maks the mighty differ?

10161-8{_}3453{_}Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames,   Tied up in godly laces,   Before ye gie poor Frailty names,   Suppose a change o' cases:   A dear-lov'd lad, convenience snug,   A treach'rous inclination--   But, let me whisper i' your lug,   Ye're aiblins nae temptation.
10161-8{_}3454{_}Then gently scan your brother man,   Still gentler sister woman;   Tho' they may gang a kennin wrang,   To step aside is human:   One point must still be greatly dark,   The moving _why_ they do it;   And just as lamely can ye mark   How far perhaps they rue it.
10161-8{_}3455{_}Who made the heart, 'tis He alone   Decidedly can try us;   He knows each chord, its various tone,   Each spring, its various bias:   Then at the balance, let's be mute,   We never can adjust it;   What's done we partly may compute,   But know not what's resisted.

10161-8{_}3509{_}TAM O' SHANTER: A TALE    Of Brownyis and of Bogillis full is this buke.
10161-8{_}3510{_}--GAWIN DOUGLAS.
10161-8{_}3511{_}When chapman billies leave the street,   And drouthy neebors neebors meet,   As market-days are wearing late,   An' folk begin to tak the gate,   While we sit bousing at the nappy,   An' getting fou and unco happy,   We think na on the lang Scots miles,   The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,   That lie between us and our hame,   Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame,   Gathering her brows like gathering storm,   Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.
10161-8{_}3512{_}This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter,   As he frae Ayr ae night did canter   (Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses   For honest men and bonie lasses).
10161-8{_}3513{_}O Tam, had'st thou but been sae wise   As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice!
10161-8{_}3514{_}She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,   A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum,   That frae November till October   Ae market-day thou was nae sober;   That ilka melder wi' the miller   Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;   That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on   The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;   That at the Lord's house, even on Sunday,   Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday.
10161-8{_}3515{_}She prophesied that, late or soon,   Thou would be found deep drowned in Doon,   Or catched wi' warlocks in the mirk   By Alloway's auld, haunted kirk.
10161-8{_}3516{_}Ah, gentle dames, it gars me greet   To think how monie counsels sweet,   How monie lengthened, sage advices,   The husband frae the wife despises!
10161-8{_}3517{_}But to our tale.
10161-8{_}3518{_}Ae market-night   Tam had got planted unco right,   Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,   Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely;   And at his elbow, Souter Johnie,   His ancient, trusty, drouthy cronie:   Tam lo'ed him like a very brither;   They had been fou for weeks thegither.
10161-8{_}3519{_}The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter,   And ay the ale was growing better;   The landlady and Tam grew gracious,   Wi' secret favours, sweet and precious;   The souter tauld his queerest stories,   The landlord's laugh was ready chorus;   The storm without might rair and rustle,   Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.
10161-8{_}3520{_}Care, mad to see a man sae happy,   E'en drowned himself amang the nappy.
10161-8{_}3521{_}As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,   The minutes winged their way wi' pleasure:   Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,   O'er a' the ills o' life victorious!
10161-8{_}3522{_}But pleasures are like poppies spread--   You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;   Or like the snow falls in the river,   A moment white--then melts forever;   Or like the borealis race,   That flit ere you can point their place;   Or like the rainbow's lovely form,   Evanishing amid the storm.
10161-8{_}3523{_}Nae man can tether time or tide:   The hour approaches Tam maun ride;   That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane,   That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in,   And sic a night he taks the road in   As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.
10161-8{_}3524{_}The wind blew as 't wad blawn its last:   The rattling showers rose on the blast;   The speedy gleams the darkness swallowed;   Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellowed:   That night, a child might understand,   The Deil had business on his hand.
10161-8{_}3525{_}Weel-mounted on his gray mare Meg,   A better never lifted leg,   Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire,   Despising wind and rain and fire;   Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet,   Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet,   While glow'ring round wi' prudent cares,   Lest bogles catch him unawares:   Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,   Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.
10161-8{_}3526{_}By this time he was cross the ford,   Whare in the snaw the chapman smoored;   And past the birks and meikle stane,   Whare drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane;   And thro' the whins and by the cairn,   Whare hunters fand the murdered bairn;   And near the thorn, aboon the well,   Whare Mungo's mither hanged hersel.
10161-8{_}3527{_}Before him Doon pours all his floods;   The doubling storm roars thro' the woods;   The lightnings flash from pole to pole;   Near and more near the thunders roll;   When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees,   Kirk-Alloway seemed in a bleeze:   Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing,   And loud resounded mirth and dancing.
10161-8{_}3528{_}Inspiring bold John Barleycorn,   What dangers thou canst make us scorn!
10161-8{_}3529{_}Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil;   Wi' usquebae, we'll face the Devil!
10161-8{_}3530{_}The swats sae reamed in Tammie's noddle,   Fair play, he cared na deils a boddle.
10161-8{_}3531{_}But Maggie stood, right sair astonished,   Till, by the heel and hand admonished,   She ventured forward on the light;   And, vow!
10161-8{_}3532{_}Tam saw an unco sight!
10161-8{_}3533{_}Warlocks and witches in a dance;   Nae cotillion, brent new frae France,   But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,   Put life and mettle in their heels.
10161-8{_}3534{_}A winnock-bunker in the east,   There sat Auld Nick, in shape o' beast;   A towsie tyke, black, grim, and large,   To gie them music was his charge:   He screwed the pipes and gart them skirl,   Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.
10161-8{_}3535{_}Coffins stood round, like open presses,   That shawed the dead in their last dresses,   And, by some devilish cantraip sleight,   Each in its cauld hand held a light:   By which heroic Tam was able   To note, upon the haly table,   A murderer's banes, in gibbet-airns;   Twa span-lang, wee, unchristened bairns;   A thief, new-cutted frae a rape--   Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape;   Five tomahawks, wi' bluid red-rusted;   Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted;   A garter which a babe had strangled;   A knife a father's throat had mangled,   Whom, his ain son o' life bereft--   The grey-hairs yet stack to the heft;   Wi' mair of horrible and awfu',   Which even to name wad be unlawfu'.
10161-8{_}3536{_}As Tammie glowered, amazed and curious,   The mirth and fun grew fast and furious:   The piper loud and louder blew,   The dancers quick and quicker flew;   They reeled, they set, they crossed, they cleekit,   Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,   And coost her duddies to the wark,   And linket at it in her sark!
10161-8{_}3537{_}Now Tam, O Tam!
10161-8{_}3538{_}had thae been queans,   A' plump and strapping in their teens!
10161-8{_}3539{_}Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen,   Been snaw-white seventeen-hunder linen!
10161-8{_}3540{_}Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,   That ance were plush, o' guid blue hair,   I wad hae gi'en them off my hurdies,   For ae blink o' the bonie burdies!
10161-8{_}3541{_}But withered beldams, auld and droll,   Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,   Louping and flinging on a crummock,   I wonder didna turn thy stomach!
10161-8{_}3542{_}But Tam kend what was what fu' brawlie:   There was ae winsome wench and wawlie,   That night enlisted in the core,   Lang after kend on Carrick shore   (For monie a beast to dead she shot,   An' perished monie a bonie boat,   And shook baith meikle corn and bear,   And kept the country-side in fear).
10161-8{_}3543{_}Her cutty sark, o' Paisley harn,   That while a lassie she had worn,   In longitude tho' sorely scanty,   It was her best, and she was vauntie.--   Ah, little kend thy reverend grannie   That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,   Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches),   Wad ever graced a dance o' witches!
10161-8{_}3544{_}But here my Muse her wing maun cour;   Sic flights are far beyond her power:   To sing how Nannie lap and flang   (A souple jad she was and strang),   And how Tam stood like ane bewitched,   And thought his very een enriched.
10161-8{_}3545{_}Even Satan glowered and fidged fu' fain,   And hotched and blew wi' might and main;   Till first ae caper, syne anither,   Tam tint his reason a' thegither,   And roars out, 'Weel done, Cutty-sark!'
10161-8{_}3546{_}And in an instant all was dark;   And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,   When out the hellish legion sallied.
10161-8{_}3547{_}As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,   When plundering herds assail their byke;   As open pussie's mortal foes,   When, pop!
10161-8{_}3548{_}she starts before their nose;   As eager runs the market-crowd,   When 'Catch the thief' resounds aloud;   So Maggie runs, the witches follow,   Wi' monie an eldritch skriech and hollo.
10161-8{_}3549{_}Ah, Tam!
10161-8{_}3550{_}ah, Tam!
10161-8{_}3551{_}thou'll get thy fairin!
10161-8{_}3552{_}In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin!
10161-8{_}3553{_}In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin!
10161-8{_}3554{_}Kate soon will be a woefu' woman!
10161-8{_}3555{_}Now do thy speedy utmost, Meg,   And win the key-stane of the brig;   There at them thou thy tail may toss--   A running stream they dare na cross!
10161-8{_}3556{_}But ere the key-stane she could make,   The fient a tail she had to shake!
10161-8{_}3557{_}For Nannie, far before the rest,   Hard upon noble Maggie prest,   And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;   But little wist she Maggie's mettle!
10161-8{_}3558{_}Ae spring brought off her master hale,   But left behind her ain grey tail:   The carlin claught her by the rump,   And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.
10161-8{_}3559{_}Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,   Ilk man and mother's son, take heed:   Whene'er to drink you are inclined,   Or cutty sarks run in your mind,   Think ye may buy the joys o'er dear;   Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare.
10161-8{_}3560{_}AE FOND KISS    Ae fond kiss, and then we sever!
10161-8{_}3561{_}Ae farewell, and then forever!

10161-8{_}3655{_}now the direful monster, whose skin clings   To his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks:   He withers all in silence, and in his hand   Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life.

10161-8{_}3669{_}'Piper, pipe that song again;'   So I piped: he wept to hear.
10161-8{_}3670{_}'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;   Sing thy songs of happy cheer:'   So I sang the same again,   While he wept with joy to hear.
10161-8{_}3671{_}'Piper, sit thee down and write   In a book, that all may read.'
10161-8{_}3672{_}So he vanished from my sight,   And I plucked a hollow reed,    And I made a rural pen,   And I stained the water clear,   And I wrote my happy songs   Every child may joy to hear.

10161-8{_}3683{_}THE LITTLE BLACK BOY    My mother bore me in the southern wild,   And I am black, but O!
10161-8{_}3684{_}my soul is white;   White as an angel is the English child,   But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
10161-8{_}3685{_}My mother taught me underneath a tree,   And, sitting down before the heat of day,   She took me on her lap and kissèd me,   And, pointing to the east, began to say:    'Look on the rising sun,--there God does live,   And gives His light, and gives His heat away;   And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive   Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.
10161-8{_}3686{_}'And we are put on earth a little space,   That we may learn to bear the beams of love;   And these black bodies and this sunburnt face   Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
10161-8{_}3687{_}'For when our souls have learned the heat to bear,   The cloud will vanish; we shall hear His voice,   Saying: "Come out from the grove, my love and care.
10161-8{_}3688{_}And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice."'
10161-8{_}3689{_}Thus did my mother say, and kissèd me;   And thus I say to little English boy.
10161-8{_}3690{_}When I from black and he from white cloud free,   And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,    I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear   To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;   And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,   And be like him, and he will then love me.

10161-8{_}3729{_}Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod,   Or Love in a golden bowl?_    I    The daughters of [the] Seraphim led round their sunny flocks--   All but the youngest: she in paleness sought the secret air,   To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:   Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard,   And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew:--    'O life of this our spring!
10161-8{_}3730{_}why fades the lotus of the water?
10161-8{_}3731{_}Why fade these children of the spring, born but to smile and fall?
10161-8{_}3732{_}Ah!
10161-8{_}3733{_}Thel is like a watery bow, and like a parting cloud;   Like a reflection in a glass; like shadows in the water;   Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infant's face;   Like the dove's voice; like transient day; like music in the air.
10161-8{_}3734{_}Ah!
10161-8{_}3735{_}gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my head,   And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gentle hear the voice   Of Him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.'
10161-8{_}3736{_}The Lily of the Valley, breathing in the humble grass,   Answerèd the lovely maid and said: 'I am a wat'ry weed,   And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales;   So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head.
10161-8{_}3737{_}Yet I am visited from heaven, and He that smiles on all   Walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads His hand,   Saying, "Rejoice, thou humble grass, thou new-born lily flower,   Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks;   For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna,   Till summer's heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs,   To flourish in eternal vales."
10161-8{_}3738{_}Then why should Thel complain?
10161-8{_}3739{_}Why should the mistress of the vales of Har utter a sigh?'
10161-8{_}3740{_}She ceased, and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.
10161-8{_}3741{_}Thel answered: 'O thou little Virgin of the peaceful valley,   Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'er-tired;   Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments,   He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face,   Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.
10161-8{_}3742{_}Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume,   Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs,   Revives the milkèd cow, and tames the fire-breathing steed.
10161-8{_}3743{_}But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:   I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?'
10161-8{_}3744{_}'Queen of the vales,' the Lily answered, 'ask the tender Cloud,   And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky,   And why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air.
10161-8{_}3745{_}Descend, O little Cloud, and hover before the eyes of Thel.'
10161-8{_}3746{_}The Cloud descended, and the Lily bowèd her modest head,   And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.
10161-8{_}3747{_}II    'O little Cloud,' the Virgin said, I charge thee tell to me   Why thou complainest not, when in one hour thou fade away;   Then we shall seek thee, but not find.
10161-8{_}3748{_}Ah!
10161-8{_}3749{_}Thel is like to thee:   I pass away; yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.'
10161-8{_}3750{_}The Cloud then showed his golden head, and his bright form emerged,   Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.
10161-8{_}3751{_}'O Virgin, know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs   Where Luvah doth renew his horses?
10161-8{_}3752{_}Look'st thou on my youth,   And fearest thou, because I vanish and am seen no more,   Nothing remains?
10161-8{_}3753{_}O maid, I tell thee, when I pass away,   It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:   Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers,   And court the fair-eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent:   The weeping virgin, trembling, kneels before the risen sun,   Till we arise, linked in a golden band and never part,   But walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers.'
10161-8{_}3754{_}'Dost thou, O little Cloud?
10161-8{_}3755{_}I fear that I am not like thee,   For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers,   But I feed not the little flowers; I hear the warbling birds,   But I feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their food:   But Thel delights in these no more, because I fade away;   And all shall say, "Without a use this shining woman lived,   Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms?"'
10161-8{_}3756{_}The Cloud reclined upon his airy throne, and answered thus:--    'Then if thou art the food of worms, O Virgin of the skies,   How great thy use, how great thy blessing!
10161-8{_}3757{_}Everything that lives   Lives not alone nor for itself.
10161-8{_}3758{_}Fear not, and I will call   The weak Worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.
10161-8{_}3759{_}Come forth, Worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive Queen.'
10161-8{_}3760{_}The helpless Worm arose, and sat upon the Lily's leaf,   And the bright Cloud sailed on, to find his partner in the vale.
10161-8{_}3761{_}III    Then Thel astonished viewed the Worm upon its dewy bed.
10161-8{_}3762{_}'Art thou a Worm?
10161-8{_}3763{_}Image of weakness, art thou but a Worm?
10161-8{_}3764{_}I see thee like an infant wrappèd in the Lily's leaf.
10161-8{_}3765{_}Ah!
10161-8{_}3766{_}weep not, little voice, thou canst not speak, but thou canst weep.
10161-8{_}3767{_}Is this a Worm?
10161-8{_}3768{_}I see thee lay helpless and naked, weeping,   And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's smiles.'
10161-8{_}3769{_}The Clod of Clay heard the Worm's voice, and raised her pitying head;   She bowed over the weeping infant, and her life exhaled   In milky fondness: then on Thel she fixed her humble eyes.
10161-8{_}3770{_}'O Beauty of the vales of Har!
10161-8{_}3771{_}we live not for ourselves.
10161-8{_}3772{_}Thou seest me, the meanest thing, and so I am indeed.
10161-8{_}3773{_}My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark;   But He that loves the lowly pours His oil upon my head,   And kisses me, and binds His nuptial bands around my breast,   And says: "Thou mother of my children, I have lovèd thee,   And I have given thee a crown that none can take away."
10161-8{_}3774{_}But how this is, sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know;    I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.'
10161-8{_}3775{_}The daughter of beauty wiped her pitying tears with her white veil,   And said: 'Alas!
10161-8{_}3776{_}I knew not this, and therefore did I weep.
10161-8{_}3777{_}That God would love a worm I knew, and punish the evil foot   That wilful bruised its helpless form; but that He cherished it   With milk and oil, I never knew, and therefore did I weep;   And I complained in the mild air, because I fade away,   And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.'
10161-8{_}3778{_}'Queen of the vales,' the matron Clay answered, 'I heard thy sighs,   And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have called them down.
10161-8{_}3779{_}Wilt thou, O queen, enter my house?
10161-8{_}3780{_}'Tis given thee to enter,   And to return: fear nothing; enter with thy virgin feet.'
10161-8{_}3781{_}IV    The eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern bar;   Thel entered in, and saw the secrets of the land unknown.
10161-8{_}3782{_}She saw the couches of the dead, and where the fibrous root   Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:   A land of sorrows and of tears where never smile was seen.
10161-8{_}3783{_}She wandered in the land of clouds through valleys dark, listening   Dolours and lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave   She stood in silence, listening to the voices of the ground,   Till to her own grave-plot she came, and there she sat down,   And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
10161-8{_}3784{_}'Why cannot the ear be closèd to its own destruction?
10161-8{_}3785{_}Or the glistening eye to the poison of a smile?
10161-8{_}3786{_}Why are eyelids stored with arrows ready drawn,   Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie,   Or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and coinèd gold?
10161-8{_}3787{_}Why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind?
10161-8{_}3788{_}Why an ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?
10161-8{_}3789{_}Why a nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, and affright?
10161-8{_}3790{_}Why a tender curb upon the youthful, burning boy?
10161-8{_}3791{_}Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?'
10161-8{_}3792{_}The Virgin started from her seat, and with a shriek   Fled back unhindered till she came into the vales of Har.
10161-8{_}3793{_}From THE FRENCH REVOLUTION    [DEMOCRACY AND PEACE]    Aumont went out and stood in the hollow porch, his ivory wand in his      hand;   A cold orb of disdain revolved round him, and coverèd his soul with      snows eternal.
10161-8{_}3794{_}Great Henry's soul shudderèd, a whirlwind and fire tore furious from      his angry bosom;   He indignant departed on horses of Heaven.
10161-8{_}3795{_}Then the Abbé de Sieyès      raised his feet   On the steps of the Louvre; like a voice of God following a storm,      the Abbé followed   The pale fires of Aumont into the chamber; as a father that bows to      his son,   Whose rich fields inheriting spread their old glory, so the voice of      the people bowèd   Before the ancient seat of the kingdom and mountains to be renewèd.

10161-8{_}3806{_}Then the Priest in his      thunderous cloud   Shall weep, bending to earth, embracing the valleys, and putting his      hand to the plough,   Shall say, "No more I curse thee; but now I will bless thee: no more in      deadly black   Devour thy labour; nor lift up a cloud in thy heavens, O laborious      plough;   That the wild raging millions, that wander in forests, and howl in      law-blasted wastes,   Strength maddened with slavery, honesty bound in the dens of      superstition,   May sing in the village, and shout in the harvest, and woo in pleasant      gardens   Their once savage loves, now beaming with knowledge, with gentle awe      adornèd;   And the saw, and the hammer, the chisel, the pencil, the pen, and the      instruments   Of heavenly song sound in the wilds once forbidden, to teach the      laborious ploughman   And shepherd, delivered from clouds of war, from pestilence, from      night-fear, from murder,   From falling, from stifling, from hunger, from cold, from slander,      discontent, and sloth,   That walk in beasts and birds of night, driven back by the sandy desert,   Like pestilent fogs round cities of men; and the happy earth sing in its      course,   The mild peaceable nations be openèd to heaven, and men walk with their      fathers in bliss."
10161-8{_}3807{_}Then hear the first voice of the morning: "Depart, O clouds of night,      and no more   Return; be withdrawn cloudy war, troops of warriors depart, nor around      our peaceable city   Breathe fires; but ten miles from Paris let all be peace, nor a soldier      be seen!"'

10161-8{_}4749{_}Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
10161-8{_}4750{_}In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

10161-8{_}4760{_}Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
10161-8{_}4761{_}Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
10161-8{_}4762{_}The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
10161-8{_}4763{_}Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
10161-8{_}4764{_}We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
10161-8{_}4765{_}To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
10161-8{_}4766{_}International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
10161-8{_}4767{_}U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

10161-8{_}4769{_}Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

10161-8{_}4771{_}General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
10161-8{_}4772{_}Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
10161-8{_}4773{_}For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
10161-8{_}4774{_}Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
10161-8{_}4775{_}Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
10161-8{_}4776{_}Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
10161-8{_}4777{_}Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
10161-8{_}4778{_}The replaced older file is renamed.
10161-8{_}4779{_}VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.
10161-8{_}4780{_}Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
10161-8{_}4781{_}EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.
10161-8{_}4782{_}If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.
10161-8{_}4783{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.
10161-8{_}4784{_}The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.
10161-8{_}4785{_}The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).
10161-8{_}4786{_}The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.
10161-8{_}4787{_}For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689  An alternative method of locating eBooks:      http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL
