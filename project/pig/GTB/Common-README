Common-RE{_}16{_}Release Date: February, 2002  [Etext #3057]

Edition: 10

Language: English

The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Common Edition: New Testament
******This file should be named comed10.txt or comed10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, comed11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, comed10a.txt

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Common-RE{_}17{_}Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.
Common-RE{_}18{_}Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
Common-RE{_}19{_}The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.
Common-RE{_}20{_}A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.
Common-RE{_}21{_}Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg

Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
Common-RE{_}22{_}http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

Or /etext01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.
Common-RE{_}23{_}Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
Common-RE{_}24{_}The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
Common-RE{_}25{_}This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
Common-RE{_}26{_}If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
Common-RE{_}27{_}The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.
Common-RE{_}28{_}[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
Common-RE{_}29{_}At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.
Common-RE{_}30{_}We need your donations more than ever!
Common-RE{_}31{_}Presently, contributions are only being solicted from people in:
Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota,
Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont.
