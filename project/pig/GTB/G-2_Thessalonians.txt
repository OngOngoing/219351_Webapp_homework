G-2_Thessalonians{_}1{_}The Second Letter  of Paul to The  Thessalonians  1 	1 Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the  Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 2 grace and  peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}2{_}3 We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is  fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every  one of you for one another is increasing.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}3{_}4 Therefore we ourselves boast  of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all  your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}4{_}5 This is  evidence of God's righteous judgment, so that you will be considered  worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}5{_}6 For  after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict  you, 7 and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when  the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in  flaming fire, 8 inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and  on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}6{_}9 They will suffer  the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of  the Lord and from the glory of his power, 10 when he comes to be  glorified in his saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who  have believedbecause our testimony to you was believed.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}7{_}11 To this  end we always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his  calling, and may fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by his power,  12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in  him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}8{_}2 	1 Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our  gathering together to him, we beg you, brethren, 2 not to be quickly  shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter as if  from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}9{_}3 Let no one  deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion  comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of  destruction, 4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god  or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God,  proclaiming himself to be God.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}10{_}5 Do you not remember that when I was  still with you I told you these things?
G-2_Thessalonians{_}11{_}6 And you know what restrains him  now, so that in his time he may be revealed.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}12{_}7 For the mystery of  lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until  he is taken out of the way.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}13{_}8 And then the lawless one will be revealed,  whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy  by the splendor of his coming.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}14{_}9 The coming of the lawless one by the  activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and  wonders, 10 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are  to perish, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}15{_}11 For  this reason God sends upon them a strong delusion so that they will  believe what is false, 12 so that all may be condemned who did not  believe the truth but had pleasure in wickedness.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}16{_}13 But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you,  brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning  to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}17{_}14  He called you to this through our gospel, that you may share in the glory  of our Lord Jesus Christ.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}18{_}15 So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the  traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter  from us.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}19{_}16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father,  who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, 17  comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}20{_}3 	1 Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may  spread rapidly and be honored, just as it did also with you, 2 and that we  may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}21{_}3 But  the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil  one.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}22{_}4 And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing  and will continue to do the things which we command.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}23{_}5 May the Lord  direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of  Christ.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}24{_}6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord  Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who is living in  idleness and not according to the tradition which you received from us.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}25{_}7  For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}26{_}We were  not idle when we were with you, 8 nor did we eat anyone's bread without  paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so  that we would not be a burden to any of you.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}27{_}9 We did this, not because  we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves an  example for you to follow.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}28{_}10 For even when we were with you, we gave  you this rule: "If anyone will not work, he shall not eat."
G-2_Thessalonians{_}29{_}11 For we hear  that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, not doing any  work at all, but acting like busybodies.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}30{_}12 Now such persons we  command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion  and earn their own bread to eat.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}31{_}13 But as for you, brethren, do not grow  weary of doing good.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}32{_}14 If anyone does not obey our instruction in this  letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so  that he may be ashamed.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}33{_}15 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn  him as a brother.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}34{_}16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all  times in every way.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}35{_}The Lord be with you all.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}36{_}17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}37{_}This is a  distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
G-2_Thessalonians{_}38{_}18 The grace of  our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
