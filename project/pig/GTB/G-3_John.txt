G-3_John{_}1{_}The Third Letter of  John  1 	1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
G-3_John{_}2{_}2 Beloved, I pray that you may be in good health and that all may  go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
G-3_John{_}3{_}3 For I greatly  rejoiced when some of the brethren arrived and testified to the truth of  your life, and how you are walking in truth.
G-3_John{_}4{_}4 I have no greater joy than  this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
G-3_John{_}5{_}5 Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish  for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers; 6 and they have  testified to your love before the church.
G-3_John{_}6{_}You will do well to send them on  their way in a manner worthy of God.
G-3_John{_}7{_}7 For they went out for the sake of  the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
G-3_John{_}8{_}8 Therefore we ought to  support such men, so that we may be fellow workers in the truth.
G-3_John{_}9{_}9 I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to  be first among them, does not accept what we say.
G-3_John{_}10{_}10 So if I come, I will  call attention to what he is doing, gossiping against us with evil words.
G-3_John{_}11{_}And not satisfied with that, he refuses himself to welcome the brethren,  and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the  church.
G-3_John{_}12{_}11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good.
G-3_John{_}13{_}The  one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
G-3_John{_}14{_}12  Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the  truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is  true.
G-3_John{_}15{_}13 I had much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen  and ink; 14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
G-3_John{_}16{_}Peace to  you.
G-3_John{_}17{_}The friends here send their greetings.
G-3_John{_}18{_}Greet the friends there by  name.
