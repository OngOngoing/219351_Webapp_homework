G-Hebrews{_}1{_}The Letter to the  Hebrews 1 	1 In the past God spoke to our fathers by the prophets at many  times and in various ways, 2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by  his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he  made the world.
G-Hebrews{_}2{_}3 He is the radiance of his glory and the exact  representation of his being, and upholds all things by the word of his  power.
G-Hebrews{_}3{_}When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right  hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become as much superior to angels  as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
G-Hebrews{_}4{_}5 For to which of the angels did God ever say,  	"You are my son,  		today I have begotten you"?
G-Hebrews{_}5{_}And again,  	"I will be a father to him  		and he shall be a son to me"?
G-Hebrews{_}6{_}6 And again, when God brings the first-born into the world, he says,  	"Let all God's angels worship him."
G-Hebrews{_}7{_}7 Of the angels he says,  	"Who makes his angels winds,  		and his servants flames of fire."
G-Hebrews{_}8{_}8 But of the Son he says,  	"Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever,  		and the righteous scepter  			is the scepter of your kingdom.
G-Hebrews{_}9{_}9	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;  	therefore God, your God,  		has anointed you with the oil of gladness  			above your companions."
G-Hebrews{_}10{_}10 And,  	"You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth,  		and the heavens are the work of your hands;  11	they will perish, but you remain;  		they will all grow old like a garment,  12	you will roll them up like a mantle;  		and like a garment they will be changed.
G-Hebrews{_}11{_}But you remain the same,  		and your years will never end."
G-Hebrews{_}12{_}13 But to which of the angels has he ever said,  	"Sit at my right hand,  		until I make your enemies a stool for your feet"?
G-Hebrews{_}13{_}14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to serve for the sake of  those who will inherit salvation?
G-Hebrews{_}14{_}2 	1 Therefore we must pay more careful attention to what we have  heard, lest we drift away from it.
G-Hebrews{_}15{_}2 For if the message spoken by angels  was valid, and every transgression and disobedience received a just  punishment, 3 how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
G-Hebrews{_}16{_}It  was declared at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who  heard him, 4 while God also bore witness, by signs and wonders and  various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to  his own will.
G-Hebrews{_}17{_}5 For it is not to angels that he subjected the world to come,  about which we are speaking.
G-Hebrews{_}18{_}6 But there is a place where someone has  testified,  	"What is man that you are mindful of him,  		or the son of man that you care for him?
G-Hebrews{_}19{_}7	You made him for a little while lower than the angels;  		you crowned him with glory and honor,  8	and put everything in subjection under his feet."
G-Hebrews{_}20{_}Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing that is not  subject to him.
G-Hebrews{_}21{_}As it is, we do not yet see everything subject to him.
G-Hebrews{_}22{_}9 But  we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels,  crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that  by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
G-Hebrews{_}23{_}10 For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all  things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the author of  their salvation perfect through suffering.
G-Hebrews{_}24{_}11 For both he who sanctifies  and those who are being sanctified are all of one.
G-Hebrews{_}25{_}That is why he is not  ashamed to call them brethren, 12 saying,  	"I will declare your name to my brethren,  		in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
G-Hebrews{_}26{_}13 And again,  	"I will put my trust in him."
G-Hebrews{_}27{_}And again,  	"Here am I, and the children God has given me."
G-Hebrews{_}28{_}14 Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself  likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy  him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 and might free those  who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
G-Hebrews{_}29{_}16 For  surely it is not with angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants  of Abraham.
G-Hebrews{_}30{_}17 Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every  respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the  service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
G-Hebrews{_}31{_}18 For  because he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those  who are tempted.
G-Hebrews{_}32{_}3 	1 Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly calling,  consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
G-Hebrews{_}33{_}2 He was  faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all  God's house.
G-Hebrews{_}34{_}3 Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory  than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house.
G-Hebrews{_}35{_}4  For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
G-Hebrews{_}36{_}5 Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the  things that were to be spoken later, 6 but Christ is faithful as a son over  God's house.
G-Hebrews{_}37{_}And we are his house, if we hold fast to our confidence and  the hope of which we boast.
G-Hebrews{_}38{_}7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:  	"Today, if you will hear his voice,  8	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,  		on the day of testing in the wilderness,  9	where your fathers put me to the test  		and saw my works for forty years.
G-Hebrews{_}39{_}10	Therefore I was angry with that generation,  	and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts;  		and they have not known my ways.'
G-Hebrews{_}40{_}11	As I swore in my wrath,  		'They shall never enter my rest.'"
G-Hebrews{_}41{_}12 Take care, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil,  unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
G-Hebrews{_}42{_}13 But  exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "Today," so that none  of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
G-Hebrews{_}43{_}14 For we have come  to share in Christ if we hold our first confidence firm to the end, 15 while  it is said,  	"Today, if you will hear his voice,  		do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
G-Hebrews{_}44{_}16 Who were they who heard and rebelled?
G-Hebrews{_}45{_}Were they not all those  Moses led out of Egypt?
G-Hebrews{_}46{_}17 And with whom was he angry for forty years?
G-Hebrews{_}47{_}Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
G-Hebrews{_}48{_}18 And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, but to  those who were disobedient?
G-Hebrews{_}49{_}19 So we see that they were not able to  enter because of unbelief.
G-Hebrews{_}50{_}4 	1 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us  fear lest any one of you be judged to have come short of it.
G-Hebrews{_}51{_}2 For we also  have had the good news preached to us, just as they did; but the message  they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not  combine it with faith.
G-Hebrews{_}52{_}3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he  has said,  	"As I swore in my wrath,  	'They shall never enter my rest,'"  although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
G-Hebrews{_}53{_}4 For  he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: "And God  rested on the seventh day from all his works."
G-Hebrews{_}54{_}5 And again in this place  he said, "They shall never enter my rest."
G-Hebrews{_}55{_}6 Since therefore it remains for  some to enter it, and those who formerly had the good news preached to  them failed to enter because of disobedience, 7 God again set a certain  day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been  said before,  	"Today, if you hear his voice,  	do not harden your hearts."
G-Hebrews{_}56{_}8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later of  another day.
G-Hebrews{_}57{_}9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of  God; 10 for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work,  just as God did from his.
G-Hebrews{_}58{_}11 Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest,  so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.
G-Hebrews{_}59{_}12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any  two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints  and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
G-Hebrews{_}60{_}13  And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and  laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
G-Hebrews{_}61{_}14 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed  through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our  confession.
G-Hebrews{_}62{_}15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to  sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been  tempted as we are, yet without sin.
G-Hebrews{_}63{_}16 Let us then with confidence draw  near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to  help in time of need.
G-Hebrews{_}64{_}5 	1 For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to  act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for  sins.
G-Hebrews{_}65{_}2 He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray,  since he himself is beset with weakness.
G-Hebrews{_}66{_}3 Because of this he has to offer  sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.
G-Hebrews{_}67{_}4 And no  one takes the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron  was.
G-Hebrews{_}68{_}5 So also Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest,  but it was he who said to him,  	"You are my son,  		today I have begotten you";  6 as he says also in another place,  	"You are a priest forever,  		after the order of Melchizedek."
G-Hebrews{_}69{_}7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with  loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and  he was heard because of his godly fear.
G-Hebrews{_}70{_}8 Although he was a Son, he  learned obedience from what he suffered; 9 and, once made perfect, he  became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, 10 being  designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
G-Hebrews{_}71{_}11 About this we have much to say which is hard to explain,  since you have become dull of hearing.
G-Hebrews{_}72{_}12 For though by this time you  ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first  principles of God's word.
G-Hebrews{_}73{_}You need milk, not solid food; 13 for every one  who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a  babe.
G-Hebrews{_}74{_}14 But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their sense  trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.
G-Hebrews{_}75{_}6 	1 Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ  and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from  dead works, and of faith toward God, 2 with instruction about baptisms,  the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
G-Hebrews{_}76{_}3 And this we will do, if God permits.
G-Hebrews{_}77{_}4 For it is impossible for those  who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and  have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 5 and have tasted the goodness  of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, 6 and then have  fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again  for themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.
G-Hebrews{_}78{_}7 For land  which drinks the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation  useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from  God.
G-Hebrews{_}79{_}8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being  cursed; its end is to be burned.
G-Hebrews{_}80{_}9 Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are confident of  better things in your case, things that accompany salvation.
G-Hebrews{_}81{_}10 For God is  not so unjust as to forget your work and the love which you have shown  for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.
G-Hebrews{_}82{_}11 And we desire each  one of you to show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of  hope until the end, 12 so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of  those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
G-Hebrews{_}83{_}13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no  one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, 14 saying, "I will  surely bless you and multiply you."
G-Hebrews{_}84{_}15 And so Abraham, having patiently  endured, obtained the promise.
G-Hebrews{_}85{_}16 Men swear by one greater than  themselves, and in all their disputes the oath is final for confirmation.
G-Hebrews{_}86{_}17  So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the  promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an  oath, 18 so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for  God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement  to take hold of the hope set before us.
G-Hebrews{_}87{_}19 We have this as a sure and  steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner sanctuary  behind the curtain, 20 where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our  behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of  Melchizedek.
G-Hebrews{_}88{_}7 	1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High  God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed  him.
G-Hebrews{_}89{_}2 And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything.
G-Hebrews{_}90{_}He is first, by  translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of  Salem, that is, king of peace.
G-Hebrews{_}91{_}3 Without father, without mother, without  genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like  the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.
G-Hebrews{_}92{_}4 See how great he was!
G-Hebrews{_}93{_}Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a  tenth of the spoils.
G-Hebrews{_}94{_}5 And those descendants of Levi who receive the  priestly office have a commandment in the law to take a tenth from the  people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from  Abraham.
G-Hebrews{_}95{_}6 But this man whose genealogy is not derived from them  received a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
G-Hebrews{_}96{_}7  And without dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater.
G-Hebrews{_}97{_}8 In this  case tithes are received by mortal men, but in that case by one of whom it  is witnessed that he lives on.
G-Hebrews{_}98{_}9 One might even say that Levi himself, who  receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, 10 for he was still in the  loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
G-Hebrews{_}99{_}11 Now if perfection could have been through the Levitical  priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what  further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of  Melchizedek, and not one designated according to the order of Aaron?
G-Hebrews{_}100{_}12  For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change  of the law.
G-Hebrews{_}101{_}13 For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to  another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
G-Hebrews{_}102{_}14 For it is  evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in regard to that  tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
G-Hebrews{_}103{_}15 This becomes even more  evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 16 who has  become a priest not on the basis of a law of carnal requirement, but  according to the power of an indestructible life.
G-Hebrews{_}104{_}17 For it is declared of  him,  	"You are a priest forever,  		after the order of Melchizedek."
G-Hebrews{_}105{_}18 On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its  weakness and uselessness 19 (for the law made nothing perfect); and on  the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near  to God.
G-Hebrews{_}106{_}20 And it was not without an oath.
G-Hebrews{_}107{_}21 Those who formerly  became priests took their office without an oath, but he became a priest  with an oath through the One who said to him,  	"The Lord has sworn  		and will not change his mind,  	'You are a priest forever.'"
G-Hebrews{_}108{_}22 Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better  covenant.
G-Hebrews{_}109{_}23 The former priests were many in number, because they were  prevented by death from continuing in office; 24 but he holds his  priesthood forever, because he continues for ever.
G-Hebrews{_}110{_}25 Therefore he is able  also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he  always lives to make intercession for them.
G-Hebrews{_}111{_}26 For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy,  blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
G-Hebrews{_}112{_}27 He does not need, like those high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices,  first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did  this once for all when he offered up himself.
G-Hebrews{_}113{_}28 For the Law appoints  men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came  after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.
G-Hebrews{_}114{_}8 	1 Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a  high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the  Majesty in heaven, 2 a minister in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle which  is set up by the Lord, not by man.
G-Hebrews{_}115{_}3 For every high priest is appointed to  offer both gifts and sacrifices; and so it is necessary for this priest also to  have something to offer.
G-Hebrews{_}116{_}4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a  priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the  law.
G-Hebrews{_}117{_}5 They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when  Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was instructed by God,  saying, "See that you make everything according to the pattern which was  shown you on the mountain."
G-Hebrews{_}118{_}6 But as it is, he has obtained a ministry  which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates  is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
G-Hebrews{_}119{_}7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have  been no place sought for a second.
G-Hebrews{_}120{_}8 For he finds fault with them when he  says:  	"The days are coming, says the Lord,  		when I will make a new covenant  		with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;  9	not like the covenant that I made with their fathers  		on the day when I took them by the hand  			to lead them out of the land of Egypt;  	for they did not continue in my covenant,  		and so I paid no heed to them, says the Lord.
G-Hebrews{_}121{_}10	This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel  		after those days, says the Lord:  	I will put my laws into their minds,  		and I will write them on their hearts,  	and I will be their God,  		and they shall be my people.
G-Hebrews{_}122{_}11	And they shall not teach every one his fellow  		or every one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'  	for all shall know me,  		from the least of them to the greatest.
G-Hebrews{_}123{_}12	For I will be merciful to their iniquities,  		and I will remember their sins no more."
G-Hebrews{_}124{_}13 When he said, "A new covenant," he has made the first obsolete.
G-Hebrews{_}125{_}And  what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
G-Hebrews{_}126{_}9 	1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and  an earthly sanctuary.
G-Hebrews{_}127{_}2 For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first one,  in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is  called the holy place.
G-Hebrews{_}128{_}3 Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called  the Holy of Holies, 4 having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the  covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden jar  holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the  covenant; 5 and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the  mercy seat.
G-Hebrews{_}129{_}But of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
G-Hebrews{_}130{_}6 These preparations having thus been made, the priests go  continually into the outer tabernacle, performing their ritual duties.
G-Hebrews{_}131{_}7 But  into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not  without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the  people committed in ignorance.
G-Hebrews{_}132{_}8 The Holy Spirit was showing by this  that the way into the holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the  outer tabernacle was still standing.
G-Hebrews{_}133{_}9 This is symbolic for the present  time.
G-Hebrews{_}134{_}According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which  cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, 10 since they relate only  to food and drink and various washings  regulations for the flesh  imposed until the time of reformation.
G-Hebrews{_}135{_}11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things  that have come, he entered through the greater and more perfect  tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation.
G-Hebrews{_}136{_}12 He  did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but he entered  the holy place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal  redemption.
G-Hebrews{_}137{_}13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a  heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of  the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the  eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your  conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
G-Hebrews{_}138{_}15 For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, that  those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now  that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the transgressions  committed under the first covenant.
G-Hebrews{_}139{_}16 For where a will is, there must of  necessity be the death of the one who made it.
G-Hebrews{_}140{_}17 For a will is in force  only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect while the one  who made it is living.
G-Hebrews{_}141{_}18 This is why even the first covenant was not  ratified without blood.
G-Hebrews{_}142{_}19 For when every commandment of the law had  been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and  goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the  book itself and all the people, 20 saying, "This is the blood of the  covenant which God has commanded you."
G-Hebrews{_}143{_}21 And in the same way he  sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in  worship.
G-Hebrews{_}144{_}22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is cleansed with  blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
G-Hebrews{_}145{_}23 It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to  be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with  better sacrifices than these.
G-Hebrews{_}146{_}24 For Christ did not enter a holy place made  with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear  in the presence of God for us.
G-Hebrews{_}147{_}25 Nor was it that he should offer himself  again and again, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with  blood not his own.
G-Hebrews{_}148{_}26 For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly  since the foundation of the world.
G-Hebrews{_}149{_}But now, he has appeared once for all  at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
G-Hebrews{_}150{_}27 And  just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,  28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will  appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who  are eagerly waiting for him.
G-Hebrews{_}151{_}10 1 For since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not  the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which  are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near.
G-Hebrews{_}152{_}2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered?
G-Hebrews{_}153{_}If the worshipers  had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of  sins.
G-Hebrews{_}154{_}3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.
G-Hebrews{_}155{_}4  For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
G-Hebrews{_}156{_}5 Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:  	"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,  		but a body you prepared for me;  6	in burnt offerings and sin offerings  		you have taken no pleasure.
G-Hebrews{_}157{_}7	Then I said, 'Behold,  		I have come to do your will, O God,'  	as it is written of me in the roll of the book."
G-Hebrews{_}158{_}8 When he said above, "You did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in  sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are  offered according to the law), 9 then he said, "Behold, I have come to do  your will."
G-Hebrews{_}159{_}He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
G-Hebrews{_}160{_}10  And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body  of Jesus Christ once for all.
G-Hebrews{_}161{_}11 And every priest stands daily at his service, offering time after  time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
G-Hebrews{_}162{_}12 But when he  had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right  hand of God, 13 waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool  for his feet.
G-Hebrews{_}163{_}14 For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who  are sanctified.
G-Hebrews{_}164{_}15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,  16	"This is the covenant that I will make  		with them after those days, says the Lord:  	I will put my laws into their hearts,  		and in their minds I will write them,"  17 then he adds,  	"Their sins and their lawless deeds  		I will remember no more."
G-Hebrews{_}165{_}18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for  sin.
G-Hebrews{_}166{_}19 Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the  holy place by the blood of Jesus, 20 by a new and living way which he  opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh, 21 and since we have  a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart  in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil  conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
G-Hebrews{_}167{_}23 Let us hold fast  the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is  faithful; 24 and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and  good works, 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit  of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the  Day drawing near.
G-Hebrews{_}168{_}26 For if we sin deliberately after we have received the  knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but  a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume  the adversaries.
G-Hebrews{_}169{_}28 Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies  without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
G-Hebrews{_}170{_}29 How much  severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled  under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as an unclean thing the  blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the  Spirit of grace?
G-Hebrews{_}171{_}30 For we know him who said,  	"Vengeance is mine, I will repay."
G-Hebrews{_}172{_}And again,  	"The Lord will judge his people."
G-Hebrews{_}173{_}31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
G-Hebrews{_}174{_}32 But remember the former days when, after you were  enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings, 33 sometimes  being publicly exposed to insult and persecution; and at other times  standing side by side with those who were so treated.
G-Hebrews{_}175{_}34 For you had  compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of  your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession  and an abiding one.
G-Hebrews{_}176{_}35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence,  which has a great reward.
G-Hebrews{_}177{_}36 For you have need of endurance, so that  when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
G-Hebrews{_}178{_}37	"For yet in a very little while,  		he who is coming will come and will not delay.
G-Hebrews{_}179{_}38	But my righteous one shall live by faith,  		and if he shrinks back,  			my soul has no pleasure in him."
G-Hebrews{_}180{_}39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of  those who have faith and keep their souls.
G-Hebrews{_}181{_}11 	1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction  of things not seen.
G-Hebrews{_}182{_}2 For by it the men of old received divine approval.
G-Hebrews{_}183{_}3 By faith we understand that the world was created by the word  of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.
G-Hebrews{_}184{_}4 By faith Abel offered God a more acceptable sacrifice than  Cain, through which he was commended as a righteous man, when God  spoke well of his gifts.
G-Hebrews{_}185{_}And through faith he still speaks, even though he  is dead.
G-Hebrews{_}186{_}5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death;  and he was not found, because God had taken him.
G-Hebrews{_}187{_}For before he was  taken he was attested as having pleased God.
G-Hebrews{_}188{_}6 And without faith it is  impossible to please God, for anyone who comes to him must believe that  he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
G-Hebrews{_}189{_}7 By faith  Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in godly fear  prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he  condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which  comes by faith.
G-Hebrews{_}190{_}8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a  place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not  knowing where he was going.
G-Hebrews{_}191{_}9 By faith he lived in the land of promise,  as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him  of the same promise; 10 for he was looking forward to the city which has  foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
G-Hebrews{_}192{_}11 By faith Sarah  herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age,  because she considered him faithful who had promised.
G-Hebrews{_}193{_}12 Therefore  from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many  as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the  seashore.
G-Hebrews{_}194{_}13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but  having seen them and greeted them from a distance, and having  acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
G-Hebrews{_}195{_}14 For  people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country  of their own.
G-Hebrews{_}196{_}15 And if they had been thinking of that country from which  they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.
G-Hebrews{_}197{_}16 But as it  is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
G-Hebrews{_}198{_}Therefore God is  not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
G-Hebrews{_}199{_}17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and  he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son, 18  of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your descendants be called."
G-Hebrews{_}200{_}19 He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead;  from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
G-Hebrews{_}201{_}20 By faith  Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
G-Hebrews{_}202{_}21 By faith Jacob,  when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped  as he leaned on the top of his staff.
G-Hebrews{_}203{_}22 By faith Joseph, when he was at  the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites, and gave  orders concerning his bones.
G-Hebrews{_}204{_}23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three  months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and  they were not afraid of the king's edict.
G-Hebrews{_}205{_}24 By faith Moses, when he was  grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 25 choosing  rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the  fleeting pleasures of sin.
G-Hebrews{_}206{_}26 He considered abuse suffered for the Christ  greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his  reward.
G-Hebrews{_}207{_}27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he  endured as seeing him who is invisible.
G-Hebrews{_}208{_}28 By faith he kept the Passover  and the sprinkling of the blood, so the destroyer of the firstborn would  not touch them.
G-Hebrews{_}209{_}29 By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on  dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
G-Hebrews{_}210{_}30  By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for  seven days.
G-Hebrews{_}211{_}31 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who  were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies.
G-Hebrews{_}212{_}32 And what more shall I say?
G-Hebrews{_}213{_}For time will fail me if I tell of  Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,  33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of justice,  received promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34 quenched the power of  fire, escaped the edge of the sword, whose weakness was turned to  strength, who became mighty in war, and put foreign armies to flight.
G-Hebrews{_}214{_}35  Women received back their dead, raised to life again.
G-Hebrews{_}215{_}Others were  tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better  resurrection.
G-Hebrews{_}216{_}36 And others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes,  also chains and imprisonment.
G-Hebrews{_}217{_}37 They were stoned, they were sawn in  two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep  and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated  38 of whom the world was not  worthy  wandering in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in  the ground.
G-Hebrews{_}218{_}39 And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not  receive what was promised, 40 because God had provided something  better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
G-Hebrews{_}219{_}12 	1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of  witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily  entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before  us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who  for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the  shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
G-Hebrews{_}220{_}3 Consider  him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you  may not grow weary and lose heart.
G-Hebrews{_}221{_}4 In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the  point of shedding your blood.
G-Hebrews{_}222{_}5 And have you forgotten the exhortation  which addresses you as sons?
G-Hebrews{_}223{_}  	"My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,  		nor lose courage when you are rebuked by him.
G-Hebrews{_}224{_}6	For those whom the Lord loves he disciplines,  		and he scourges every son whom he receives."
G-Hebrews{_}225{_}7 It is for discipline that you endure.
G-Hebrews{_}226{_}God is treating you as sons; for what  son is there whom his father does not discipline?
G-Hebrews{_}227{_}8 If you are left without  discipline, in which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate  children and not sons.
G-Hebrews{_}228{_}9 Besides this, we have had fathers of our flesh to  discipline us and we respected them.
G-Hebrews{_}229{_}Shall we not much more be subject  to the Father of spirits and live?
G-Hebrews{_}230{_}10 For they disciplined us for a short  time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we  may share his holiness.
G-Hebrews{_}231{_}11 For the moment all discipline seems painful  rather than pleasant; but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness  to those who have been trained by it.
G-Hebrews{_}232{_}12 Therefore lift your feeble hands and strengthen your weak  knees, 13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may  not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
G-Hebrews{_}233{_}14 Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without  which no one will see the Lord.
G-Hebrews{_}234{_}15 See to it that no one comes short of  the grace of God; that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble,  and by it many become defiled; 16 that no one be immoral or godless like  Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.
G-Hebrews{_}235{_}17 For you know that  afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he  found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.
G-Hebrews{_}236{_}18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and  to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind, 19 and the  blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice whose words made the hearers  beg that no further word be spoken to them.
G-Hebrews{_}237{_}20 For they could not endure  the order that was given, "If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be  stoned."
G-Hebrews{_}238{_}21 The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling  with fear."
G-Hebrews{_}239{_}22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the  living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the joyful  assembly 23 and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and  to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,  24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled  blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel.
G-Hebrews{_}240{_}25 See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
G-Hebrews{_}241{_}For if  they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth,  how much less shall we escape, if we turn away from him who warns us  from heaven?
G-Hebrews{_}242{_}26 Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has  promised, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also  heaven."
G-Hebrews{_}243{_}27 This phrase, "Yet once more," indicates the removing of  those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that what  cannot be shaken may remain.
G-Hebrews{_}244{_}28 Therefore, since we are receiving a  kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and offer to God  acceptable worship with reverence and awe, 29 for our God is a  consuming fire.
G-Hebrews{_}245{_}13 	1 Let brotherly love continue.
G-Hebrews{_}246{_}2 Do not forget to show  hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained  angels without knowing it.
G-Hebrews{_}247{_}3 Remember the prisoners, as though in prison  with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves are also in  the body.
G-Hebrews{_}248{_}4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage  bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous.
G-Hebrews{_}249{_}5 Keep  your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have,  for God has said, "I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."
G-Hebrews{_}250{_}6 So we  say with confidence,  	"The Lord is my helper;  		I will not be afraid.
G-Hebrews{_}251{_}What can man do to me?"
G-Hebrews{_}252{_}7 Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of  God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith.
G-Hebrews{_}253{_}8 Jesus  Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
G-Hebrews{_}254{_}9 Do not be carried  away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be  strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so  occupied were not benefited.
G-Hebrews{_}255{_}10 We have an altar from which those who  serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
G-Hebrews{_}256{_}11 For the bodies of those  animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as  an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.
G-Hebrews{_}257{_}12 And so Jesus also  suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people through his own  blood.
G-Hebrews{_}258{_}13 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace  he bore.
G-Hebrews{_}259{_}14 For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking  for the city which is to come.
G-Hebrews{_}260{_}15 Through him then let us continually  offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that  acknowledge his name.
G-Hebrews{_}261{_}16 Do not forget to do good and to share with  others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
G-Hebrews{_}262{_}17 Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping  watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account.
G-Hebrews{_}263{_}Let them do  this with joy, and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.
G-Hebrews{_}264{_}18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience,  desiring to live honorably in all things.
G-Hebrews{_}265{_}19 I urge you all the more to do  this so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
G-Hebrews{_}266{_}20 Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead  our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the  eternal covenant, 21 equip you with every good thing to do his will,  working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to  whom be glory for ever and ever.
G-Hebrews{_}267{_}Amen.
G-Hebrews{_}268{_}22 I urge you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation, for I  have written to you briefly.
G-Hebrews{_}269{_}23 You should know that our brother Timothy  has been released, with whom I will see you if he comes soon.
G-Hebrews{_}270{_}24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints.
G-Hebrews{_}271{_}Those who come  from Italy send you greetings.
G-Hebrews{_}272{_}25 Grace be with you all.
