G-John{_}1{_}The Gospel  According to John  1 	1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.
G-John{_}2{_}2 He was with God in the beginning.
G-John{_}3{_}3 All things  were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was  made.
G-John{_}4{_}4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
G-John{_}5{_}5 The light  shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
G-John{_}6{_}6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
G-John{_}7{_}7 He  came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe  through him.
G-John{_}8{_}8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light.
G-John{_}9{_}9 The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
G-John{_}10{_}10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the  world did not know him.
G-John{_}11{_}11 He came to his own, and his own did not  receive him.
G-John{_}12{_}12 But to all who received him, to those who believed in his  name, he gave the right to become children of God13 who were born,  not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of  God.
G-John{_}13{_}14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have  seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of  grace and truth.
G-John{_}14{_}15 John bore witness of him and cried out, saying, "This  was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, for he  was before me.'"
G-John{_}15{_}16 And from his fullness have we all received, grace  upon grace.
G-John{_}16{_}17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth  came through Jesus Christ.
G-John{_}17{_}18 No one has ever seen God; God the only  Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.
G-John{_}18{_}19 Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests  and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
G-John{_}19{_}20 He confessed,  he did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
G-John{_}20{_}21 And they asked  him, "What then?
G-John{_}21{_}Are you Elijah?"
G-John{_}22{_}He said, "I am not."
G-John{_}23{_}"Are you the  prophet?"
G-John{_}24{_}And he answered, "No."
G-John{_}25{_}22 Then they said to him, "Who are  you?
G-John{_}26{_}Give us an answer for those who sent us.
G-John{_}27{_}What do you say about  yourself?"
G-John{_}28{_}23 He said,  	"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,  	'Make straight the way of the Lord,'  as the prophet Isaiah said."
G-John{_}29{_}24 Now they had been sent from the  Pharisees.
G-John{_}30{_}25 They asked him, "Then why do you baptize, if you are not  the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"
G-John{_}31{_}26 John answered them, "I  baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not  know.
G-John{_}32{_}27 It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not  worthy to untie."
G-John{_}33{_}28 This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where  John was baptizing.
G-John{_}34{_}29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said,  "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
G-John{_}35{_}30 This  is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he  was before me.'
G-John{_}36{_}31 I myself did not know him; but for this I came  baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel."
G-John{_}37{_}32 And John  bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it  remained on him.
G-John{_}38{_}33 I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize  with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and  remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
G-John{_}39{_}34 And I have seen  and testified that this is the Son of God."
G-John{_}40{_}35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his  disciples.
G-John{_}41{_}36 And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the  Lamb of God!"
G-John{_}42{_}37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they  followed Jesus.
G-John{_}43{_}38 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to  them, "What do you seek?"
G-John{_}44{_}They said to him, "Rabbi" (which means  Teacher), "where are you staying?"
G-John{_}45{_}39 He said to them, "Come and see."
G-John{_}46{_}They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that  day, for it was about the tenth hour.
G-John{_}47{_}40 One of the two who heard John  speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
G-John{_}48{_}41 He first  found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the  Messiah" (which means the Christ).
G-John{_}49{_}42 He brought him to Jesus.
G-John{_}50{_}Jesus  looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John.
G-John{_}51{_}You shall be called  Cephas" (which means Peter).
G-John{_}52{_}43 The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee.
G-John{_}53{_}And he found  Philip and said to him, "Follow me."
G-John{_}54{_}44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida,  the city of Andrew and Peter.
G-John{_}55{_}45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him,  "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets,  wrote  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
G-John{_}56{_}46 And Nathanael said to  him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"
G-John{_}57{_}Philip said to him,  "Come and see."
G-John{_}58{_}47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said of  him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
G-John{_}59{_}48 Nathanael  said to him, "How do you know me?"
G-John{_}60{_}Jesus answered him, "Before Philip  called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
G-John{_}61{_}49 Nathanael  answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God!
G-John{_}62{_}You are the King of  Israel!"
G-John{_}63{_}50 Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, I saw you under  the fig tree, do you believe?
G-John{_}64{_}You shall see greater things than these."
G-John{_}65{_}51  And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven open,  and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
G-John{_}66{_}2 	1 On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and  the mother of Jesus was there.
G-John{_}67{_}2 And Jesus and his disciples had also  been invited to the wedding.
G-John{_}68{_}3 When the wine was gone, the mother of  Jesus said to him, "They have no wine."
G-John{_}69{_}4 Jesus said to her, "Woman,  what have you to do with me?
G-John{_}70{_}My hour has not yet come."
G-John{_}71{_}5 His mother  said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
G-John{_}72{_}6 Now six stone jars  were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews,  each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
G-John{_}73{_}7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars  with water."
G-John{_}74{_}And they filled them up to the brim.
G-John{_}75{_}8 He said to them, "Now  draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast."
G-John{_}76{_}So they took it.
G-John{_}77{_}9  When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and  did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn  the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.
G-John{_}78{_}10 And he  said to him, "Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests  have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine  until now."
G-John{_}79{_}11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee,  and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
G-John{_}80{_}12 After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and  his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.
G-John{_}81{_}13 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem.
G-John{_}82{_}14 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and  sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business.
G-John{_}83{_}15 And he  made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of  the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and  overturned their tables.
G-John{_}84{_}16 And he said to those who sold doves, "Take  these things away!
G-John{_}85{_}You shall not make my Father's house a house of  merchandise!"
G-John{_}86{_}17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for  your house will consume me."
G-John{_}87{_}18 Then the Jews said to him, "What sign  do you show to us, since you do this?"
G-John{_}88{_}19 Jesus answered them, "Destroy  this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
G-John{_}89{_}20 The Jews then said, "It  has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in  three days?"
G-John{_}90{_}21 But he was speaking of the temple of his body.
G-John{_}91{_}22 When  therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he  had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus  had spoken.
G-John{_}92{_}23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many  believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did.
G-John{_}93{_}24 But Jesus  did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, 25 and he had no  need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.
G-John{_}94{_}3 	1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a  ruler of the Jews.
G-John{_}95{_}2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him,  "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can  do these signs that you do unless God is with him."
G-John{_}96{_}3 Jesus answered  him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see  the kingdom of God."
G-John{_}97{_}4 Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born  when he is old?
G-John{_}98{_}Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and  be born?"
G-John{_}99{_}5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born  of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
G-John{_}100{_}6 That which  is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
G-John{_}101{_}7  Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
G-John{_}102{_}8 The wind  blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell  where it comes from or where it goes.
G-John{_}103{_}So it is with everyone who is born  of the Spirit."
G-John{_}104{_}9 Nicodemus said to him, "How can this be?"
G-John{_}105{_}10 Jesus  answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not  understand these things?
G-John{_}106{_}11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what  we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do not receive our  testimony.
G-John{_}107{_}12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe,  how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
G-John{_}108{_}13 No one has  ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven  the Son of Man.
G-John{_}109{_}14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of  Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
G-John{_}110{_}16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever  believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
G-John{_}111{_}17 For God did  not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world  through him might be saved.
G-John{_}112{_}18 He who believes in him is not  condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because  he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.
G-John{_}113{_}19 And this is the  judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness  rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
G-John{_}114{_}20 For every one who  does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds  should be exposed.
G-John{_}115{_}21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that  it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God."
G-John{_}116{_}22 After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea,  and there he remained with them and baptized.
G-John{_}117{_}23 Now John also was  baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and  people came and were baptized.
G-John{_}118{_}24 For John had not yet been put in  prison.
G-John{_}119{_}25 Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a  Jew over purifying.
G-John{_}120{_}26 And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, he  who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified behold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him."
G-John{_}121{_}27 John answered, "A  man can receive only what is given to him from heaven.
G-John{_}122{_}28 You  yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but I have  been sent before him.
G-John{_}123{_}29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the  friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly  because of the bridegroom's voice.
G-John{_}124{_}Therefore this joy of mine is now full.
G-John{_}125{_}30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
G-John{_}126{_}31 "He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the  earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks.
G-John{_}127{_}He who comes from  heaven is above all.
G-John{_}128{_}32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet no  one receives his testimony.
G-John{_}129{_}33 He who has received his testimony has  certified that God is true.
G-John{_}130{_}34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words  of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
G-John{_}131{_}35 The Father loves the  Son, and has given all things into his hand.
G-John{_}132{_}36 He who believes in the  Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but  the wrath of God remains on him."
G-John{_}133{_}4 	1 Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that  Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although  Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), 3 he left Judea and  departed again to Galilee.
G-John{_}134{_}4 Now he had to go through Samaria.
G-John{_}135{_}5 So he  came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground  that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
G-John{_}136{_}6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus,  wearied as he was from his journey, sat down by the well.
G-John{_}137{_}It was about the  sixth hour.
G-John{_}138{_}7 There came a woman of Samaria to draw water.
G-John{_}139{_}Jesus said to  her, "Give me a drink."
G-John{_}140{_}8 For his disciples had gone away into the city to  buy food.
G-John{_}141{_}9 Then the woman of Samaria said to him, "How is it that you,  being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"
G-John{_}142{_}For Jews have no  dealings with Samaritans.
G-John{_}143{_}10 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of  God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would  have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
G-John{_}144{_}11 The  woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is  deep.
G-John{_}145{_}Where do you get that living water?
G-John{_}146{_}12 Are you greater than our  father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as  his sons and his cattle?"
G-John{_}147{_}13 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of  this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall  give him will never thirst.
G-John{_}148{_}The water that I shall give him will become in  him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
G-John{_}149{_}15 The woman said to  him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to  draw."
G-John{_}150{_}16 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
G-John{_}151{_}17  The woman answered, "I have no husband."
G-John{_}152{_}Jesus said to her, "You are  right in saying, 'I have no husband'; 18 for you have had five husbands,  and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said  truly."
G-John{_}153{_}19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
G-John{_}154{_}20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in  Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
G-John{_}155{_}21 Jesus said to her,  "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain  nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
G-John{_}156{_}22 You worship what you  do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
G-John{_}157{_}23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will  worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to  worship him.
G-John{_}158{_}24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship  in spirit and truth."
G-John{_}159{_}25 The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is  coming" (who is called Christ).
G-John{_}160{_}"When he comes, he will tell us all  things."
G-John{_}161{_}26 Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."
G-John{_}162{_}27 Just then his disciples came.
G-John{_}163{_}And they marveled that he was  talking with a woman, but no one said, "What do you wish?"
G-John{_}164{_}or, "Why  are you talking with her?"
G-John{_}165{_}28 Then the woman left her water jar, and went  away into the city, and said to the people, 29 "Come, see a man who told  me all that I ever did.
G-John{_}166{_}Could this be the Christ?"
G-John{_}167{_}30 They went out of the  city and came to him.
G-John{_}168{_}31 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
G-John{_}169{_}32  But he said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."
G-John{_}170{_}33  So the disciples said to one another, "Has any one brought him food?"
G-John{_}171{_}34  Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to  finish his work.
G-John{_}172{_}35 Do you not say, 'There are yet four months and then  comes the harvest'?
G-John{_}173{_}Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the  fields!
G-John{_}174{_}They are already white for harvest.
G-John{_}175{_}36 And he who reaps receives  wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may  rejoice together.
G-John{_}176{_}37 For here the saying is true, 'One sows and another  reaps.'
G-John{_}177{_}38 I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others  have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
G-John{_}178{_}39 Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him  because of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."
G-John{_}179{_}40 So  when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and  he stayed there two days.
G-John{_}180{_}41 And many more believed because of his  word.
G-John{_}181{_}42 They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of  what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this  man is indeed the Savior of the world."
G-John{_}182{_}43 After the two days he departed to Galilee.
G-John{_}183{_}44 For Jesus  himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
G-John{_}184{_}45 So  when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all  that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the  feast.
G-John{_}185{_}46 So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the  water wine.
G-John{_}186{_}And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.
G-John{_}187{_}47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to  him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the  point of death.
G-John{_}188{_}48 Jesus said to him, "Unless you people see signs and  wonders, you will never believe."
G-John{_}189{_}49 The official said to him, "Sir, come  down before my child dies."
G-John{_}190{_}50 Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will  live."
G-John{_}191{_}The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his  way.
G-John{_}192{_}51 As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his  son was living.
G-John{_}193{_}52 So he inquired of them the hour when his son got  better, and they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left  him."
G-John{_}194{_}53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus  had said to him, "Your son will live."
G-John{_}195{_}And he himself believed, and all his  household.
G-John{_}196{_}54 This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had  come from Judea to Galilee.
G-John{_}197{_}5 	1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem.
G-John{_}198{_}2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which  is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.
G-John{_}199{_}3 In these lay a  multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed.
G-John{_}200{_}5 One man who was  there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
G-John{_}201{_}6 When Jesus saw him  lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time, he  said to him, "Do you want to be made well?"
G-John{_}202{_}7 The sick man answered  him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred  up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
G-John{_}203{_}8 Jesus said to  him, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk."
G-John{_}204{_}9 And at once the man was  healed, and he took up his bed and walked.
G-John{_}205{_}Now that day was the Sabbath.
G-John{_}206{_}10 So the Jews said to the man  who was cured, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your  bed."
G-John{_}207{_}11 But he answered them, "The man who made me well said to me,  'Take up your bed, and walk.'"
G-John{_}208{_}12 They asked him, "Who is the man who  said to you, 'Take up your bed, and walk'?"
G-John{_}209{_}13 Now the man who had  been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there  was a crowd in that place.
G-John{_}210{_}14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple,  and said to him, "See, you are well.
G-John{_}211{_}Sin no more, so that nothing worse  may happen to you."
G-John{_}212{_}15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was  Jesus who had made him well.
G-John{_}213{_}16 For this reason the Jews persecuted  Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
G-John{_}214{_}17 But Jesus  answered them, "My Father is working still, and I am working."
G-John{_}215{_}18  Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only  broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself  equal with God.
G-John{_}216{_}19 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do  nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever  he does, the Son also does.
G-John{_}217{_}20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows  him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works  than these, that you may marvel.
G-John{_}218{_}21 For as the Father raises the dead and  gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will.
G-John{_}219{_}22 For the  Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, 23 that all  may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.
G-John{_}220{_}He who does not honor  the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
G-John{_}221{_}24 Truly, truly, I say to  you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal  life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
G-John{_}222{_}25 Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the  dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.
G-John{_}223{_}26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to  have life in himself, 27 and has given him authority to execute judgment,  because he is the Son of Man.
G-John{_}224{_}28 Do not marvel at this; for the hour is  coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice 29 and come  forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those  who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
G-John{_}225{_}30 "I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my  judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who  sent me.
G-John{_}226{_}31 "If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true.
G-John{_}227{_}32  There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony  which he bears of me is true.
G-John{_}228{_}33 You have sent to John, and he has borne  witness to the truth.
G-John{_}229{_}34 Not that the testimony which I receive is from  man; but I say this that you may be saved.
G-John{_}230{_}35 He was a burning and  shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.
G-John{_}231{_}36  But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works  which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am  doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
G-John{_}232{_}37 And the Father  who sent me has himself testified of me.
G-John{_}233{_}You have never heard his voice,  nor seen his form.
G-John{_}234{_}38 And you do not have his word abiding in you, for  you do not believe him whom he has sent.
G-John{_}235{_}39 You search the Scriptures,  because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they  that testify of me.
G-John{_}236{_}40 Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.
G-John{_}237{_}41 "I do not receive glory from men.
G-John{_}238{_}42 But I know you, that you  do not have the love of God in you.
G-John{_}239{_}43 I have come in my Father's name,  and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you  will receive.
G-John{_}240{_}44 How can you believe, who receive glory from one another,  and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?
G-John{_}241{_}45 Do not think  that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on  whom you set your hope.
G-John{_}242{_}46 If you believed Moses, you would believe  me, for he wrote about me.
G-John{_}243{_}47 But if you do not believe his writings, how  will you believe my words?"
G-John{_}244{_}6 	1 After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee,  which is the Sea of Tiberias.
G-John{_}245{_}2 And a great multitude followed him,  because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were  diseased.
G-John{_}246{_}3 Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his  disciples.
G-John{_}247{_}4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
G-John{_}248{_}5 Then  Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward him,  he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?"
G-John{_}249{_}6 But this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
G-John{_}250{_}7  Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread  for each one of them to have a little."
G-John{_}251{_}8 One of his disciples, Andrew,  Simon Peter's brother, said to him, 9 "There is a lad here who has five  barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?"
G-John{_}252{_}10  Jesus said, "Make the people sit down."
G-John{_}253{_}Now there was much grass in the  place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
G-John{_}254{_}11 Jesus then  took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to  those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.
G-John{_}255{_}12 And  when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the  fragments left over, that nothing may be lost."
G-John{_}256{_}13 So they gathered them  up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves,  left over by those who had eaten.
G-John{_}257{_}14 When the people saw the sign that  Jesus did, they said, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the  world."
G-John{_}258{_}15 Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by  force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
G-John{_}259{_}16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 17  got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum.
G-John{_}260{_}It was now dark,  and Jesus had not yet come to them.
G-John{_}261{_}18 The sea rose because a strong  wind was blowing.
G-John{_}262{_}19 So when they had rowed about three or four miles,  they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they  were afraid.
G-John{_}263{_}20 But he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."
G-John{_}264{_}21 Then  they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at  the land where they were going.
G-John{_}265{_}22 On the next day the people who remained on the other side of  the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had  not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone  away alone.
G-John{_}266{_}23 However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where  they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
G-John{_}267{_}24 So when the people  saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats  and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
G-John{_}268{_}25 When they found him on the  other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
G-John{_}269{_}26 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not  because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.
G-John{_}270{_}27  Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures  to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God  the Father set his seal."
G-John{_}271{_}28 Then they said to him, "What must we do, to  be doing the works of God?"
G-John{_}272{_}29 Jesus answered them, "This is the work  of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
G-John{_}273{_}30 So they said to  him, "What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe  you?
G-John{_}274{_}What work will you do?
G-John{_}275{_}31 Our fathers ate the manna in the desert;  as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
G-John{_}276{_}32 Jesus then  said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you  the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from  heaven.
G-John{_}277{_}33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and  gives life to the world."
G-John{_}278{_}34 Then they said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always."
G-John{_}279{_}35  And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.
G-John{_}280{_}He who comes to me shall  never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.
G-John{_}281{_}36 But I said  to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.
G-John{_}282{_}37 All that the  Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by  no means cast out.
G-John{_}283{_}38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my  own will, but the will of him who sent me.
G-John{_}284{_}39 And this is the will of him  who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but  raise it up at the last day.
G-John{_}285{_}40 For this is the will of my Father, that every  one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I  will raise him up at the last day."
G-John{_}286{_}41 The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said,  "I am the bread which came down from heaven."
G-John{_}287{_}42 They said, "Is not this  Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
G-John{_}288{_}How does he  now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"
G-John{_}289{_}43 Jesus answered them, "Do  not murmur among yourselves.
G-John{_}290{_}44 No one can come to me unless the  Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
G-John{_}291{_}45  It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.'
G-John{_}292{_}Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.
G-John{_}293{_}46 Not  that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has  seen the Father.
G-John{_}294{_}47 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has  everlasting life.
G-John{_}295{_}48 I am the bread of life.
G-John{_}296{_}49 Your fathers ate the manna in  the wilderness, and they died.
G-John{_}297{_}50 This is the bread which comes down  from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.
G-John{_}298{_}51 I am the living bread  which came down from heaven.
G-John{_}299{_}If anyone eats of this bread, he will live  for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my  flesh."
G-John{_}300{_}52 Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying,  "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
G-John{_}301{_}53 So Jesus said to them,  "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and  drink his blood, you have no life in you.
G-John{_}302{_}54 Whoever eats my flesh and  drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
G-John{_}303{_}55  For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
G-John{_}304{_}56 He who  eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
G-John{_}305{_}57 As the  living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on  me will live because of me.
G-John{_}306{_}58 This is the bread which came down from  heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died.
G-John{_}307{_}He who eats this  bread will live for ever."
G-John{_}308{_}59 This he said in the synagogue as he taught in  Capernaum.
G-John{_}309{_}60 Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is a  hard saying; who can listen to it?"
G-John{_}310{_}61 When Jesus knew in himself that  his disciples complained about this, he said to them, "Does this offend  you?
G-John{_}311{_}62 What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he  was before?
G-John{_}312{_}63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.
G-John{_}313{_}The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.
G-John{_}314{_}64 But  there are some of you who do not believe."
G-John{_}315{_}For Jesus knew from the  beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.
G-John{_}316{_}65 And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me  unless it has been granted to him by the Father."
G-John{_}317{_}66 From this time many  of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him.
G-John{_}318{_}67 Then Jesus  said to the twelve, "Do you also want to go away?"
G-John{_}319{_}68 Simon Peter  answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
G-John{_}320{_}You have the words of  eternal life.
G-John{_}321{_}69 And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the  Holy One of God."
G-John{_}322{_}70 Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the  twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
G-John{_}323{_}71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son  of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve.
G-John{_}324{_}7 	1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about  in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
G-John{_}325{_}2 Now the Jews' feast of  Tabernacles was at hand.
G-John{_}326{_}3 So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and  go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.
G-John{_}327{_}4 For no  one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.
G-John{_}328{_}If you do these  things, show yourself to the world."
G-John{_}329{_}5 For even his brothers did not  believe in him.
G-John{_}330{_}6 Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your  time is always ready.
G-John{_}331{_}7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me  because I testify of it that its works are evil.
G-John{_}332{_}8 You go up to the feast.
G-John{_}333{_}I am  not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come."
G-John{_}334{_}9  Having said this, he remained in Galilee.
G-John{_}335{_}10 But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also  went up, not publicly, but in secret.
G-John{_}336{_}11 The Jews were looking for him at  the feast, and saying, "Where is he?"
G-John{_}337{_}12 And there was much complaining  among the people about him.
G-John{_}338{_}Some said, "He is a good man"; others said,  "No, on the contrary, he deceives the people."
G-John{_}339{_}13 However, no one spoke  openly of him for fear of the Jews.
G-John{_}340{_}14 Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the  temple and taught.
G-John{_}341{_}15 And the Jews marveled, saying, "How did this man  get such learning, having never studied?"
G-John{_}342{_}16 Jesus answered them, "My  teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
G-John{_}343{_}17 If anyone is willing to do  his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I  speak on my own authority.
G-John{_}344{_}18 He who speaks from himself seeks his  own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true,  and in him there is no falsehood.
G-John{_}345{_}19 Did not Moses give you the law?
G-John{_}346{_}Yet  none of you keeps the law.
G-John{_}347{_}Why do you seek to kill me?"
G-John{_}348{_}20 The people  answered, "You have a demon.
G-John{_}349{_}Who is seeking to kill you?"
G-John{_}350{_}21 Jesus  answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel.
G-John{_}351{_}22 Moses therefore  gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers),  and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
G-John{_}352{_}23 If on the Sabbath a man  receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are  you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body  well?
G-John{_}353{_}24 Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."
G-John{_}354{_}25 Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this the  man whom they seek to kill?
G-John{_}355{_}26 Here he is, speaking publicly, and they  say nothing to him!
G-John{_}356{_}Can it be that the authorities really know that he is  the Christ?
G-John{_}357{_}27 But we know where this man is from; when the Christ  comes, no one will know where he is from."
G-John{_}358{_}28 Then Jesus cried out, as  he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I am from;  and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you  do not know.
G-John{_}359{_}29 But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me."
G-John{_}360{_}30  Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his  hour had not yet come.
G-John{_}361{_}31 And many of the people believed in him, and  they said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man  has done?"
G-John{_}362{_}32 The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about  him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.
G-John{_}363{_}33  Then Jesus said to them, "I shall be with you a little while longer, and  then I go to him who sent me.
G-John{_}364{_}34 You will seek me, and you will not find  me; where I am you cannot come."
G-John{_}365{_}35 The Jews said to one another,  "Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him?
G-John{_}366{_}Does he  intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
G-John{_}367{_}36  What does he mean when he said, 'You will seek me and you will not  find me,' and, 'Where I am you cannot come'?"
G-John{_}368{_}37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and  cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.
G-John{_}369{_}38 He who  believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers  of living water."
G-John{_}370{_}39 Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who  believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given,  because Jesus was not yet glorified.
G-John{_}371{_}40 When they heard these words, some of the people said,  "Surely this is the prophet."
G-John{_}372{_}41 Others said, "This is the Christ."
G-John{_}373{_}But  some said, "Will the Christ come from Galilee?
G-John{_}374{_}42 Has not the scripture  said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town  where David was?"
G-John{_}375{_}43 So there was a division among the people because  of him.
G-John{_}376{_}44 Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on  him.
G-John{_}377{_}45 The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees,  who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"
G-John{_}378{_}46 The officers  answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"
G-John{_}379{_}47 The Pharisees answered  them, "Are you deceived, you also?
G-John{_}380{_}48 Have any of the rulers or of the  Pharisees believed in him?
G-John{_}381{_}49 But this crowd that does not know the law  is accursed."
G-John{_}382{_}50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was  one of them, said to them, 51 "Does our law judge a man without first  giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?"
G-John{_}383{_}52 They replied,  "Are you from Galilee, too?
G-John{_}384{_}Search and look, and you will find that no  prophet is to rise out of Galilee."
G-John{_}385{_}8 	53 Then each went to his own house.
G-John{_}386{_}1 But Jesus went to the  Mount of Olives.
G-John{_}387{_}2 Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all  the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
G-John{_}388{_}3 Then the  scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery.
G-John{_}389{_}And  when they had set her in the midst, 4 they said to him, "Teacher, this  woman was caught in the act of adultery.
G-John{_}390{_}5 Now in the law Moses  commanded us to stone such.
G-John{_}391{_}What do you say?"
G-John{_}392{_}6 They said this to test  him, that they might have something of which to accuse him.
G-John{_}393{_}But Jesus  bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
G-John{_}394{_}7 And when they  continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is  without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her."
G-John{_}395{_}8 And again  he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
G-John{_}396{_}9 Then those who heard it  went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and  Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him.
G-John{_}397{_}10 Jesus  straightened up and said to her, "Woman, where are they?
G-John{_}398{_}Has no one  condemned you?"
G-John{_}399{_}11 She said, "No one, Lord."
G-John{_}400{_}And Jesus said, "Neither  do I condemn you; go, and sin no more."
G-John{_}401{_}12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the  world.
G-John{_}402{_}He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the  light of life."
G-John{_}403{_}13 The Pharisees then said to him, "You are bearing witness  of yourself; your testimony is not true."
G-John{_}404{_}14 Jesus answered, "Even if I  bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came  from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and  where I am going.
G-John{_}405{_}15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
G-John{_}406{_}16  And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am  with the Father who sent me.
G-John{_}407{_}17 In your own law it is written that the  testimony of two men is true.
G-John{_}408{_}18 I am One who bears witness of myself,  and the Father who sent me bears witness of me."
G-John{_}409{_}19 Then they said to  him, "Where is your Father?"
G-John{_}410{_}Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor  my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also."
G-John{_}411{_}20 These  words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one  arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
G-John{_}412{_}21 Then Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you  will seek me, and will die in your sin.
G-John{_}413{_}Where I go you cannot come."
G-John{_}414{_}22  Then the Jews said, "Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I go you  cannot come'?"
G-John{_}415{_}23 He said to them, "You are from below; I am from  above.
G-John{_}416{_}You are of this world; I am not of this world.
G-John{_}417{_}24 Therefore I told to  you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he,  you will die in your sins."
G-John{_}418{_}25 They said to him, "Who are you?"
G-John{_}419{_}Jesus  said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
G-John{_}420{_}26  I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is  true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him."
G-John{_}421{_}27 They did  not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.
G-John{_}422{_}28 So Jesus said,  "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am  he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the  Father taught me.
G-John{_}423{_}29 And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me  alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him."
G-John{_}424{_}30 As he spoke these  words, many believed in him.
G-John{_}425{_}31 Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you  continue in my word, you are truly my disciples.
G-John{_}426{_}32 And you will know  the truth, and the truth will make you free."
G-John{_}427{_}33 They answered him, "We  are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone.
G-John{_}428{_}How can you say, 'You will be made free'?"
G-John{_}429{_}34 Jesus answered them,  "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
G-John{_}430{_}35  And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues  forever.
G-John{_}431{_}36 So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
G-John{_}432{_}37 I  know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me,  because my word has no place in you.
G-John{_}433{_}38 I speak of what I have seen with  my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father."
G-John{_}434{_}39 They answered him, "Abraham is our father."
G-John{_}435{_}Jesus said to  them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham  did, 40 but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth  which I heard from God.
G-John{_}436{_}This is not what Abraham did.
G-John{_}437{_}41 You do the  deeds of your father."
G-John{_}438{_}They said to him, "We were not born of  fornication; we have one Father  God."
G-John{_}439{_}42 Jesus said to them, "If God  were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth  from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me.
G-John{_}440{_}43 Why do  you not understand what I say?
G-John{_}441{_}It is because you are not able to hear my  word.
G-John{_}442{_}44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your  father's desires.
G-John{_}443{_}He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand  in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
G-John{_}444{_}When he lies, he speaks  according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
G-John{_}445{_}45 But  because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.
G-John{_}446{_}46 Which of you convicts  me of sin?
G-John{_}447{_}If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
G-John{_}448{_}47 He who is of  God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you  are not of God."
G-John{_}449{_}48 The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you  are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
G-John{_}450{_}49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a  demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
G-John{_}451{_}50 Yet I do not seek  my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.
G-John{_}452{_}51  Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see  death."
G-John{_}453{_}52 The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon!
G-John{_}454{_}Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, 'If anyone keeps my  word, he will never taste death.'
G-John{_}455{_}53 Are you greater than our father  Abraham?
G-John{_}456{_}He died, and so did the prophets.
G-John{_}457{_}Who do you claim to be?"
G-John{_}458{_}54  Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
G-John{_}459{_}It is my Father  who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.
G-John{_}460{_}55 But you have  not known him; I know him.
G-John{_}461{_}If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar  like you; but I do know him and keep his word.
G-John{_}462{_}56 Your father Abraham  rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad."
G-John{_}463{_}57 The Jews then said to  him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"
G-John{_}464{_}58  Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."
G-John{_}465{_}59 So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and  went out of the temple.
G-John{_}466{_}9 	1 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
G-John{_}467{_}2 And his  disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he  was born blind?"
G-John{_}468{_}3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man sinned nor his  parents sinned.
G-John{_}469{_}But that the works of God might be revealed in him, 4 we  must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day.
G-John{_}470{_}Night is  coming, when no one can work.
G-John{_}471{_}5 As long as I am in the world, I am the  light of the world."
G-John{_}472{_}6 As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay  of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay.
G-John{_}473{_}7 And he said to  him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means, Sent).
G-John{_}474{_}So he went  and washed, and came back seeing.
G-John{_}475{_}8 The neighbors and those who had  seen him before as a beggar, said, "Is not this the man who used to sit and  beg?"
G-John{_}476{_}9 Some said, "It is he."
G-John{_}477{_}Others said, "No, but he is like him."
G-John{_}478{_}He  said, "I am the man.
G-John{_}479{_}"10 They said to him, "Then how were your eyes  opened?"
G-John{_}480{_}11 He answered and said, "A man called Jesus made clay and  anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' So  I went and washed, and I received sight."
G-John{_}481{_}12 They said to him, "Where is  he?"
G-John{_}482{_}He said, "I do not know."
G-John{_}483{_}13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been  blind.
G-John{_}484{_}14 Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened  his eyes.
G-John{_}485{_}15 Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received  his sight.
G-John{_}486{_}He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I  see."
G-John{_}487{_}16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he  does not keep the Sabbath."
G-John{_}488{_}But others said, "How can a man who is a  sinner do such signs?"
G-John{_}489{_}And there was a division among them.
G-John{_}490{_}17 So they  again said to the blind man, "What do you say about him, since he has  opened your eyes?"
G-John{_}491{_}He said, "He is a prophet."
G-John{_}492{_}18 The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had  received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had  received his sight.
G-John{_}493{_}19 And they asked them, "Is this your son, who you  say was born blind?
G-John{_}494{_}How then does he now see?"
G-John{_}495{_}20 His parents  answered, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 21  but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his  eyes.
G-John{_}496{_}Ask him.
G-John{_}497{_}He is of age; he will speak for himself."
G-John{_}498{_}22 His parents  said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already  that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the  synagogue.
G-John{_}499{_}23 Therefore his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
G-John{_}500{_}24 So for the second time they called the man who had been  blind, and said to him, "Give God the glory; we know that this man is a  sinner."
G-John{_}501{_}25 He answered, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know.
G-John{_}502{_}One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see."
G-John{_}503{_}26 Then they said  to him, "What did he do to you?
G-John{_}504{_}How did he open your eyes?"
G-John{_}505{_}27 He  answered them, "I have told you already and you did not listen.
G-John{_}506{_}Why do  you want to hear it again?
G-John{_}507{_}Do you want to become his disciples, too?"
G-John{_}508{_}28  Then they reviled him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are  disciples of Moses.
G-John{_}509{_}29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this  fellow, we do not know where he comes from."
G-John{_}510{_}30 The man answered,  "Why, this is a marvel!
G-John{_}511{_}You do not know where he comes from, and yet  he opened my eyes.
G-John{_}512{_}31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but  if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.
G-John{_}513{_}32  Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the  eyes of a man born blind.
G-John{_}514{_}33 If this man were not from God, he could do  nothing."
G-John{_}515{_}34 They answered him, "You were born in utter sin, and are you  teaching us?"
G-John{_}516{_}And they cast him out.
G-John{_}517{_}35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found  him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
G-John{_}518{_}36 He answered,  "Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"
G-John{_}519{_}37 Jesus said to him, "You  have seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."
G-John{_}520{_}38 Then he said, "Lord,  I believe!"
G-John{_}521{_}And he worshiped him.
G-John{_}522{_}39 Jesus said, "For judgment I have  come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those  who see may become blind."
G-John{_}523{_}40 Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this,  and said to him, "Are we blind also?"
G-John{_}524{_}41 Jesus said to them, "If you were  blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin  remains.
G-John{_}525{_}10 	1 "Truly, truly, I say to you, the man who does not enter the  sheepfold by the door, but climbs in by some other way, he is a thief and  a robber.
G-John{_}526{_}2 But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
G-John{_}527{_}3  To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls  his own sheep by name and leads them out.
G-John{_}528{_}4 When he has brought out all  his own, he goes on before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know  his voice.
G-John{_}529{_}5 A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him,  for they do not know the voice of strangers."
G-John{_}530{_}6 This figure Jesus used  with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
G-John{_}531{_}7 Then Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am  the door of the sheep.
G-John{_}532{_}8 All who ever came before me are thieves and  robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
G-John{_}533{_}9 I am the door.
G-John{_}534{_}If anyone enters  by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
G-John{_}535{_}10 The  thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may  have life, and have it abundantly.
G-John{_}536{_}11 I am the good shepherd.
G-John{_}537{_}The good  shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
G-John{_}538{_}12 But he who is a hireling and  not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and  leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters  them.
G-John{_}539{_}13 He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.
G-John{_}540{_}14 I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me15  just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life  for the sheep.
G-John{_}541{_}16 And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must  bring them also, and they will heed my voice.
G-John{_}542{_}So there shall be one flock  and one shepherd.
G-John{_}543{_}17 For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay  down my life, that I may take it again.
G-John{_}544{_}18 No one takes it from me, but I  lay it down of my own accord.
G-John{_}545{_}I have power to lay it down, and I have  power to take it again.
G-John{_}546{_}This command I have received from my Father."
G-John{_}547{_}19 There was again a division among the Jews because of these  words.
G-John{_}548{_}20 Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is mad.
G-John{_}549{_}Why listen  to him?"
G-John{_}550{_}21 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one who has a  demon.
G-John{_}551{_}Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
G-John{_}552{_}22 Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem.
G-John{_}553{_}It was  winter, 23 and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch.
G-John{_}554{_}24  So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, "How long will you  keep us in suspense?
G-John{_}555{_}If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
G-John{_}556{_}25 Jesus  answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe.
G-John{_}557{_}The works that I do in  my Father's name, they bear witness of me; 26 but you do not believe,  because you are not of my sheep.
G-John{_}558{_}27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know  them, and they follow me.
G-John{_}559{_}28 I give them eternal life, and they shall never  perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
G-John{_}560{_}29 My Father, who has  given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out  of my Father's hand.
G-John{_}561{_}30 I and the Father are one."
G-John{_}562{_}31 The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
G-John{_}563{_}32 Jesus  answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father.
G-John{_}564{_}For  which of these do you stone me?"
G-John{_}565{_}33 The Jews answered him, "For a  good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you,  being a man, make yourself God."
G-John{_}566{_}34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not  written in your law, 'I said, you are gods'?
G-John{_}567{_}35 If he called them gods, to  whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), 36 do  you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You  are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?
G-John{_}568{_}37 If I do not do  the works of my father, do not believe me; 38 but if I do them, even  though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and  understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father."
G-John{_}569{_}39 Again  they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.
G-John{_}570{_}40 He went away again across the Jordan to the place where  John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
G-John{_}571{_}41 And many came to him  and they said, "John performed no sign, but all that John said about this  man was true."
G-John{_}572{_}42 And many believed in him there.
G-John{_}573{_}11 	1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of  Mary and her sister Martha.
G-John{_}574{_}2 It was this Mary who anointed the Lord  with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus  was sick.
G-John{_}575{_}3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, he whom you love is  sick."
G-John{_}576{_}4 When Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not unto death,  but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through  it."
G-John{_}577{_}5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
G-John{_}578{_}6 So, when he  heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he  was.
G-John{_}579{_}7 Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."
G-John{_}580{_}8 The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to  stone you, and are you going there again?"
G-John{_}581{_}9 Jesus answered, "Are there  not twelve hours in the day?
G-John{_}582{_}If anyone walks in the day, he does not  stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
G-John{_}583{_}10 But if one walks in  the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
G-John{_}584{_}11 These things  he said, and after that he said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen  asleep, but I go to wake him up."
G-John{_}585{_}12 His disciples said, "Lord, if he  sleeps, he will recover."
G-John{_}586{_}13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they  thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.
G-John{_}587{_}14 So then Jesus told them  plainly, "Lazarus is dead; 15 and for your sake I am glad that I was not  there, so that you may believe.
G-John{_}588{_}But let us go to him."
G-John{_}589{_}16 Then Thomas,  who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that  we may die with him."
G-John{_}590{_}17 So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the  tomb four days.
G-John{_}591{_}18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, 19  and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them  concerning their brother.
G-John{_}592{_}20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,  she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house.
G-John{_}593{_}21 Martha said to Jesus,  "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
G-John{_}594{_}22 But even  now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
G-John{_}595{_}23 Jesus  said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
G-John{_}596{_}24 Martha said to him, "I  know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
G-John{_}597{_}25 Jesus  said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
G-John{_}598{_}He who believes in me,  though he die, yet shall he live; 26 and whoever lives and believes in me  shall never die.
G-John{_}599{_}Do you believe this?"
G-John{_}600{_}27 She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I  believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the  world."
G-John{_}601{_}28 And when she had said this, she went her way and called  Mary her sister, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
G-John{_}602{_}29  When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.
G-John{_}603{_}30 Now Jesus had  not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had  met him.
G-John{_}604{_}31 The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting  her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her,  supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
G-John{_}605{_}32 Then Mary,  when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to  him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
G-John{_}606{_}33  When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also  weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
G-John{_}607{_}34 And he said,  "Where have you laid him?"
G-John{_}608{_}They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
G-John{_}609{_}35 Jesus wept.
G-John{_}610{_}36 Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"
G-John{_}611{_}37 But some of  them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept  this man from dying?"
G-John{_}612{_}38 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb.
G-John{_}613{_}It was a  cave, and a stone lay against it.
G-John{_}614{_}39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
G-John{_}615{_}Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by this time there  is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days."
G-John{_}616{_}40 Jesus said to her, "Did I  not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?"
G-John{_}617{_}41 So they took away the stone.
G-John{_}618{_}And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,  "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
G-John{_}619{_}42 I knew that you always  hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they  may believe that you sent me."
G-John{_}620{_}43 When he had said this, he cried with a  loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
G-John{_}621{_}44 The dead man came out, his hands  and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth.
G-John{_}622{_}Jesus said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
G-John{_}623{_}45 Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had  seen what Jesus did, believed in him.
G-John{_}624{_}46 But some of them went to the  Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
G-John{_}625{_}47 Then the chief priests  and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we to do?
G-John{_}626{_}For  this man performs many signs.
G-John{_}627{_}48 If we let him go on like this, everyone  will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our  place and our nation."
G-John{_}628{_}49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest  that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all!
G-John{_}629{_}50 You do not  understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the  people, and that the whole nation not perish."
G-John{_}630{_}51 He did not say this on  his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would  die for the nation, 52 and not for that nation only, but also that he would  gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.
G-John{_}631{_}53 So from that day on they plotted to put him to death.
G-John{_}632{_}54 Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews,  but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called  Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.
G-John{_}633{_}55 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went  from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify  themselves.
G-John{_}634{_}56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as  they stood in the temple, "What do you think?
G-John{_}635{_}That he will not come to  the feast?"
G-John{_}636{_}57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders  that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might  arrest him.
G-John{_}637{_}12 	1 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany  where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
G-John{_}638{_}2 There they  made him a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those  who sat at the table with him.
G-John{_}639{_}3 Then Mary took a pound of very costly  perfume of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with  her hair.
G-John{_}640{_}And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
G-John{_}641{_}4  But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,  5 "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to  the poor?"
G-John{_}642{_}6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he  was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put  into it.
G-John{_}643{_}7 Jesus said, "Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my  burial.
G-John{_}644{_}8 The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have  me."
G-John{_}645{_}9 Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and  they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he  had raised from the dead.
G-John{_}646{_}10 So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus  also to death, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews were going  away and believing in Jesus.
G-John{_}647{_}12 The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard  that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
G-John{_}648{_}13 They took branches of palm trees  and went out to meet him, crying,  	"Hosanna!
G-John{_}649{_}Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
G-John{_}650{_}The King of Israel!"
G-John{_}651{_}14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,  15	"Fear not, daughter of Zion;  	behold, your King is coming,  		sitting on a donkey's colt."
G-John{_}652{_}16 His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was  glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about  him and that they had done these things to him.
G-John{_}653{_}17 The crowd that had  been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him  from the dead bore witness.
G-John{_}654{_}18 For this reason the people went to meet  him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
G-John{_}655{_}19 The Pharisees then  said to one another, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing.
G-John{_}656{_}Look,  The world has gone after him!"
G-John{_}657{_}20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to  worship at the Feast.
G-John{_}658{_}21 Then they came to Philip, who was from  Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
G-John{_}659{_}22  Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
G-John{_}660{_}23 Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be  glorified.
G-John{_}661{_}24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into  the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much  fruit.
G-John{_}662{_}25 He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in  this world will keep it for eternal life.
G-John{_}663{_}26 If anyone serves me, he must  follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also.
G-John{_}664{_}If anyone serves  me, him my Father will honor.
G-John{_}665{_}27 "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
G-John{_}666{_}'Father, save  me from this hour'?
G-John{_}667{_}No, for this purpose I came to this hour.
G-John{_}668{_}28 Father,  glorify your name."
G-John{_}669{_}Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it,  and I will glorify it again."
G-John{_}670{_}29 The crowd standing by heard it and said  that it had thundered.
G-John{_}671{_}Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
G-John{_}672{_}30  Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.
G-John{_}673{_}31  Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be  cast out.
G-John{_}674{_}32 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  to myself."
G-John{_}675{_}33 He said this to show by what death he was to die.
G-John{_}676{_}34 The  crowd answered him, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ  remains forever; and how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted  up'?
G-John{_}677{_}Who is this Son of Man?"
G-John{_}678{_}35 Then Jesus said to them, "A little  while longer the light is with you.
G-John{_}679{_}Walk while you have the light, lest the  darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know  where he is going.
G-John{_}680{_}36 While you have the light, believe in the light, that  you may become sons of light."
G-John{_}681{_}When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from  them.
G-John{_}682{_}37 Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not  believe in him; 38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  which he spoke:  	"Lord, who has believed our report?
G-John{_}683{_}And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
G-John{_}684{_}39 Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:  40	"He has blinded their eyes  		and hardened their hearts,  	lest they should see with their eyes,  		and understand with their hearts and turn,  	so that I should heal them."
G-John{_}685{_}41 Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.
G-John{_}686{_}42  Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of  the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the  synagogue; 43 for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of  God.
G-John{_}687{_}44 Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me,  believes not in me but in him who sent me.
G-John{_}688{_}45 And he who sees me sees  him who sent me.
G-John{_}689{_}46 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever  believes in me should not remain in darkness.
G-John{_}690{_}47 If anyone hears my  words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to  judge the world but to save the world.
G-John{_}691{_}48 He who rejects me and does not  receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will condemn  him on the last day.
G-John{_}692{_}49 For I have not spoken on my own authority; but  the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say and what to  speak.
G-John{_}693{_}50 And I know that his command is eternal life.
G-John{_}694{_}Whatever I say,  therefore, I say just as the Father has told me."
G-John{_}695{_}13 	1 Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his  hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved his  own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
G-John{_}696{_}2 And during  supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot,  Simon's son, to betray him, 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all  things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to  God, 4 rose from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel and girded  himself.
G-John{_}697{_}5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the  disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
G-John{_}698{_}6 Then he came to Simon Peter.
G-John{_}699{_}And Peter said to him, "Lord, are you  going to wash my feet?"
G-John{_}700{_}7 Jesus answered him, "You do not realize now  what I am doing, but later you will understand."
G-John{_}701{_}8 Peter said to him, "You  shall never wash my feet."
G-John{_}702{_}Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you  have no part with me."
G-John{_}703{_}9 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet  only, but also my hands and my head!"
G-John{_}704{_}10 Jesus said to him, "He who has  bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are  clean, but not every one of you."
G-John{_}705{_}11 For he knew who was to betray him;  that was why he said, "You are not all clean."
G-John{_}706{_}12 When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and  returned to his place, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to  you?
G-John{_}707{_}13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.
G-John{_}708{_}14  If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to  wash one another's feet.
G-John{_}709{_}15 For I have given you an example, that you  should do as I have done to you.
G-John{_}710{_}16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is  not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent  him.
G-John{_}711{_}17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
G-John{_}712{_}18 I am  not speaking of you all.
G-John{_}713{_}I know whom I have chosen; but that the  Scripture may be fulfilled, 'he who ate my bread has lifted up his heel  against me.'
G-John{_}714{_}19 Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does take  place, you may believe that I am he.
G-John{_}715{_}20 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who  receives anyone I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him  who sent me."
G-John{_}716{_}21 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and  testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."
G-John{_}717{_}22 The  disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.
G-John{_}718{_}23 One of  his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning close to the breast of Jesus.
G-John{_}719{_}24 Simon Peter motioned to him and said, "Ask who it is of whom he  speaks."
G-John{_}720{_}25 Then, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, he said to him,  "Lord, who is it?"
G-John{_}721{_}26 Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I shall give this  piece of bread when I have dipped it."
G-John{_}722{_}And having dipped the bread, he  gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
G-John{_}723{_}27 Then after the bread, Satan  entered into him.
G-John{_}724{_}Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do  quickly."
G-John{_}725{_}28 But no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
G-John{_}726{_}29  Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling  him, "Buy what we need for the feast"; or, that he should give something  to the poor.
G-John{_}727{_}30 Having received the piece of bread, he went out  immediately.
G-John{_}728{_}And it was night.
G-John{_}729{_}31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man  glorified, and in him God is glorified.
G-John{_}730{_}32 If God is glorified in him, God  will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.
G-John{_}731{_}33 Little  children, I shall be with you a little while longer.
G-John{_}732{_}You will seek me; and  as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come,' so now I say  to you.
G-John{_}733{_}34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another;  as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
G-John{_}734{_}35 By this all men  will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
G-John{_}735{_}36 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?"
G-John{_}736{_}Jesus  answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall  follow afterward."
G-John{_}737{_}37 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you  now?
G-John{_}738{_}I will lay down my life for you."
G-John{_}739{_}38 Jesus answered, "Will you lay  down your life for me?
G-John{_}740{_}Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow,  till you have denied me three times.
G-John{_}741{_}14 	1 "Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also  in me.
G-John{_}742{_}2 In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would  have told you.
G-John{_}743{_}I go to prepare a place for you.
G-John{_}744{_}3 And if I go and prepare a  place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am  you may be also.
G-John{_}745{_}4 And you know the way where I am going."
G-John{_}746{_}5 Thomas  said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going, and how can we  know the way?"
G-John{_}747{_}6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the  life.
G-John{_}748{_}No one comes to the Father except through me.
G-John{_}749{_}7 If you had known  me, you would have known my Father also; and from now on you know  him and have seen him."
G-John{_}750{_}8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father,  and that will be enough for us."
G-John{_}751{_}9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with  you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip?
G-John{_}752{_}He who has seen me  has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
G-John{_}753{_}10 Do you  not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
G-John{_}754{_}The words that I  say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells  in me does his works.
G-John{_}755{_}11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the  Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.
G-John{_}756{_}12  Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works  that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the  Father.
G-John{_}757{_}13 And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, that the Father  may be glorified in the Son.
G-John{_}758{_}14 If you ask anything in my name, I will do  it.
G-John{_}759{_}15 "If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
G-John{_}760{_}16 And I  will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with  you forever  17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,  because it neither sees him nor knows him; but you know him, for he  dwells with you and will be in you.
G-John{_}761{_}18 I will not leave you orphans; I will  come to you.
G-John{_}762{_}19 A little while longer, and the world will see me no more,  but you will see me.
G-John{_}763{_}Because I live, you will live also.
G-John{_}764{_}20 In that day you  will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
G-John{_}765{_}21 He who  has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me.
G-John{_}766{_}And he  who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and  manifest myself to him."
G-John{_}767{_}22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, how  is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?"
G-John{_}768{_}23 Jesus  answered him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father  will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
G-John{_}769{_}24  He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which  you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
G-John{_}770{_}25 "These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you.
G-John{_}771{_}26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my  name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that  I have said to you.
G-John{_}772{_}27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not  as the world gives do I give to you.
G-John{_}773{_}Let not your hearts be troubled,  neither let them be afraid.
G-John{_}774{_}28 You have heard me say to you, 'I am going  away and coming back to you.'
G-John{_}775{_}If you loved me, you would rejoice  because I said, 'I am going to the Father,' for the Father is greater than I.
G-John{_}776{_}29 And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does  take place, you may believe.
G-John{_}777{_}30 I will no longer talk much with you, for  the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me.
G-John{_}778{_}31 But I do as  the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the  Father.
G-John{_}779{_}Rise, let us go from here.
G-John{_}780{_}15 	1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
G-John{_}781{_}2 Every  branch in me that bears no fruit he takes away; and every branch that does  bear fruit he prunes, so that it may bear more fruit.
G-John{_}782{_}3 You are already  clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
G-John{_}783{_}4 Abide in me, and  I in you.
G-John{_}784{_}As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the  vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.
G-John{_}785{_}5 I am the vine, you are the  branches.
G-John{_}786{_}He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for  apart from me you can do nothing.
G-John{_}787{_}6 If anyone does not abide in me, he is  like a branch that is cast away and withers; and the branches are gathered,  thrown into the fire and burned.
G-John{_}788{_}7 If you abide in me, and my words abide  in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.
G-John{_}789{_}8 By this my  Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my  disciples.
G-John{_}790{_}9 As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; abide in  my love.
G-John{_}791{_}10 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,  just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
G-John{_}792{_}11 "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in  you, and that your joy may be full.
G-John{_}793{_}12 This is my commandment, that you  love one another as I have loved you.
G-John{_}794{_}13 Greater love has no one than this,  that he lay down his life for his friends.
G-John{_}795{_}14 You are my friends if you do  what I command you.
G-John{_}796{_}15 No longer do I call you servants, for a servant  does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for  all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
G-John{_}797{_}16 You  did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go  and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask  the Father in my name he may give you.
G-John{_}798{_}17 This I command you, that you  love one another.
G-John{_}799{_}18 "If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated  you.
G-John{_}800{_}19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
G-John{_}801{_}But  because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world,  therefore the world hates you.
G-John{_}802{_}20 Remember the word that I said to you,  'A servant is not greater than his master.'
G-John{_}803{_}If they persecuted me, they will  also persecute you.
G-John{_}804{_}If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
G-John{_}805{_}21  But all this they will do to you for my name's sake, because they do not  know him who sent me.
G-John{_}806{_}22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they  would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
G-John{_}807{_}23 He who  hates me hates my Father also.
G-John{_}808{_}24 If I had not done among them the works  which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen  and hated both me and my Father.
G-John{_}809{_}25 But this is to fulfill the word that is  written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'
G-John{_}810{_}26 "But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you  from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will  testify of me.
G-John{_}811{_}27 And you also will bear witness, because you have been  with me from the beginning.
G-John{_}812{_}16 	1 "I have said all this to you so that you will not go astray.
G-John{_}813{_}2  They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming when  whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.
G-John{_}814{_}3 And they will  do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.
G-John{_}815{_}4 But I  have told you these things, that when the time comes, you may remember  that I told you of them.
G-John{_}816{_}"I did not say these things to you at the beginning, because I was  with you.
G-John{_}817{_}5 But now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks  me, 'Where are you going?'
G-John{_}818{_}6 But because I have said these things to you,  sorrow has filled your heart.
G-John{_}819{_}7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to  your advantage that I go away.
G-John{_}820{_}For if I do not go away, the Counselor will  not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
G-John{_}821{_}8 And when he  comes, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of  judgment: 9 of sin, because they do not believe in me; 10 of  righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you see me no more; 11 of  judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
G-John{_}822{_}12 "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear  them now.
G-John{_}823{_}13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you  into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he  hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to come.
G-John{_}824{_}14 He will glorify  me, for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you.
G-John{_}825{_}15 All that the  Father has is mine.
G-John{_}826{_}Therefore I said that he will take of what is mine and  declare it to you.
G-John{_}827{_}16 "A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little  while, and you will see me."
G-John{_}828{_}17 Then some of his disciples said to one  another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you will not  see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'; and, 'because I go  to the Father'?"
G-John{_}829{_}18 They said, "What does he mean by 'a little while'?
G-John{_}830{_}We  do not know what he is saying."
G-John{_}831{_}19 Now Jesus knew that they wanted to  ask him, so he said to them, "Are you asking yourselves about what I  meant when I said, 'A little while, and you will not see me; and again a  little while, and you will see me'?
G-John{_}832{_}20 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will  weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but  your sorrow will turn into joy.
G-John{_}833{_}21 When a woman is in labor she has  sorrow, because her hour has come; but as soon as she gives birth to the  child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been  born into the world.
G-John{_}834{_}22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again  and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.
G-John{_}835{_}23 In  that day you will ask me nothing.
G-John{_}836{_}Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you  ask the Father in my name he will give you.
G-John{_}837{_}24 Until now you have asked  nothing in my name.
G-John{_}838{_}Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.
G-John{_}839{_}25 "I have said this to you in figurative language; but the time is  coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but I will tell you  plainly about the Father.
G-John{_}840{_}26 In that day you will ask in my name.
G-John{_}841{_}And I do  not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; 27 for the Father  himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I  came from God.
G-John{_}842{_}28 I came from the Father and have come into the world;  again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father."
G-John{_}843{_}29 His disciples  said, "See, now you are speaking plainly, and not using a figure of  speech!
G-John{_}844{_}30 Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need  for anyone to question you.
G-John{_}845{_}By this we believe that you came from God."
G-John{_}846{_}31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
G-John{_}847{_}32 Indeed the hour is  coming, yes, has now come, when you will be scattered, each to his own,  and will leave me alone.
G-John{_}848{_}And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
G-John{_}849{_}33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace.
G-John{_}850{_}In the  world you will have tribulation.
G-John{_}851{_}But take courage!
G-John{_}852{_}I have overcome the  world."
G-John{_}853{_}17 	1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to  heaven, and said: "Father, the hour has come.
G-John{_}854{_}Glorify your Son, that your  Son also may glorify you, 2 as you have given him authority over all flesh,  that he should give eternal life to all those you have given him.
G-John{_}855{_}3 And this  is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus  Christ whom you have sent.
G-John{_}856{_}4 I have glorified you on the earth, having  finished the work which you have given me to do.
G-John{_}857{_}5 And now, Father,  glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you  before the world was made.
G-John{_}858{_}6 "I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given  me out of the world.
G-John{_}859{_}They were yours; you gave them to me, and they have  kept your word.
G-John{_}860{_}7 Now they know that everything you have given me  comes from you.
G-John{_}861{_}8 For I have given them the words which you have given  me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you;  and they have believed that you sent me.
G-John{_}862{_}9 I pray for them.
G-John{_}863{_}I am not  praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are  yours.
G-John{_}864{_}10 And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified  in them.
G-John{_}865{_}11 And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the  world, and I am coming to you.
G-John{_}866{_}Holy Father, keep them in your name   the name you gave me  that they may be one, even as we are one.
G-John{_}867{_}12  While I was with them, I kept them in your name  the name you gave me.
G-John{_}868{_}I have guarded them, and none of them is lost except the son of perdition,  that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
G-John{_}869{_}13 But now I am coming to you, and  these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in  themselves.
G-John{_}870{_}14 I have given them your word; and the world has hated them  because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
G-John{_}871{_}15 I do  not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should  keep them from the evil one.
G-John{_}872{_}16 They are not of the world, even as I am  not of the world.
G-John{_}873{_}17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
G-John{_}874{_}18 As  you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
G-John{_}875{_}19 And  for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.
G-John{_}876{_}20 "I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will  believe in me through their word; 21 that they all may be one, as you,  Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us, that the world  may believe that you sent me.
G-John{_}877{_}22 And the glory which you gave me I have  given them, that they may be one just as we are one: 23 I in them, and you  in me; that they may become perfectly one, and that the world may know  that you have sent me, and have loved them even as you have loved me.
G-John{_}878{_}24  Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me  where I am, that they may behold my glory which you have given me, for  you loved me before the foundation of the world.
G-John{_}879{_}25 O righteous Father,  the world has not known you, but I have known you; and these know that  you sent me.
G-John{_}880{_}26 I have made known to them your name, and will make it  known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in  them."
G-John{_}881{_}18 	1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his  disciples over the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and  his disciples entered.
G-John{_}882{_}2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the  place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples.
G-John{_}883{_}3 So Judas, having  received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests  and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
G-John{_}884{_}4 Then  Jesus, knowing all that was to come upon him, went forward and said to  them, "Whom do you seek?"
G-John{_}885{_}5 They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth."
G-John{_}886{_}Jesus said to them, "I am he."
G-John{_}887{_}And Judas, who betrayed him, was standing  with them.
G-John{_}888{_}6 When he said to them, "I am he," they drew back and fell to  the ground.
G-John{_}889{_}7 Again he asked them, "Whom do you seek?"
G-John{_}890{_}And they said,  "Jesus of Nazareth."
G-John{_}891{_}8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he.
G-John{_}892{_}So, if you  seek me, let these men go."
G-John{_}893{_}9 This happened so that the words which he  had spoken would be fulfilled, "Of those whom you gave me I have lost  none."
G-John{_}894{_}10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high  priest's servant, and cut off his right ear.
G-John{_}895{_}The servant's name was  Malchus.
G-John{_}896{_}11 Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword into its sheath; shall I  not drink the cup which the Father has given me?"
G-John{_}897{_}12 Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the  officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.
G-John{_}898{_}13 And they led him to  Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest  that year.
G-John{_}899{_}14 Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was  expedient that one man should die for the people.
G-John{_}900{_}15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.
G-John{_}901{_}As  this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the  courtyard of the high priest.
G-John{_}902{_}16 But Peter stood at the door outside.
G-John{_}903{_}Then  the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke  to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in.
G-John{_}904{_}17 Then the girl who  kept the door said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples,  are you?"
G-John{_}905{_}He said, "I am not."
G-John{_}906{_}18 Now the servants and officers had made  a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming  themselves.
G-John{_}907{_}Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
G-John{_}908{_}19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and  his teaching.
G-John{_}909{_}20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world.
G-John{_}910{_}I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come  together, and I have said nothing in secret.
G-John{_}911{_}21 Why do you ask me?
G-John{_}912{_}Ask  those who have heard me what I said to them.
G-John{_}913{_}They know what I said."
G-John{_}914{_}22  And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus  with his hand, saying, "Is that the way you answer the high priest?"
G-John{_}915{_}23  Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the  wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"
G-John{_}916{_}24 Then  Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
G-John{_}917{_}25 Now Simon Peter stood warming himself.
G-John{_}918{_}Therefore they said  to him, "You are not also one of his disciples, are you?"
G-John{_}919{_}He denied it and  said, "I am not."
G-John{_}920{_}26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of  him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden  with him?"
G-John{_}921{_}27 Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed.
G-John{_}922{_}28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it  was early morning.
G-John{_}923{_}But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so  that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
G-John{_}924{_}29 So Pilate  went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this  man?"
G-John{_}925{_}30 They answered him, "If he were not an evildoer, we would not  have handed him over to you."
G-John{_}926{_}31 Pilate said to them, "Take him  yourselves and judge him by your own law."
G-John{_}927{_}The Jews said to him, "It is  not lawful for us to put anyone to death."
G-John{_}928{_}32 This happened so that the  words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing by what death he  was going to die.
G-John{_}929{_}33 Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called  Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
G-John{_}930{_}34 Jesus  answered, "Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about  me?"
G-John{_}931{_}35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew?
G-John{_}932{_}Your own nation and the chief  priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?"
G-John{_}933{_}36 Jesus  answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.
G-John{_}934{_}If my kingdom were of this  world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the  Jews; but now my kingship is not from here."
G-John{_}935{_}37 Pilate said to him, "You  are a king then?"
G-John{_}936{_}Jesus answered, "You say what I ama king.
G-John{_}937{_}For this I  was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the  truth.
G-John{_}938{_}Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."
G-John{_}939{_}38 Pilate said to him,  "What is truth?"
G-John{_}940{_}After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told  them, "I find no crime in him.
G-John{_}941{_}39 But you have a custom that I should  release one man for you at the Passover.
G-John{_}942{_}So do you want me to release to  you the King of the Jews?"
G-John{_}943{_}40 Then they all cried again, "Not this man,  but Barabbas!"
G-John{_}944{_}Now Barabbas was a robber.
G-John{_}945{_}19 	1 So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.
G-John{_}946{_}2 And the soldiers  twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in  a purple robe.
G-John{_}947{_}3 They came up to him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
G-John{_}948{_}and struck him with their hands.
G-John{_}949{_}4 Pilate went out again, and said to  them, "See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find  no crime in him."
G-John{_}950{_}5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and  the purple robe.
G-John{_}951{_}Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"
G-John{_}952{_}6 When the chief  priests and officers saw him, they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!"
G-John{_}953{_}Pilate said to them, "You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in  him."
G-John{_}954{_}7 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to that  law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
G-John{_}955{_}8 When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid, 9 and  he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, "Where are you  from?"
G-John{_}956{_}But Jesus gave him no answer.
G-John{_}957{_}10 Pilate said to him, "You will  not speak to me?
G-John{_}958{_}Do you not know that I have power to release you, and  power to crucify you?"
G-John{_}959{_}11 Jesus answered, "You would have no power  over me unless it had been given you from above.
G-John{_}960{_}Therefore the one who  delivered me to you has the greater sin."
G-John{_}961{_}12 From then on Pilate sought to  release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you let this man go, you are not  Caesar's friend.
G-John{_}962{_}Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against  Caesar."
G-John{_}963{_}13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat  down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but in  Hebrew, Gabbatha.
G-John{_}964{_}14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover,  about the sixth hour.
G-John{_}965{_}And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"
G-John{_}966{_}15  But they cried out, "Away with him!
G-John{_}967{_}Away with him!
G-John{_}968{_}Crucify him!"
G-John{_}969{_}Pilate  said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"
G-John{_}970{_}The chief priests answered,  "We have no King but Caesar."
G-John{_}971{_}16 Then he handed him over to them to be  crucified.
G-John{_}972{_}So they took Jesus.
G-John{_}973{_}17 And he, bearing his cross, went out to a  place called the Place of the Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
G-John{_}974{_}18 There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side,  and Jesus in the center.
G-John{_}975{_}19 Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross.
G-John{_}976{_}It  read:   JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
G-John{_}977{_}20 Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was  crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and  Latin.
G-John{_}978{_}21 The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not write,  'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'"
G-John{_}979{_}22  Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
G-John{_}980{_}23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his  garments, and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic.
G-John{_}981{_}Now the tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
G-John{_}982{_}24 So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it,  whose it shall be."
G-John{_}983{_}This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled  which says:  	"They divided my garments among them,  		and for my clothing they cast lots."
G-John{_}984{_}This is what the soldiers did.
G-John{_}985{_}25 By the cross of Jesus stood his mother,  and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
G-John{_}986{_}26  When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by,  he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"
G-John{_}987{_}27 Then he said to the  disciple, "Behold, your mother!"
G-John{_}988{_}And from that hour the disciple took her  to his own home.
G-John{_}989{_}28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished,  that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I thirst."
G-John{_}990{_}29 Now a vessel full  of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar,  put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
G-John{_}991{_}30 So when Jesus had received  the vinegar, he said, "It is finished!"
G-John{_}992{_}And he bowed his head and gave up  his spirit.
G-John{_}993{_}31 Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the  bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath  was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and  that they might be taken away.
G-John{_}994{_}32 Then the soldiers came and broke the  legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.
G-John{_}995{_}33 But  when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not  break his legs.
G-John{_}996{_}34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,  and immediately blood and water came out.
G-John{_}997{_}35 He who saw it has  testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth,  that you also may believe.
G-John{_}998{_}36 For these things were done that the scripture  should be fulfilled, "Not one of his bones shall be broken."
G-John{_}999{_}37 And again  another scripture says, "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."
G-John{_}1000{_}38 After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,  but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the  body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission.
G-John{_}1001{_}So he came and took away  his body.
G-John{_}1002{_}39 And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night,  also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred  pounds.
G-John{_}1003{_}40 So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen  with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
G-John{_}1004{_}41 Now in the place  where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb  in which no one had ever been laid.
G-John{_}1005{_}42 So because of the Jewish day of  Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
G-John{_}1006{_}20 	1 On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb  early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away  from the tomb.
G-John{_}1007{_}2 So she ran, and came to Simon Peter and the other  disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken  the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him."
G-John{_}1008{_}3 Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going  toward the tomb.
G-John{_}1009{_}4 They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and  reached the tomb first.
G-John{_}1010{_}5 And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths  lying there, but he did not go in.
G-John{_}1011{_}6 Then Simon Peter came, following  him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there, 7  and the napkin that had been around his head, not lying with the linen  cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.
G-John{_}1012{_}8 Then the other disciple, who  reached the tomb first, also went in; and he saw and believed.
G-John{_}1013{_}9 For as yet  they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
G-John{_}1014{_}10 Then  the disciples went back to their homes.
G-John{_}1015{_}11 But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept  she stooped to look into the tomb.
G-John{_}1016{_}12 And she saw two angels in white,  sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at  the feet.
G-John{_}1017{_}13 They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"
G-John{_}1018{_}She said  to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know  where they have laid him."
G-John{_}1019{_}14 Saying this, she turned around and saw  Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
G-John{_}1020{_}15 Jesus said  to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?
G-John{_}1021{_}Whom are you seeking?"
G-John{_}1022{_}Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have  carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him  away."
G-John{_}1023{_}16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!"
G-John{_}1024{_}She turned and said to him in  Hebrew, "Rabboni!"
G-John{_}1025{_}(which means, Teacher).
G-John{_}1026{_}17 Jesus said to her, "Do  not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my  brethren and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father,  to my God and your God.'"
G-John{_}1027{_}18 Mary Magdalene went and said to the  disciples, "I have seen the Lord!"
G-John{_}1028{_}And she told them that he had said  these things to her.
G-John{_}1029{_}19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the  doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus  came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
G-John{_}1030{_}20  When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
G-John{_}1031{_}Then the  disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
G-John{_}1032{_}21 Jesus said to them again,  "Peace be with you!
G-John{_}1033{_}As the Father has sent me, I also send you."
G-John{_}1034{_}22 And  when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive  the Holy Spirit.
G-John{_}1035{_}23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them;  if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."
G-John{_}1036{_}24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not  with them when Jesus came.
G-John{_}1037{_}25 So the other disciples told him, "We have  seen the Lord."
G-John{_}1038{_}But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print  of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand  in his side, I will not believe."
G-John{_}1039{_}26 Eight days later, his disciples were  again in the house, and Thomas was with them.
G-John{_}1040{_}The doors were shut, but  Jesus came and stood among them, and said, "Peace be with you!"
G-John{_}1041{_}27  Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands.
G-John{_}1042{_}Reach  out your hand, and put it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but  believing."
G-John{_}1043{_}28 Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
G-John{_}1044{_}29 Jesus  said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me?
G-John{_}1045{_}Blessed are  those who have not seen and yet have believed."
G-John{_}1046{_}30 Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples,  which are not written in this book; 31 but these are written that you may  believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you  may have life in his name.
G-John{_}1047{_}21 	1 After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the  Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself: 2 Simon Peter,  Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of  Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
G-John{_}1048{_}3 Simon Peter  said to them, "I am going fishing."
G-John{_}1049{_}They said to him, "We will go with  you."
G-John{_}1050{_}They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught  nothing.
G-John{_}1051{_}4 But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the  disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
G-John{_}1052{_}5 Jesus said to them, "Children,  have you any fish?"
G-John{_}1053{_}They answered him, "No."
G-John{_}1054{_}6 He said to them, "Cast  the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some."
G-John{_}1055{_}So they  cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number  of fish.
G-John{_}1056{_}7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the  Lord!"
G-John{_}1057{_}Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his  outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw himself into the sea.
G-John{_}1058{_}8  But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for  they were not far from land, but about a hundred yards off.
G-John{_}1059{_}9 When they  had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and  bread.
G-John{_}1060{_}10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just  caught."
G-John{_}1061{_}11 Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of  large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many,  the net was not torn.
G-John{_}1062{_}12 Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast."
G-John{_}1063{_}Now none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?"
G-John{_}1064{_}They knew it  was the Lord.
G-John{_}1065{_}13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and  did the same with the fish.
G-John{_}1066{_}14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared  to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
G-John{_}1067{_}15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
G-John{_}1068{_}He said to him,  "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you."
G-John{_}1069{_}He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
G-John{_}1070{_}16 He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love  me?"
G-John{_}1071{_}He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you."
G-John{_}1072{_}He said to  him, "Tend my sheep."
G-John{_}1073{_}17 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of  John, do you love me?"
G-John{_}1074{_}Peter was grieved because he said to him the third  time, "Do you love me?"
G-John{_}1075{_}And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things;  you know that I love you."
G-John{_}1076{_}Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
G-John{_}1077{_}18 Truly,  truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and  walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your  hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to  go."
G-John{_}1078{_}19 This he said to show by what death he would glorify God.
G-John{_}1079{_}And  after this he said to him, "Follow me."
G-John{_}1080{_}20 Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus  loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, "Lord,  who is the one who is going to betray you?"
G-John{_}1081{_}21 When Peter saw him, he  said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"
G-John{_}1082{_}22 Jesus said to him, "If I  want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?
G-John{_}1083{_}You follow me."
G-John{_}1084{_}23  Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not  die.
G-John{_}1085{_}Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I want him  to remain until I come, what is that to you?"
G-John{_}1086{_}24 This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who  wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
G-John{_}1087{_}25 But there are also many other things which Jesus did.
G-John{_}1088{_}If every  one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could  not contain the books that would be written.
