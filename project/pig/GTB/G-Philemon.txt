G-Philemon{_}1{_}The Letter of Paul  to Philemon  1 	1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to  Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker, 2 and to Apphia our  sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your  house: 3 grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus  Christ.
G-Philemon{_}2{_}4 I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, 5  because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the  Lord Jesus and all the saints, 6 and I pray that the sharing of your faith  may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing that is  ours in Christ.
G-Philemon{_}3{_}7 For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love,  my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through  you.
G-Philemon{_}4{_}8 Therefore, though I am bold enough in Christ to order you to  do what is proper, 9 yet for love's sake I rather appeal to yousince I am  such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ  Jesus10 I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have  become in my imprisonment.
G-Philemon{_}5{_}11 Formerly he was useless to you, but now  he is useful both to you and to me.
G-Philemon{_}6{_}12 I am sending him back to you,  sending my very heart.
G-Philemon{_}7{_}13 I would have been glad to keep him with me, so  that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the  gospel; 14 but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that  your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own  free will.
G-Philemon{_}8{_}15 Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a  while, that you might have him back for ever, 16 no longer as a slave, but  more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much  more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
G-Philemon{_}9{_}17 So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would  welcome me.
G-Philemon{_}10{_}18 If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything,  charge that to my account.
G-Philemon{_}11{_}19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I  will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self.
G-Philemon{_}12{_}20  Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my  heart in Christ.
G-Philemon{_}13{_}21 Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that  you will do even more than I say.
G-Philemon{_}14{_}22 At the same time, prepare a guest  room for me, for I hope through your prayers to be granted to you.
G-Philemon{_}15{_}23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you  greetings, 24 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow  workers.
G-Philemon{_}16{_}25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
