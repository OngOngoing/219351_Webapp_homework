Introduction_and_Copyright{_}2{_}The Common  Edition: New Testament  	The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the  New Testament and numerous English translations in the modern church.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}3{_}The goals for this edition are:  1)	To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly  readable, 2)	To  balance traditional wording with modern English, and 3)	To reflect the standard Christian understanding and  wording of the New Testament.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}4{_}The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New  Testament for the modern English reader.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}5{_}There are two ways to create a standardized text.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}6{_}The first way  is to create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps  centuries.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}7{_}The second way is to isolate what the most widely used  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common,  and place the results in a single text.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}8{_}The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}9{_}Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts  to create a new English standard Bible.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}10{_}Each of these attempts has  sought to produce a standardized edition in the first way I have described.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}11{_}The Common Edition New Testament follows the second method.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}12{_}A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between  extremes.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}13{_}The most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to  read.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}14{_}The most traditionally worded may not be very modern.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}15{_}It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and  theologians may not be best for the daily devotional reader.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}16{_}Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}17{_}One  reviewer gave me the highest compliment I could receive when he said,  "there's nothing new about it!"
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}18{_}I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they  would expect from a standardized edition, and that no matter what  versions they have used in the past, they will find something familiar  here.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}19{_}This initial release into the public domain is intended for free  distribution.

Introduction_and_Copyright{_}23{_}4)	The text may not be altered.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}24{_}5)	No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document  published for sale without the express written permission of  the editor.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}25{_}6)	No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be  quoted from this edition without the express written  permission of the editor.

Introduction_and_Copyright{_}28{_}If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you  believe needs review, please email the editor at teclontz@aol.com.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}29{_}Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to  any individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many  people who have labored to preserve this text.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}30{_}Those who penned the  autographs often faced ridicule or death.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}31{_}Nameless monks sleep in the  dust, who faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the  centuries.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}32{_}By the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one  wish: to make the Christian Bible available in English to the poorest  farmhand in England.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}33{_}For this crime he was strangled and burned at the  stake.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}34{_}And then there are those who have simply loved these words  enough to live by their highest ideals.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}35{_}Without the goodness of their  lives no one would believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}36{_}One  such godly man was M. D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just  so that he could make this word his own.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}37{_}My grandfather, Bill Clontz,  who will always be an example for my family, gradually bought larger  and larger print Bibles and finally began using the Bible on tape  just to  keep the Word fresh in his heart.
Introduction_and_Copyright{_}38{_}Such people always stay fresh in the  hearts of those who have known them, and their love for God is  contagious.
